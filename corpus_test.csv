"Walking through Nagu, a small town in the mountains of southwestern China, the signs of a vibrant Muslim community are ubiquitous. Loudspeakers broadcast passages from a Chinese translation of the Quran. Women in head scarves shuttle rowdy children home from school. Arabic script decorates the outside of homes.",走在中国西南部山区的纳古镇，一个生机勃勃的穆斯林社区的迹象随处可见。扩音器里播放着中译古兰经的段落。戴着头巾的女子把闹哄哄的孩子们从学校接回家。房屋外面涂着阿拉伯文的装饰。
"Towering over it all is the Najiaying Mosque, a white building topped with an emerald dome and four minarets that reach 230 feet into the air. For decades, the mosque has been the pride of the Muslim Hui ethnic minority that lives here.",纳家营清真寺高耸在这一切之上。这座高达70米的白色建筑有一个翡翠色的穹顶和四个宣礼塔。几十年来，这座清真寺一直是居住在这里的回族(信奉穆斯林的少数民族)人的骄傲。
"Last month, it was also the scene of a confrontation.",上个月，这里也成了冲突的现场。
"On the morning of May 27, after the authorities drove construction cranes into the mosque's courtyard, a crowd of residents confronted the hundreds of police officers in riot gear who had been deployed to oversee the work. As the officers blocked the mosque and used pepper spray, residents threw water bottles and bricks.",5月27日清晨，在当局将两辆起重机开进清真寺的院子时，一群居民与数百名被派来监视拆除工程、配有防暴装备的警察发生了冲突。警察封锁了清真寺，并向抗议者喷辣椒水，居民们向警察投掷水瓶和砖头。
"The rare clashes, described in interviews with eyewitnesses and captured on videos posted on social media, show how one aspect of the Chinese Communist Party's campaign to exert greater control over religion could grow more volatile.",通过目击者在接受采访时的描述和社交媒体上发布的视频，可以了解到这些罕见的冲突，它们表明在中国共产党加强宗教控制行动中，有时可能会出现较为动荡的局面。
"Since China's leader, Xi Jinping, rose to power more than a decade ago, the party has torn down Christian churches, razed Tibetan Buddhist enclaves and put Uyghur Muslims in internment camps in the name of political security. But it has also gone after lesser-known groups, including theHui, who make up less than 1 percent of the population and have historically assimilated well with the ethnic Han majority.",自从中国领导人习近平在十多年前上台以来，中共以政治安全的名义拆毁了基督教教堂，夷平了藏传佛教徒的居住地，并将维吾尔穆斯林关入拘禁营。但它还打击了一些受关注较少的群体，包括回族。回族占人口的比例不到1%，历史上与占人口多数的汉族同化良好。
"The party has systematically closed, demolished or forcibly redesigned mosques in Hui enclaves across the country, condemning Arabic architectural features, such as domes and minarets, as proof of unwanted foreign influence over Islam in China. Resistance has been limited, and the mosque in Nagu, along with another large one in the nearby town of Shadian,isamong the last major ones with such architecture still standing in China.",中共有计划地关闭、拆除或强行重新设计全国各地回族聚居区的清真寺，将穹顶和宣礼塔等阿拉伯建筑特征斥为外国对中国伊斯兰教产生有害影响的证据。抵抗是有限的，纳古的清真寺，以及附近沙甸镇的另一座大型清真寺是中国仅存的几座大型清真寺之一。
"But when local officials announced plans to remove bothmosques'domes and remake theirminarets in a purportedly more ""Chinese"" style, people in Nagufought back.","但当地官员宣布计划拆除两座清真寺的穹顶，并以据称更""中国""的风格重建宣礼塔时，纳古人做出了反抗。"
"""This roof represents our respect and freedom. We chose it freely ourselves at the time,"" said Mr. Na, a Hui resident in his 30s, who asked to be identified only by his last name for fear of government retaliation. His family, like many in town, had helped fund the mosque's most recent renovations in the early 2000s, when the minarets were added. ""Now they are saying, 'My rule overrides your free choice.'""","""我们把这个顶，当作我们的尊严、自由，当时是我们自由选择的，""30多岁的回民纳先生说，因为担心政府报复，他要求记者只给出他的姓。他家人和镇上的许多人一样，曾在本世纪初帮助该清真寺最近的一次翻修筹集资金，宣礼塔就是那次添加的。""现在它就是说，我的统治意义是凌驾于你的自由选择之上。"""
"The mosques in Nagu and Shadian hold particular importance in the story of Beijing's relationship with Islam, which has fluctuated between conflict and coexistence. Yunnan Province, where both Nagu and Shadian are, is China's most ethnically diverse, and the Hui people most of whom speak Mandarin but are distinguished by their Muslim faith have lived there for centuries. The earliest version of Nagu'smosque was built in the 14th century, in a traditional Chinese courtyard style. Yunnan's Muslims prospered as merchants trading with Southeast Asia.",纳古和沙甸的清真寺在中国政府与伊斯兰教时而冲突、时而共存的关系史上尤为重要。 纳古和沙甸所在的云南省是中国少数民族最多的省份，而大多数人都说普通话、以穆斯林信仰著称的回族已在云南各地生活了几个世纪。纳古的清真寺始建于14世纪，带有传统的中国庭院风格。云南的穆斯林因为与东南亚的贸易而繁荣起来。
"Then, after the Communist takeover, officials began to attack religion as counterrevolutionary, especially during the 1966-1976 period of political upheaval known as the Cultural Revolution. Muslims in Shadian resisted, and in 1975 the military razed the town and massacred as many as 1,600 residents.","后来，掌权后的中共官员将宗教视为一股反革命势力，开始对其进行打击，尤其是在被称为""文化大革命""的(1966年至1976年)十年政治动荡时期。沙甸的穆斯林曾与政府发生对抗，1975年，军队在当地进行镇压，将镇子夷为平地，造成多达1600名平民死亡。"
"After the Cultural Revolution, as China opened to the world, the government apologizedfor the massacre. It supported the reconstruction of Shadian and permitted locals many of whom could travel abroad for the first time to build the Grand Mosque, the largest in southwestern China, in its present Arabic style. Modeled after the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia, the building can hold 10,000 people, and its minarets are visible from miles away. Officials promoted it as a tourist site.","""文革""后，随着中国向世界开放，政府曾为那场大屠杀道歉，支持沙甸的重建，并允许当地人——其中许多人是第一次获许出国旅行——修建了现在这座阿拉伯风格的大清真寺，它是中国西南地区最大的一座清真寺。沙甸大清真寺以沙特阿拉伯麦地那的先知清真寺为蓝本，可容纳一万人，其宣礼塔在数公里外就可看到。官方曾将其作为旅游景点来宣传。"
"The Nagu mosque, 90 miles from Shadian, also grew and evolved, becoming a regional training center for imams. When locals, starting in the 1980s, added a dome and other Arabic features, the government did not interfere. In 2018, the local government designated it a cultural relic.",距沙甸约140公里的纳家营清真寺也在这期间变得更大、建筑风格发生了变化，成了一个阿訇宗教培训中心。当地人从20世纪80年代起给清真寺加盖穹顶、增添其他阿拉伯特征时，政府并没有干预。2018年，地方政府将其定为文物。
"""These mosques symbolize that the Chinese government accepted that they were wrong during the Cultural Revolution,"" said Ruslan Yusupov, a scholar of China and Islam at Harvard University. The Shadian mosque in particular, he said, serves as a reminder ""both about violence but also about state-sponsored recovery.""","""这些清真寺是中国政府承认他们在文化大革命期间犯了错误的象征，""在哈佛大学研究中国和伊斯兰教的学者鲁斯兰·尤苏波夫说。尤其是沙甸的清真寺，他说，它""既是关于暴力，也是关于国家支持的复苏""的提醒。"
"But in recent years, restrictions on Islam began accumulating again, especially after a 2014 attackon civilians at a train station in Kunming, Yunnan's capital, that left 31 people dead. The Chinese government said the attackers were Uyghur separatists who had spent time in Shadian.",但近年来，政府对伊斯兰教的限制开始变得越来越多，尤其是在2014年的袭击事件之后，那次发生在云南省省会昆明火车站的袭击平民事件导致了31人死亡。中国政府称，袭击者是曾住在沙甸的维吾尔分裂分子。
"Officials stopped promoting Shadian. In Nagu, female teachers were barred from wearing head scarves at school, residents said. A volunteer group there no longer offers free tutoring in the mosque, after officials stepped up controls on education.",官员们不再宣传沙甸。居民说，在纳古，当局禁止女教师在学校戴头巾。官员加强了对教育的控制之后，那里的一个志愿小组不再在清真寺提供免费辅导。
"In 2021, the so-called Sinicization campaign to remove Arabic features arrived in Nagu. Government officials began visiting homes, sometimes on a daily basis, to coax residents to support changes to the mosque. A town billboard shows a rendering of the government's plan: the dome gone, the minarets decorated with pagoda-like tiers. Officials have also recently gone door-to-door in Shadian.",2021年，一场所谓的中国化运动降临纳古，这场运动的目的是消除阿拉伯特征。为了劝说当地居民支持对清真寺进行改造，政府官员开始登门拜访，有时甚至天天来。镇上一个广告牌展示着政府改造方案的效果图:穹顶没有了，宣礼塔变成了类似佛塔的建筑。官员们最近也开始在沙甸挨家挨户地走访。
"""Because of the sheer authority these places occupy in the imagination"" of local Muslims, ""they had to leave these two mosques to the very end,"" Mr. Yusupov said.","""由于这些地方(在当地穆斯林的)想象中占据绝对权威地位，他们不得不把这两座清真寺留到最后处理，""尤苏波夫说。"
"To Hui residents in Nagu, which The New York Times visited shortly after the protest, the remodeling plan was a precursor to a more sweeping repression of their way of life.",对当地回族居民来说，清真寺改造预示着政府将更全面地压制他们的生活方式。
"A woman in her 30s, also surnamed Na a common surname in Nagu said she had grown up playing and studying in the mosque. Neighbors and relatives had attended university elsewhere in China, but returned to Nagu for its small-town, pious atmosphere, where they could pass Muslim values onto their children.","一名也姓纳(""纳""是纳古的大姓)的30多岁女性说，她小时后经常在清真寺里玩耍和学习。曾到中国其他地方读大学的邻居和亲戚们毕业后回到纳古，因为他们喜欢这个小镇的虔诚氛围，可以在这里将穆斯林价值观传授给他们的孩子。"
"Ms. Na said she would be willing to accept the removal of the dome in isolation: ""Our faith is in our hearts, that's just a building."" But she worried, especially after seeing the authorities' forceful tactics, that it would not stop there.","纳女士说，如果拆除穹顶是件孤立的事情，她倒是能接受:""我们的信仰在心中，那只是一座建筑。""但她担心政府不会就此而止，尤其是在看到当局采取了强硬手段之后。"
"""The first step is exterior renovations,"" she said. ""The second step will be telling you to erase the Arabic script that we have on every home.""","""第一步是风貌改造，""她说。 ""第二步，他就让我们每家每户建筑上都有的阿拉伯文，门口也有，屋顶也有，和清真寺一样的，汉族说洋葱顶，他下一步要你自己把它们全部抹掉，不让写。"""
"The authorities are not backing down. Several hours after the clash began, the police retreated from the mosque, before the midday prayers. But the next day, the local authorities issued a notice denouncing the ""serious disruption of social order"" and promising a ""severe crackdown."" In the days afterward, local officials repeatedly blared that notice over loudspeakers, including late at night.","面对反对，当局没有让步。在冲突开始几小时后，警察曾一度在正午祈祷前撤出了清真寺。但地方当局第二天发布通告谴责这场""严重妨害社会管理秩序的案件""，并承诺要""严厉打击""。那之后的几天里，当地官员已多次(包括深夜)在扩音器里大声广播这份通告。"
"On China's heavily censored social media platforms, Islamophobic comments swelled, including from government-affiliated commentators.",在中国受到严格审查的社交媒体平台上，仇视伊斯兰教的评论激增，包括来自政府下属的评论员。
"In Nagu, residents were entering and exiting the mosque, but security remained tight, with a drone flying overhead. Plainclothes police officers approached a reporter from The Times and had her driven out of the town.",纳古的居民们仍在清真寺出入，但安保措施严密，一架无人机从头顶飞过。便衣警察来到时报记者身边，用车将她送出了镇子。
"The authorities in Shadian were also on high alert, with officials intercepting the reporter at the train station. Still, they agreed to take her to the Grand Mosque.",沙甸当局也处于高度戒备状态，官员在火车站阻拦了时报记者，但同意将她带到大清真寺。
"""Of course, the Quran came from Saudi Arabia, but after arriving in China, it must adapt,"" said Li Heng, an official from the local bureau of ethnic and religious affairs, as he stood in the plaza before the mosque.","""我们比如古兰经，他肯定在我们沙特这边传过来的，但是到我们中国后，它要做具体适应我们社会主义社会现在发展的解释。""当地的民族宗教事务局官员李恒(音)站在清真寺前的广场上说。"
"""When our imams give sermons,"" he said, ""they must integrate the core socialist values the government is promoting.""","""政府要求提倡的这些社会主义核心价值观这些正能量的东西要和古兰经进行相融合，""他说。"
"Mr. Li insisted that officials were not interfering with religious freedom, and that the plan would proceed only with locals' assent.",李恒坚称，官员不是在干涉宗教自由，改造方案只是在当地人同意的情况下才会进行。
"He added: ""Patriotism is the highest form of religious belief.""","他还说:""爱国才是爱教最高的信仰。"""
"Back in Nagu, the cranes still sat in the mosque courtyard several days after the clash. The demolition was likely inevitable, said Mr. Na, the Hui resident. But he hoped residents would be allowed to hold on to other freedoms that they were not willing to compromise. For him, that included the right to pass his religion onto his children.",回到纳古，起重机在冲突发生数日后仍停在清真寺的院子里。前面提到的回族居民纳先生说，拆除似乎已不可避免。但他希望能允许居民们保留一些他们不愿妥协的其他自由。就他本人而言，包括将自己的宗教信仰传授给孩子的权利。
"""If you can't guard your bottom line, then others will see you as someone without a bottom line,"" he said, ""and they'll trample over it again and again.""","""如果你没有能力守护你的底线的时候，那么对别人来讲你是没有底线的人，""他说，""他可以一次又一次的践踏你的底线。"""
"After ""Glory to Hong Kong"" emerged as the unofficial anthem of pro-democracy demonstrators in 2019, the government of Hong Kong has tried to stifle its use. It has banned the song from schools. When it was played in error last year instead of the Chinese national anthem at a rugby match in South Korea, the Hong Kong government demanded an investigation.",《愿荣光归香港》在2019年的民主抗议活动中成为示威者的非官方国歌后，香港政府一直试图将其禁止。当局已在学校将其列为禁歌。韩国去年举行亚洲七人橄榄球赛时错误地演奏这首歌而不是中国国歌之后，香港政府曾要求进行调查。
"This week the authorities asked a court to ban the public performance and online dissemination of ""Glory to Hong Kong."" The move could ensnare U.S. technology companies like Google and set up the first legal test of how much control the Hong Kong government can wield over online content.",本周，当局向法庭申请禁止公开表演、在网上传播《愿荣光归香港》。 这个做法可能会使谷歌等美国科技公司陷入困境，这也是香港政府对网络内容控制能力的首次法庭检验。
"Hong Kong is seeking to prohibit the distribution or reproduction of the song ""in any way,"" including adaptations of its ""melody or lyrics,"" the government said in a statement on Tuesday. It said that the song had been used to ""insult"" the Chinese national anthem, ""The March of the Volunteers,"" causing ""serious damage to the country"" and to Hong Kong. A date for the court to hear the request has not been set.","香港政府在周二的新闻公报中称，正在寻求禁止""以任何方式""发布或复制这首歌，包括""有关歌曲的改编本""。当局称，这首歌对中国国歌《义勇军进行曲》""造成侮辱，对国家和特区造成严重损害""。法庭听取申请的日期尚未确定。"
The Hong Kong authorities had previously criticized Google for displaying the protest song under search results for Hong Kong's national anthem.,"香港当局此前曾批评谷歌，在其平台上搜索""香港国歌""时，得到的结果包括这首抗议歌曲。"
"""We've already sent a request to Google to pin the correct national anthem but, regrettably, Google refused,"" said Chris Tang, the Hong Kong security secretary, at a news conference in December. ""I find this explanation unthinkable and the Hong Kong people will not tolerate it.""","""我们已向谷歌提出要求，将国歌正确置顶，可惜被谷歌拒绝，""香港保安局局长邓炳强在去年12月的记者会上说。""我相信这个说法匪夷所思，香港人不会接受。"""
"The government's request for a court injunction against the protest song, made on Monday, is the latest attempt by Hong Kong to root out the remaining vestiges of political dissent in the city, a former British colony that once enjoyed more political autonomy. Under China's president, Xi Jinping, Hong Kong has undergone a stark shift from its days as a prosperous hub for foreign businesses to a frontier in Beijing's campaign to safeguard national security.",政府在本周一向法庭申请了禁止播放或传播这首抗议歌曲的禁制令，这是当局为根除香港残留的政治异见所采取的最新尝试，香港曾是英国殖民地，有过更多的政治自治权。在中国国家主席习近平领导下，香港已发生了巨大的变化，从以前对外国企业友好的繁荣中心，变成了中国政府维护国家安全运动的前沿阵地。
"Last week, an annual vigil held on the anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing was shut down by officers, who arrested and detained protesters and suspected mourners.","上周，香港警方叫停每年为纪念1989年北京天安门广场民主运动举行的""六四""守夜活动，逮捕并拘留了抗议者和疑似悼念者。"
"In applying for the court injunction against the Hong Kong protest anthem, the government cites its national security law, which was enacted in 2020 and gave Beijing sweeping powers to crack down on what it deemed to be political crimes, including separatism and collusion.",香港政府向法院申请针对抗议歌曲的禁制令时，引用了2020年颁布的《香港国安法》，该法赋予中国政府广泛权力，来打击它认为的政治犯罪，包括分裂国家、勾结外国势力在内。
"If granted, a court injunction would likely make moderating content in Hong Kong more complicated and expensive for U.S. tech companies, said George Chen, managing director for the consulting firm The Asia Group and former head of public policy for Greater China at Meta. He said the government's decision to use the courts was ""opening the flood gates.""","如果申请得到批准，禁制令可能会使在香港运营的美国科技企业审核网上内容变得更复杂、成本也更高，咨询公司亚洲集团董事总经理、曾任Meta大中华区公共政策负责人的陈澍说。他称政府利用法庭的决定是""在打开闸门""。"
"""Glory to Hong Kong"" can be found in Hong Kong on such platforms as Meta's Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which is owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet.",在香港搜索《愿荣光归香港》时，用户在Meta的Facebook、Twitter，以及谷歌母公司Alphabet旗下的YouTube等平台上都能找到结果。
"According to Ming Pao, a centrist Chinese-language newspaper, the court application cited 32 links on YouTube related to the song.",据中间派中文报纸《明报》报道，政府提交给法庭的申请提到了YouTube上与这首歌有关的32个链接。
Google and Meta declined to comment. Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.,谷歌和Meta拒绝为本文置评。Twitter没有回应置评请求。
"U.S. technology companies typically follow the rules of the countries and regions where they operate and, at times, remove content. The potential scope of an injunction in Hong Kong was not clear. Critics say the national security law was written with the intent of policing conduct even outside of Hong Kong.",美国科技企业通常遵守其运营所在国家和地区的法律法规，有时会删除内容。香港禁制令可能的适用范围目前不清楚。批评人士说，《香港国安法》的制定是以监管香港以外的行为为目的的。
"""Anyone in the world can violate the Hong Kong national security law,"" said Lokman Tsui, former head of free expression for Asia Pacific at Google. ""The question is whether this injunction is similar in scope.""","""世界任何地方的人都能违反《香港国安法》，""曾任谷歌亚太地区言论自由部门负责人的徐洛文说。""问题是这项禁制令的适用范围上是否与国安法相似。"""
"Refusal to comply with a decision by a Hong Kong court could endanger a company's staff and business in the region, Mr. Tsui added.",拒绝遵守香港法院的裁决会危及公司在该地区的员工和业务，徐洛文补充说。
"For now, the efforts to suppress the song appear to have driven a wave of interest in it: On Wednesday, eight different versions of ""Glory to Hong Kong"" topped the singles charts of iTunes in Hong Kong.",就目前而言，压制这首抗议歌曲的努力似乎引发了人们对它的兴趣:八个不同版本的《愿荣光归香港》在香港的iTunes单曲榜上名列前茅。
"For years, even as China has been largely closed off to foreign internet companies, Hong Kong remained an exceptiona hub where foreign businesses could operate relatively free of the censorship controls they would face on the mainland.",多年来，尽管中国在很大程度上屏蔽了外国互联网公司的网站，但香港仍是例外——外国企业可以在这里相对自由地运营，不受他们在大陆面临的那些审查控制。
"The escalation of the Hong Kong government's efforts to proscribe speech could further damage the city's image as a financial and economic center for China and Asia, said Willy Lam, a senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation, a think tank in Washington. ""We've already seen many multinational businesses move their personnel to Singapore and other places, now there will be less multinationals choosing to base themselves in Hong Kong.""","香港政府升级限制言论的努力可能会进一步损害香港作为中国、乃至亚洲金融和经济中心的形象，华盛顿智库詹姆斯敦基金会高级研究员林和立说。 ""我们已经看到很多跨国企业将人员转移到新加坡和其他地方，现在选择落户香港的跨国公司将越来越少。"""
"""This is another nail in the coffin for Hong Kong,"" he added.","""这是导致香港失败的又一个做法，""他补充说。"
"In a rare victory for journalism amid a crackdown on the news media in Hong Kong, the city's top court on Monday overturned the conviction of a prominent reporter who had produced a documentary that was critical of the police.",周一，香港最高法院推翻了对一名著名记者的定罪，该记者制作了一部批评警方的纪录片。在香港新闻媒体遭受打压之际，这是新闻业的一次罕见胜利。
"Choy Yuk-ling, who also goes by the name Bao Choy, is best known in Hong Kong for producing investigative documentaries examining police conduct in 2019, when the city was roiled by months of antigovernment protests.",蔡玉玲(又名阿包)因制作检视2019年警察行为的调查性纪录片闻名香港，当时该市因数月的反政府抗议活动陷入动荡。
"Among the documentaries she produced was a prizewinning episode of ""Hong Kong Connection,"" a news program by the city's public broadcaster RTHK. The episode examined who was behind a mob attack on a group of protesters and commuters in a train station on July 21, 2019, that left 45 people injured, and why the police were slow to respond.",在她制作的纪录片中，有一集获奖的节目来自香港公共广播公司——香港电台的新闻节目《铿锵集》。这集节目调查了谁是2019年7月21日在地铁站对一群抗议者和通勤者发动暴徒袭击的幕后黑手以及为何警方反应迟缓，这起事件造成45人受伤。
"Ms. Choy had used a public database to look up the license plates of vehicles caught on video transporting the suspected attackers, and traced them to community leaders in Hong Kong's outlying villages. She was arrested in 2020 and found guilty the next year of making false statements to obtain car registry records. A court ordered her to pay a fine of 6,000 Hong Kong dollars, about $775. She later appealed the conviction.",摄像头捕捉到运送袭击嫌疑人的车辆，蔡玉玲使用公共数据库查找了车牌，并追踪到香港边远村庄的村代表。她于2020年被捕，并于次年因查车牌登记记录时作出虚假陈述而被判有罪。法院命令她支付6000港元的罚款，约合775美元。她后来对定罪提出上诉。
"On Monday, five judges from the Court of Final Appeal voted unanimously to overturn the conviction. They argued that Ms. Choy may not have knowingly made a false statement, given that many news media companies had filed similar applications for information. By convicting Ms. Choy on the basis of inferring that she had broken the law knowingly, ""substantial and grave injustice was done to her,"" the court said in the ruling.","周一，终审法院五名法官一致投票推翻原判。他们认为，鉴于许多新闻媒体公司已经提交了类似的信息申请，蔡玉玲可能并非故意做出虚假陈述。法院在裁决中表示，在推定蔡玉玲对违法行为明知故犯的基础上对她定罪，""对上诉人造成实质及严重的不公""。"
"In remarks to reporters outside court, Ms. Choy said that she was happy with the conclusion of a legal fight that had lasted 30 months.",蔡玉玲在法庭外对记者说，她对持续了30个月的法律斗争的结果感到高兴。
"""It seems I haven't felt happy about something in a long time,"" she said. ""Maybe a lot of people feel the same way. So let us all enjoy this moment of happiness.""","""好像很久没有遇到开心的事了，""她说。""也许很多人都有同感。让我们一起享受这个开心的时刻吧。"""
"Francis Lee, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the ruling was a hard-fought victory for Ms. Choy and was a validation of the rights of journalists.",香港中文大学新闻与传播学院教授李立峯说，这项裁决对蔡玉玲来说是一场艰苦的胜利，也是对记者权利的确认。
"""One might also say that journalists should not be charged for using the car plate registry for reporting purposes in the first place, and the victory came only because of the courage and persistence of Choy,"" he said.","他说:""有人可能会说，记者为进行报道而查车牌，本不应被起诉，而胜诉完全是因为蔡玉玲的勇气和坚持。"""
"The Hong Kong Journalists Association said Ms. Choy's efforts had helped ""defend the space the industry ought to have in searching public records. We deeply respect Ms. Choy's bravery in protecting press freedom through her actions.""","香港记者协会表示，蔡玉玲的努力帮助""捍卫了该行业在搜索公共记录方面应有的空间。我们对蔡玉玲以行动捍卫新闻自由的勇气深表敬意""。"
"Ms. Choy's conviction in 2021 had created a chilling effect on news outlets, Ronson Chan, the chairman of the journalists' group, said in an interview. But even with that conviction overturned, Mr. Chan noted, the city's journalists face severe constraints under a national security law Beijing imposed in 2020. That law makes it illegal to incite hatred toward the government, a vaguely defined offense that journalists risk running afoul of if their reports are critical of the authorities.",记者协会主席陈朗昇在接受采访时表示，蔡玉玲在2021年被定罪对新闻媒体产生了寒蝉效应。但陈朗昇指出，即使这一定罪被推翻，根据北京于2020年实施的国家安全法，该市的记者也面临着严格的限制。该法规定煽动对政府的仇恨是非法的，这是一种定义模糊的罪行，如果记者在报道中批评当局，有可能触犯这一罪行。
"The broader conditions for independent journalism remain challenging in Hong Kong, with laws criminalizing ""seditious publications."" Some of the city's most outspoken independent outlets haveshutteredfollowing raids. Editors and writers are facing long trials over their work.","在香港，独立新闻业的大环境仍然充满挑战，法律将""煽动性出版物""定为刑事犯罪。该市一些最直言不讳的独立媒体在遭到突击搜查后关闭。编辑和作者因他们的工作面临漫长的审判。"
"Ms. Choy co-founded an independent media outlet called The Collective HK in February, pledging to ""monitor the rich and powerful."" She was a recipient of the Nieman fellowship at Harvard University in 2022.","蔡玉玲于2月与他人共同创立了一家名为集志社(The Collective HK)的独立媒体机构，承诺""监督富人和权贵""。她是2022年哈佛大学尼曼奖学金的获得者。"
"""In recent years, we will find that a lot of things have disappeared without a word, but I believe that inner conviction is very hard to take away,"" she said on Monday.","""近几年，很多东西无声无息地消失了，但我相信内心的信念是很难被人拿走的，""她周一表示。"
"Karolyn Li still remembers reading the brochure from China's prestigious Tsinghua University when she was in high school preparing to apply to college. It highlighted a graduate who had co-founded an L.G.B.T.Q. rights group, a suggestion of inclusivity on campus that surprised Ms. Li, who identifies as queer.",卡罗琳·李还记得，她在高中准备申大学时看过中国顶尖学府清华大学的宣传册。里面提到了一位参与创立了某LGBTQ权利团体的毕业生，这种校园包容性的暗示让自我认同为酷儿的李女士感到惊讶。
"Ms. Li ended up enrolling at Tsinghua. Now a 21-year-old junior, Ms. Li sees the brochure as cruelly ironic. She and her friend, Christine Huang, a 23-year-old senior, have spent the past year locked in a losing battle against the university and the country's education authorities over gay and transgender expression.",李女士最终进入了清华大学。现在已经是21岁的大三学生的李女士认为，这本小册子极具讽刺意味。过去一年里，她和她的朋友、23岁的大四学生克莉丝汀·黄一直在与校方和国家教育部门就同性恋和跨性别表达问题进行一场毫无胜算的斗争。
"When the two women distributed rainbow flags on campus last year, and resisted school administrators who confronted them, the university issued a punishment that would stay on their permanent records. When they tried in March to place flowers outside the dorm of a transgender classmate who died by suicide, they were surrounded by security. When they posed with rainbow flags in a photo in May, a university employee ran over and said they were not allowed to post the images online.",去年，因在校园内分发彩虹旗，并反抗与她们对峙的学校管理人员，校方对两人做出了将被永久记录在案的处分。今年3月，她们试图在一名自杀身亡的跨性别同学的宿舍外留下鲜花，被保安包围。今年5月，她们与彩虹旗合影，一名大学工作人员跑过来说不允许将照片发布到网上。
"""All these things add up to make me wonder: How did things get so bad?"" said Ms. Huang, who identifies as a lesbian.","""这些事情加起来都让我觉得，事情怎么能变得那么糟啊?""自我认同为同性恋的黄女士说。"
"In late May, they were told by a court in Beijing, where Tsinghua is, that it would not accept a lawsuit they had filed against the country's education ministry to overturn the university's punishment over the flag incident.",5月下旬，清华所在城市北京的一家法院告知她们，法院不会受理她们对国家教育部提起的诉讼，她们在诉讼中要求大学取消对彩虹旗事件的处分。
"Ms. Huang and Ms. Li's experiences point to the shrinking space for even subtle gay and transgender expression in China. As the ruling Communist Party has tightened controls on ideology and civil society, nationalist commentators on social media have sought to depict Chinese L.G.B.T.Q. activist groups in particular as a tool of hostile foreign forces.",黄女士和李女士的经历表明，在中国，即使是隐晦的同性恋和跨性别表达，空间也在缩小。随着执政的共产党加强对意识形态和公民社会的控制，社交媒体上的民族主义评论员试图将中国的LGBTQ活动组织描绘成外国敌对势力的工具。
"Among the top accusations made against such groups is that they are ""causing conflict within society with the goal of destabilizing society,"" said Darius Longarino, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center.","耶鲁大学法学院蔡中曾中国中心高级研究员龙大瑞(Darius Longarino)说，针对这些团体的最主要指控是它们""在社会内部引发冲突，目的是破坏社会稳定""。"
"In May, the police in the eastern city of Hangzhou detained six gay men for 13 days for participating in what the report referred to as ""lewd activities,"" publicizing their names. That same month, Beijing LGBT Center, a well-known advocacy group, shut down after 15 years in operation, citing forces beyond its control.","5月，东部城市杭州警方将六名男同性恋者拘留了13天，通报称他们参与了""淫乱聚会""，公开了他们的姓名。同月，著名维权组织""北京同志中心""在运营15年后表示由于不可抗力终止运营。"
"The disbanding of the Beijing group crushed Ms. Huang, who had been a monthly donor to it. She said the center made people feel safe, citing a friend who had gone there for low-cost counseling.",北同中心的解散让每月给该组织捐款的黄女士受到打击。她说，这个中心让人们感到安全，并提到她的一位朋友在那里接受低费心理咨询。
"Civic groups in China have long navigated ill-defined and constantly shifting margins of official tolerance, with activists often facing the threat of arrest. Ms. Huang and Ms. Li were born in the early 2000s, a period when the authorities slightly loosened social controls. Homosexuality was removed from China's list of mental illnesses. Organizations like Shanghai Pride were able to host large public celebrations. Dozens of queer advocacy groups formed.",长期以来，中国的公民团体一直在官方容忍的范围内前行，而这个范围模糊不清且不断变化，活动人士经常面临被捕的威胁。黄女士和李女士出生于2000年代初期，那个时候当局略微放松了社会控制。同性恋被从中国的精神疾病名单中删除。上海骄傲节(ShanghaiPride)等组织能够举办大型公共庆祝活动，出现了数十个酷儿倡导团体。
"But under Xi Jinping, the top leader since 2012, the authorities have intensified a crackdown on human rights lawyers, feminist groups and other activists. Though Mr. Xi has not explicitly spoken about gay rights, he has emphasized Confucian values of order and obedience, in which citizens conform to traditional gender roles.",但在2012年以来担任最高领导人的习近平的领导下，当局加强了对人权律师、女权主义团体和其他活动人士的打压。尽管没有明确谈到同性恋权利，习近平强调了儒家关于秩序和服从的价值观，即公民要遵守传统的性别角色。
"In 2016, China banned television shows and films from showing gay characters. In 2020, Shanghai Pride announced an indefinite hiatus, alluding to safety concerns.",2016年，中国禁止电视节目和电影出现同性恋角色。2020年，上海骄傲节宣布无限期停办，并间接提到是出于安全担忧。
"In 2021, in what activists have described as a turning point, WeChat, the most popular app in China, suddenly deleted at least a dozen accounts of college-run L.G.B.T.Q. organizations.",2021年被活动人士称为一个转折点，中国最热门的应用程序微信突然删除了至少十几个大学运营的LGBTQ组织的账户。
"One of the accounts was run by Purple, a club of more than 300 members at Tsinghua that Ms. Huang and Ms. Li belonged to. All the articles its members had written about sex education, coming out to family, mental health vanished overnight.",其中一个账户由Purple运营，这是一个黄女士和李女士所在的社团，有300多名清华成员。它的成员写的所有文章——关于性教育、向家人出柜、心理健康——一夜之间都消失了。
"Ms. Huang tried to rally her brokenhearted friends. ""Although many things make people feel hopeless, we all have to keep living, and we have to be brave after this night,"" she texted them.","黄女士努力给伤心的朋友们鼓劲。""尽管很多事情让人感到没有希望，但是我们每个人都要活下去，这一夜后我们要勇敢起来，""她给大家发信息说。"
Ms. Huang and Ms. Li became friends after arriving at college from distant worlds. Ms. Li attended foreign-language schools in Wuhan in central China. She explored her gender identity in an environment where her classmates felt comfortable standing up and accusing a politics teacher of discrimination when he said homosexuality was an illness.,黄女士和李女士来自截然不同的世界，因为在同一所大学就读而成为朋友。李在中国中部的武汉市念外国语学校。她的同学敢于在政治课上站出来，指责声称同性恋是疾病的老师是在歧视，她就是在这样的环境里探索自己的性别身份的。
"Ms. Huang had a less privileged upbringing, raised largely by her grandmother in a small city in northeast China's Jilin Province. She realized she was a lesbian when she had a crush on a female TV character, but she was terrified to reveal this to most of her classmates.",黄的家境没有那么优越，她来自中国东北部吉林省一座小城市，童年大多数时间由祖母抚养。在发现自己迷上了电视上的一个女性角色时，她意识到自己是一个同性恋者，但是她不敢向绝大多数同学提及这件事。
"With their parents, Ms. Huang and Ms. Li almost always played the part of model daughters, obeying them and getting good grades. But in high school, they also had heated fights with their parents over whether they were gay, and have since avoided the coming-out conversation with them.",在父母面前，黄李二人基本上都保持着乖乖女的形象，听他们的话，学习成绩优秀。但是到了高中，她们和父母就她们是不是同性恋暴发激烈争吵，此后一直避免跟他们谈及出柜的话题。
"Both women came to Tsinghua wanting to be free. Purple became their core social circle, a gateway to a world of new ideas. The club hosted screenings of European films about gay labor activism and organized book clubs that discussed queer theory.",两人都希望来到清华后能得到自由。Purple成为她们的核心社交圈，一个通往许多新理念的入口。社团会放映讲同性恋劳工行动主义的欧洲电影，组织读书会讨论酷儿理论。
"The club gave them a sense of purpose. When a Purple member was at risk of contracting H.I.V., Ms. Huang helped him get off-campus testing. They tiptoed into activism, like giving flowers to the school's female employees for International Women's Day. To express their opposition to the invasion of Ukraine, they went out to eat stewed goose because in Chinese, the word for ""goose"" sounds like the word for ""Russia.""","Purple让她们有了一种抱负。一位会员有感染HIV的风险，黄女士帮助他到校外做了检测。他们小心翼翼地实践行动主义，比如在妇女节那天给校内的女性员工献花。为了表达对俄罗斯侵略乌克兰的反对，他们去吃了焖鹅煲——因为在中文里，""鹅""与""俄""同音。"
"Then, last year on May 14, before a pride day in China, they spread 10 rainbow flags on a table inside a supermarket on campus. ""Please take ~ #PRIDE,"" they scribbled on an accompanying note.","后来，在去年的5月14日——中国的一个同志骄傲日前夕，她们在校内一家超市的桌上摆了10面彩虹旗，旁边配有两行小字:""请自取~#PRIDE""。"
A surveillance camera caught them.,监控摄像头拍下了她们的举动。
"School officials barged into their dorms that night, the women said. The school later accused them of promoting a ""harmful influence,"" according to written decisions by the university explaining the punishment.","两人说，学校官员当晚闯进她们的寝室。在后来校方解释处分理由的书面文件中，她们被指造成""不良影响""。"
"The university asserted that the women had not sought permission to distribute the flags. It also accused Ms. Huang of using abusive and insulting language against university employees who had confronted her, and of sharing their names and job titles on WeChat. Ms. Huang acknowledged posting the names, but denied using abusive language. A representative for Tsinghua did not respond to requests for comment.",校方坚称两人分发旗帜前没有申请批准，并指责黄女士谩骂、侮辱与其对峙的校方工作人员，还在微信上分享了他们的姓名与职务。黄女士承认她公布了姓名，但否认有谩骂。清华大学的一名代表没有回应置评请求。
The punishment barred them from receiving scholarship money for six months and made it harder for them to apply to graduate school in China.,这项处分导致她们被停发六个月的奖学金，并增加了她们在中国报考研究生的难度。
"Ms. Li, a history major, is now looking to build a new life abroad, hoping to apply to graduate programs overseas.",主修历史的李女士现在试图去国外开启新的人生，并希望能攻读国外大学的研究生学位。
"Ms. Huang, a sociology major, recently drafted a letter to her parents revealing her sexual orientation. If the police knock on her parents' door, she plans to send a photo of the letter to them.",主修社会学的黄女士不久前写了一封给父母的信，向他们陈明她的性取向。万一警方找到她父母那里，她打算把这封信的照片发给他们。
"When Ms. Huang got into Tsinghua, it was the talk of her hometown, a dream come true for her family. Now, she is graduating next month with no job prospects. She had hoped to work at an L.G.B.T.Q. nonprofit, but knows her options are dwindling.",考上清华曾让黄女士成为家乡的话题人物，使她的家族梦想成真。如今再过一个月她就要毕业了，就业前景不妙。她希望在LGBTQ非营利组织工作，但她知道选择的余地正变得越来越小。
"In February, Ms. Huang and Ms. Li sued the education ministry because the legal system seemed the safest way to protest what happened to them.",2月，黄李二人状告教育部，因为通过司法系统来抗议她们的遭遇似乎是最安全的方式。
"After the lawsuit hung in limbo for three months, they visited the courthouse on May 24 with their lawyer, only to hear from a judge that the case would not be accepted. According to the women, the judge said there would be no written explanation, but cited a regulation prohibiting lawsuits that endanger national security or undermine national unity.",诉讼提交后三个月没有回音，于是她们于5月24日带着律师去了法院，结果从一位法官那里得知此案不会得到受理。据两人说，法官称不会做出书面解释，但提到有相关法规禁止受理危及国家安全或国家统一的诉讼。
"They plan to challenge the decision and exhaust all legal avenues to the end, even though they know the likely outcome.",她们打算对这一决定发起挑战，穷尽一切法律手段，尽管她们知道可能会是怎样的结果。
"""Even if the lawsuit cannot give us justice or recognition,"" Ms. Li said, ""we must record in documents that we existed, worked hard and fought.""","""哪怕这个法律无法给我们公正、无法给我们承认，""李女士说，""我们就必须以这种文书的形式去记录我们曾经存在过、努力过、抗争过。"""
"For decades, Hong Kong was the only place in China where the victims of the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy activists at Tiananmen Square in Beijing could be publicly mourned in a candlelight vigil. This year, Hong Kong is notable for all the ways it is being made to forget the 1989 massacre.","数十年来，香港曾是中国唯一能公开纪念""六四""的地方，人们用烛光守夜悼念1989年北京天安门广场民主运动中被军队镇压的罹难者。今年，香港以各种方式让人民忘记1989年大屠杀的做法引人注目。"
"In the days before the June 4 anniversary on Sunday, even small shops that displayed items alluding to the crackdown were closely monitored, receiving multiple visits from the police. Over the weekend, thousands of officers patrolled the streets in the Causeway Bay district, where the vigil was normally held, and set up tents where they searched people suspected of trying to mourn. They arrested four people accused of ""acts with seditious intention"" and detained four others.","今年的""六四""是周日，几天前，就连展示暗指镇压的物品的小商店也会受到严密监视，警方多次上门走访。周末，数千名警察在以前举行守夜活动的铜锣湾街头巡逻，还搭了临时帐篷，对涉嫌试图哀悼的人进行搜查。警察以涉嫌""作出具煽动意图的作为""逮捕了四人，并拘留了另外四人。"
"Zhou Fengsuo, a student leader in the Tiananmen Square protest movement, said that Hong Kong is now under the same ""despotic rule"" as the mainland.","天安门广场抗议运动的学生领袖周锋锁说，香港现在与内地一样处于""暴政""之下。"
"""Back in 1989, we did not realize the mission of a democratic China,"" said Mr. Zhou, now the executive director of Human Rights in China, a New York advocacy group. ""Afterward, Hong Kong protests faced the same suppression, the same vilification and erasure of memories.""","""我们在89年没有完成中国民主化的使命，""周锋锁说，他现任纽约倡导组织""中国人权""的执行主任。""到后来香港的抗遭遇到了同样的镇压，同样的污名化和抹去记忆的这个过程都是非常类似的。"""
"In 1989, the democracy movement in China drew huge support from Hong Kong, then a British colony. After the Chinese military cleared student protesters occupying Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds and possibly thousands, some student leaders in Beijing were smuggled to safety via Hong Kong.",1989年的那场民主运动在当时仍是英国殖民地的香港赢得大力支持。中国军队开枪打死了数百甚至数千人、清除了占领天安门广场的学生抗议者后，北京的一些学生领袖偷渡香港逃到了安全地方。
"Every June 4 for three decades, Victoria Park in Hong Kong was where Tiananmen Mothers, a group representing victims of the massacre, could openly grieve and express hopes for a freer China. The gatherings drew crowds of tens of thousands of people, even as in the past decade some of the city's younger generation of activists questioned the relevance of the mainland-focused movement as they embraced a distinct Hong Kong identity.","在那之后的三十多年里，代表大屠杀受害者的团体——""天安门母亲""曾于每年""六四""在香港的维多利亚公园举行公开的悼念活动，表达对一个更自由中国的希望。每年的烛光集会曾吸引成千上万的民众，尽管过去十年来，一些接受独特香港身份认同的年轻一代活动人士开始怀疑这场以内地为中心的运动是否具有相关性。"
"But since China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, virtually all forms of dissent have been criminalized in the city. Pro-democracy and antigovernment protests like those that roiled the city in 2019 have been snuffed out.",但自从中央政府2020年对香港实施国家安全法以来，几乎所有形式的异见在这座城市都成了犯罪。类似于2019年那场席卷香港的亲民主和反政府抗议活动已被扼杀。
"The authorities have paid particular attention to commemorations of the Tiananmen massacre. They raided a museum dedicated to it, removed books about the crackdown from libraries and imprisoned organizers of vigils.","当局对天安门大屠杀的纪念活动尤为关注。他们突击搜查了一个专门纪念""六四""的博物馆，从图书馆拿走了有关镇压的书籍，监禁了守夜活动的组织者。"
"In the past two years, the authorities cited pandemic restrictions to bar all public memorials of the crackdown. Those Covid restrictions were lifted this year, but instead of a Tiananmen vigil, Victoria Park was occupied by a trade fair. The fair was organized by pro-Beijing groups to celebrate the 1997 return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, one month before that anniversary.","过去两年里，当局曾以遏制疫情为由，禁止了所有公开纪念""六四""的活动。虽然今年取消了疫情限制，但维多利亚公园没有""六四""守夜活动，而是被一个市集占据。这个名为""家乡市集嘉年华""的活动是由亲北京的团体组织的，为的是庆祝1997年的香港回归，那个纪念日是在大约一个月后。"
The imprisonment of vigil organizers has raised the question of whether Hong Kong would ever allow residents to peacefully mourn the victims of the Tiananmen massacre.,"""六四""守夜活动组织者被监禁已引发了一个问题，即香港是否还允许民众和平地悼念天安门大屠杀的遇难者。"
"Hong Kong's chief executive, John Lee, has avoided providing a clear answer, saying only that ""everybody should act in accordance with the law and think of what they do, so as to be ready to face the consequences.""","香港行政长官李家超没有明确回答这个问题，只是说""每个人都应该依法行事，想想自己行动时是否有面对后果的准备""。"
"But the arrests on Saturday left little doubt. Among those arrested were Lau Ka-yee, of Tiananmen Mothers, and Kwan Chun-pong, a former vigil volunteer; they were carrying pieces of paper saying they were on a hunger strike as individual mourners. Sanmu Chan, a performance artist, yelled, ""Hong Kongers, don't be afraid! Don't forget June 4,"" as a crush of officers took him away. The police also detained a man and a woman who had carried chrysanthemums and worn white clothing, symbols of mourning.","但周六的逮捕已对这个问题做出了明确的回答。被捕者包括""天安门母亲""运动成员刘家仪和曾为守夜活动当义工的关振邦，他两人手里拿着写有以""禁食""方式做""个人悼念""的白纸。警方还逮捕了行为艺术家陈三木，他高呼""香港人，唔好惊""、""不忘六四""，一群警察向他扑来，将其带走。警方还拘留了一对手持菊花、身穿白色衣服的男女，菊花和白色衣服都象征哀悼。"
"A few more people were taken away by the police on Sunday, including Chan Po-ying, a labor activist; Mak Yin-ting, the former head of a journalist's association; and Alexandra Wong, better known as Grandma Wong, a familiar figure at many protests, often waving a British flag.","周日又有几人被警方带走，其中包括劳工维权人士陈宝莹、前香港记者协会主席麦燕庭，以及人称""王婆婆""的王凤瑶，许多抗议活动中经常有她挥舞着英国国旗的身影。"
"In the lead-up to the anniversary, the authorities were targeting the smallest gestures of remembrance.","在今年""六四""到来之前，当局就已经开始打击那些哪怕最微小的纪念姿态。"
"Debby Chan, a former pro-democracy district official, had posted a few photos on social media of electric candles she displayed in her grocery store last Tuesday. The police and representatives of three different government departments visited her several times because of that, she said. But she was undeterred.",曾任区议会议员的民主派人士陈嘉琳上周二在社交媒体上发了几张她在自家杂货店橱窗展示电蜡烛的照片。她说，警察和来自三个不同政府部门的人已因照片多次来到她店里。但她没有被吓倒。
"""The more we're not allowed to talk about it, the more they make these moves, the more I feel it is the right thing to do,"" she said in a phone interview.","""他们越是不让我们谈论'六四'，越是更多地采取这些做法，我就越觉得我这样做对，""她在接受电话采访时说。"
"To Lit Ming Wai, a playwright, Hong Kong has a responsibility to preserve and pass down the memory of the crackdown, especially as it has been distorted and then erased elsewhere in China.","剧作家列明慧认为，香港有责任保存和传承""六四""镇压的记忆，尤其是这一记忆已在中国其他地方被歪曲、被抹去的情况下。"
"In 2009, she co-founded a community theater group, Stage 64, which sought to make the history of June 4 more accessible for young people in Hong Kong. The troupe's most popular play is ""May 35th"" a euphemism for June 4 that some people on the mainland use to refer to the crackdown.","她曾在2009年与他人共同成立了社区剧团""六四舞台""，为的是让香港的年轻人以更通俗易懂的方式了解""六四""历史。该剧团最受欢迎的剧目是舞台剧《5月35日》，中国大陆的一些人用这个委婉的说法来指代镇压行动。"
"""When we talk about June 4, we are not just thinking about Tiananmen Mothers. Even more, we are thinking of Hong Kong,"" said Ms. Lit, who was an M.C. at June 4 vigils from 2004 to 2014.","""我们谈论'六四'时，想到的不只是天安门母亲。更重要的是，我们也在想香港，""列明慧说道。在2004年到2014年的""六四""守夜活动上，她曾担任主持人。"
"That play can no longer be performed in Hong Kong without risking prosecution. Now based in England, Ms. Lit is seeking to take the play overseas. The play was originally performed in Cantonese and had its Mandarin debut in Taipei, Taiwan, on Friday.",那部舞台剧已不能再在香港上演，否则将面临起诉风险。列明慧现居英国，她正在设法将这部剧带到海外。该剧最初以粤语演出，上周五在台北首次以国语演出。
"""For us Tiananmen survivors, losing Hong Kong this very important place that shielded history and truth is very painful,"" said Mr. Zhou, the former Tiananmen leader. After the raid and forced closing of a June 4 museum in Hong Kong in 2021, Mr. Zhou donated several Tiananmen artifacts to a newly established permanent exhibit in New York, including a bloodstained banner, a tent and a mimeograph. A section was devoted to Hong Kong.","""对于我们'六四'幸存者来讲， 失去香港这样一个最重要的失去香港这样一个最重要的保护历史真相的阵地真的是非常令人痛心的，""天安门抗议运动的学生领袖周锋锁说。2021年，香港的""六四""博物馆遭突袭搜查并被迫关闭后，周锋锁将几件天安门文物赠给了纽约新设立的永久性展览，包括一面血迹斑斑的横幅、一顶帐篷和一台油印机。该展览有一个专为香港设立的展室。"
"He added that he related to the wave of Hong Kong dissidents who had left the city to the pain of exile and their struggle to keep the movement alive while far from home. But their presence abroad was helping to keep the memory of the crackdown alive elsewhere, he said.","周锋锁还说，他理解并同情已经离开香港的一波波异见人士，理解他们流亡的痛苦，以及他们在远离家乡的地方保持运动活力的艰难。虽然他们身在国外，但他们对将""六四""镇压的记忆在其他地方保持下去有帮助，他说。"
"""On the other hand, many Hong Kongers are now passionately participating in June 4 activities around the world, increasing attendance threefold in some places,"" he said. ""There are now many cities that are starting to commemorate June 4 because of the arrival of Hong Kongers.""","""从另外一方面(来看)啊，各地去年都非常明显地看到有新到海外的香港人，他们会热切地加入各地纪念'六四'的活动，很多地方人数都(增加了)三倍以上，""他说。""也有很多城市就是因为香港人的到来(才)开始纪念'六四'。"""
"China's intelligence agencies are investing deeply in open-source intelligence to learn more about the capabilities of the American military in the Pacific and beyond, according to a new report.",一份新报告称，中国的情报机构正在大力投资开源情报，以更多地了解美军在太平洋及其他地区的能力。
"The analysis, by the threat intelligence company Recorded Future, details efforts by China's government and companies to collect publicly available data from the Pentagon, think tanks and private firms information Beijing's military can use to help plan for a potential conflict with the United States.",该分析报告来自一家名为Recorded Future的威胁情报公司，它详细说明了中国政府和企业从五角大楼、智库和私营公司收集公开数据的努力——北京军方可以利用这些信息来帮助为与美国的潜在冲突做规划。
Why It Matters: Beijing's open-source intelligence collection could give it an advantage.,为什么这很重要:北京收集开源情报可以给它带来优势。
"As the relationship between the United States and China has become more adversarial, both countries are investing more in their intelligence collection capabilities.",在美中对抗加剧之际，两国都在加大对情报收集能力的投入。
"With Beijing's investments in big data management, mining publicly available sources of information could give China an advantage in collecting intelligence on the United States and its allies.",随着北京对大数据管理的投资，挖掘公开的信息来源可以使中国在收集美国及其盟友的情报方面占据优势。
"While autocratic countries like China hide information about their military, the United States as a democracy that tries to be responsive to its public puts out a plethora of information about its military capabilities, doctrine and planning.",虽然像中国这样的专制国家隐藏了自己军队的信息，但美国作为一个试图对公众做出快速回应的民主国家，发布了大量关于其军事能力、理论和计划的信息。
"China can mine that information, looking for material it can use to its own military advantages. For example, the report details some of the work one prominent Chinese open-source intelligence company has done to analyze publicly available insights from the Office of Net Assessment, the Pentagon's in-house think tank. Recorded Future also outlined how China has tried to gather information put out by the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.","中国可以挖掘这些信息，寻找可用于自身军事优势的材料。例如，该报告详细介绍了一家主要的中国开源情报公司所做的一些工作，以分析来自五角大楼内部智囊团""网络评估办公室""可公开获得的观点分析。Recorded Future还概述了中国如何试图收集位于罗得岛纽波特的海军战争学院发布的信息。"
"""The U.S. Naval War College has a China Maritime Studies Institute, and it produces a lot of open-source research on China,"" said Zoe Haver, a threat intelligence analyst with Recorded Future. ""This is done in an academic setting, but ultimately foreign governments consider this valuable intelligence.""","""美国海军战争学院有一个中国海事研究所，它开展了大量关于中国的开源研究，""Recorded Future的威胁情报分析师佐伊·哈弗说。""这是在学术环境中完成的，但终究会被外国政府认定为有价值的情报。"""
Military officials did not immediately comment on the report's findings.,军方官员没有立即对报告的结论置评。
Background: China is mining information on the U.S. military.,背景:中国正在挖掘有关美军的信息。
"China's secret intelligence-gathering abilities have grown in leaps and bounds in recent decades, and Beijing's investment in open-source information has intensified over the last decade.",近几十年来，中国收集秘密情报的能力突飞猛进，北京方面在过去十年加大了对开源信息的投入。
"The definition of open-source intelligence is broad, but Recorded Future looked at information that the intelligence agencies of China's People's Liberation Army were using to help them make plans and develop themilitary.",开源情报的定义很广泛，但Recorded Future研究了中国人民解放军的情报机构用来帮助他们制定计划和发展军事的信息。
"Recorded Future has examined contracts that the army has issued to private Chinese companies to gather a range of open-source information, including material about the U.S. military and its work on the defense of Taiwan.",Recorded Future对军方签发给中国民营公司的合同展开了调查，让它们收集一系列开源信息，包括有关美军及其在台湾防卫工作的材料。
"""The P.L.A. very much assumes the United States will in some form intervene in a Taiwan conflict, and they work very hard to prepare for that type of scenario,"" Ms. Haver said.","""解放军在很大程度上假设美国会以某种形式干预台湾冲突，他们非常努力地为这种情况做准备，""哈弗说。"
"Much of what Beijing is mining from open-source data may well be available in one Chinese spy agency or another. But China's intelligence agencies are walled off from one another and do not share information, according to Recorded Future's analysts. And it may be easier for parts of the P.L.A.'sintelligence arms to develop open-source information about American capabilities than to request classified information from a sister spy agency.",北京从开源数据中挖掘的大部分内容很可能都掌握在个别中国间谍机构手中。但据Recorded Future的分析师称，中国的情报机构各自为政，不会共享信息。与向姊妹间谍机构索取机密信息相比，对于解放军部分情报机构来说，开发有关美国能力的公开来源信息可能更容易。
What's Next: Open-source collection presents a challenge for democracies.,下一步:收集开源信息对民主国家构成挑战。
"Recorded Future acknowledges there are security concerns given the information the United States and its allies make public, but cutting off broad access to the data may not be the answer.",考虑到美国及其盟国公开的信息，Recorded Future承认存在安全问题，但切断对数据的广泛访问可能不是解决办法。
"Instead, Ms. Haver said Recorded Future hoped awareness of Chinese open-source intelligence gathering would help private-sector companies, the military and other government agencies better manage that risk and make it harder for automatic web crawlers to scrape information from public databases or websites. She also encouraged private companies to conduct due diligence about Chinese firms trying to purchase access to their information.",相反，哈弗说，Recorded Future希望人们意识到中国对开源情报的收集，这将有助于私营部门公司、军方和其他政府机构更好地管理这种风险，并使自动网络爬虫更难从公共数据库或网站上抓取信息。她还鼓励私营公司对试图购买其信息的中国公司进行尽职调查。
"""At the end of the day, we don't expect Western countries to close off their information environments,"" Ms. Haversaid. ""That would not even be a good thing. We value openness.""","""归根结底，我们不希望西方国家关闭他们的信息环境，""哈弗说。""那甚至不是一件好事。我们重视开放。"""
"For a few weeks, a flurry of meetings between American and Chinese officials seemed to signal that the two countries were trying to reduce tensions, after months of rancor and frozen high-level contacts raised concerns about the risk of a conflict, accidental or otherwise.",几周来，美中官员频繁会晤，似乎表明两国正在努力缓和紧张关系。这之前，中美互相埋怨、停止高层接触已有几个月，引发了人们对于发生冲突风险的担忧——无论冲突是出于意外还是其他原因导致。
"First the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met with China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, in Vienna, in May. Then the two countries' top commerce officials held talks, the first bilateral cabinet-level meeting in Washington in months. China's ambassador also arrived in Washington last week, finally filling a post that had been vacant since January.",最早是美国国家安全顾问沙利文今年5月在维也纳与中国级别最高外交官王毅见面。然后是两国最高商务官员在华盛顿举行几个月来的首次内阁级双边会谈。中国驻美国大使也在上周抵达华盛顿，终于填补了自今年1月以来一直空缺的职位。
"But even as Beijing has returned to the table on some issues, it has also struck an even tougher posture, complicating the ""thaw"" in U.S.-China relations that President Biden had predicted last month. China has questioned Washington's sincerity, pushed back on U.S. tech export controls by imposing its own restrictions and demanded the dropping of sanctions.","但北京在一些问题上重返谈判桌的同时，中国政府也拿出了一种更加强硬的姿态，让拜登总统上个月预测的美中关系""解冻""变得更加复杂。中国对华盛顿的诚意表示怀疑，并已通过采取自己的限制措施来回击美国的技术出口管制，还要求美国取消对中国官员的制裁。"
"Beijing rejected an invitation for China's defense minister, Li Shangfu, to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at a security meeting this weekend in Singapore, the Pentagon said this week. And last Friday, a Chinese jet buzzed an American spy plane over the South China Sea and flew directly in front of the plane's nose, a maneuver the U.S. military called ""unnecessarily aggressive.""","五角大楼本周表示，北京拒绝了美方提出的让中国国防部长李尚福与美国国防部长劳埃德·奥斯汀本周末在新加坡的安全会议上会晤的邀请。上周五，一架中国战斗机在南中国海上空逼近一架美国侦察机，从美国飞机的机头前直接掠过，美国军方将这一行动描述为""不必要得好斗""。"
"""China tends to look at access to its senior leaders as a reward for acquiescence, rather than a tool for creating stability or resolving differences,"" said Drew Thompson, a former U.S. defense official who is currently a fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. ""You have to meet China on their terms in order to get a meeting.""","""中国往往把接触它的高级领导人视为对顺从的奖励，而不是创造稳定或解决分歧的工具，""曾在美国国防部担任中国问题官员的唐安竹(Drew Thompson)说，他现在是新加坡国立大学李光耀公共政策学院的研究员。""想安排见面，就必须接受中国的条件。"""
"The Pentagon called China's rejection of the meeting at this week's Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore an example of Beijing's ""concerning"" unwillingness to engage on military issues. Mr. Li, who was appointed to his position in March, has been under U.S. sanctions since 2018 over the purchase of military equipment from Russia. Pentagon officials have said these do not prevent Mr. Li from meeting Mr. Austin.","五角大楼称，中国拒绝让两国防长本周在新加坡举行的香格里拉对话会上见面，是北京不愿就军事问题进行接触的一个""令人担忧的""例子。李尚福今年3月出任国防部长，自2018年以来，他因为从俄罗斯购买军事装备而一直受到美方制裁。五角大楼官员表示，这些制裁并不妨碍李尚福与奥斯汀会晤。"
"But China has argued that sanctions against Chinese officials are an obstacle to improving the relationship. Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, said Washington should lift the sanctions against Mr. Li and ""create favorable conditions for dialogue."" On Tuesday, she reiterated China's position that Washington should ""immediately correct wrong practices"" if it wants to restore communication between the militaries.","但中国认为，制裁中国官员有碍两国关系的改善。中国外交部发言人毛宁称，华盛顿应该解除对李尚福的制裁，""为中美两军对话沟通创造必要的氛围和条件""。她周二重申了中国的立场，如果华盛顿想恢复两军对话，就应该""立即纠正错误做法""。"
"China wants to meet with U.S. officials without what it sees as demeaning circumstances, said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai.",上海复旦大学国际关系学教授沈丁立表示，中国不想在其认为有失尊严的情况下与美国官员见面。
"""We want to have a meeting based on mutual respect,"" Professor Shen said. ""We want the U.S. to lift the sanctions and to seek a compromise by mutual concession.""","""我们要在相互尊重的基础上举行会晤，""沈丁立说。""我们希望美方解除制裁，通过相互让步寻求妥协。"""
"In recent years, the U.S. has sanctioned Chinese officials and companies over allegations of human rights abuses, tech espionage and a range of other issues.",近年来，美国对一些中国官员和公司实施制裁，指控他们侵犯人权、从事技术间谍活动，以及一系列其他问题。
"The U.S. and China have incentive to seek a steadier footing ahead of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in November in San Francisco, which will be closely watched for any meeting between Mr. Biden and China's leader, Xi Jinping. Though both governments have said they want to arrest the downward spiral in relations that was set off in February when the U.S. downed a suspected Chinese spy balloon, their motives for doing so are not always aligned.",亚太经济合作组织年度论坛将于今年11月在旧金山举行，人们将密切关注拜登与中国领导人习近平是否会在论坛期间见面，因此美中都有动力在论坛召开前为双方关系寻求更稳定的基础。尽管两国政府都已表示希望停止双方关系的螺旋式下降，(今年2月美国击落了一个疑似中国间谍气球的飞行物，导致关系恶化)，但双方改善关系的动机并不总一致。
"U.S. officials want open lines of military communication with China. As the jet interception last week showed, the two countries' militaries regularly patrol disputed areas such as the South China Sea, heightening the risk of an unintentional conflict. On Thursday, Mr. Austin said some of China's activities in international airspace and waterways were ""provocative."" (Beijing, for its part, blamed the United States for deploying aircraft and vessels too close to Chinese borders.)","美国官员想与中国建立通畅的军方沟通渠道。正如上周的军机拦截事件所显示的，两国军队经常在有争议地区(如南中国海)巡逻，增加了发生意外冲突的风险。奥斯汀周四表示，中国在国际空域和水域的一些活动具有""挑衅性""。(北京则指责美国飞机和船只的活动地点距离中国边境太近。)"
"Mr. Biden has talked about erecting ""guardrails"" to prevent U.S.-China competition from veering into a crisis. But Chinese officials have rejected that suggestion as an effort by Washington to contain and suppress China's rise.","拜登建议设立""护栏""，防止美中竞争突然转向危机。但中国官员拒绝了这一建议，认为那是华盛顿遏制和打压中国崛起的努力。"
"""In the absence of dialogue, there are unacceptable risks to both sides,"" said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. That includes, she said, the risk of ""sleepwalking into a conflict over Taiwan.""","""不进行对话给双方都带来不可接受的风险，""美国的德国马歇尔基金会亚洲项目主任葛来仪(Bonnie Glaser)说，包括""在台湾问题上稀里糊涂陷入冲突""的风险。"
"The U.S. also sees the potential for deeper cooperation with China on issues like mitigating climate change and relieving debt in poor countries, arenas where the two rivals are more likely to find common ground than in sensitive military and security issues.",美国也在减缓气候变化和减轻贫穷国家债务等问题上看到与中国进行更深入合作的潜力，这两个竞争对手在这些领域更有可能找到共同点，而非敏感的军事和安全领域。
"John Kerry, Mr. Biden's climate envoy, said last month that China invited him to visit in the ""near term."" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said in April that she hopes to visit China, calling for a ""constructive"" and ""healthy"" economic relationship.","拜登的气候特使克里上月表示，中国已邀请他""近期""访问。财政部长耶伦也曾在今年4月表示，她希望访问中国，并呼吁建立""建设性""和""健康""的经济关系。"
"For China, restarting trade talks with the U.S. could help revive the domestic economy. China's recovery this year, after three years of strict ""zero Covid"" restrictions, has been uneven, and growth in exports has slowed. Geopolitical tensions, as well as China's focus on national security, have created an uncertain business environment.","对中国来说，重启与美国的贸易谈判能帮助国内的经济复苏。实行了三年严格的""新冠清零""政策后，中国今年的经济复苏并不均衡，出口增长已有所放缓。地缘政治紧张局势，加上政府把注意力放在国家安全上，导致了一个不确定的商业环境。"
"""We want to talk about how we can export to the U.S. without hurting U.S. national security, and how the U.S. can access the Chinese market while respecting China,"" said Professor Shen of Fudan University.","""我们想讨论的是，如何在不损害美国国家安全的情况下向美国出口，以及美国如何在尊重中国的情况下进入中国市场，""复旦大学的沈丁立说。"

"On Tuesday, China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, used a meeting with Mr. Musk to convey Beijing's talking points that a ""healthy, stable and constructive"" relationship between the U.S. and China benefited both countries, and the world. Mr. Qin said the two countries needed to know when to ""step on the brakes"" to ""avoid dangerous driving,"" and when to ""step on the gas pedal"" to promote cooperation.","周二，中国外交部长秦刚与马斯克见面时传达了中国政府的观点，那就是""健康、稳定、建设性""的中美关系对两国和世界有利。秦刚说，两国在发展好关系上需要知道何时""踩刹车""，避免""危险驾驶""，何时""踩油门""。"
"China may also feel pressure to engage with the U.S. to push back against sweeping restrictions announced by the Biden administration in October to block Beijing's access to critical U.S. technologies, such as semiconductors. China is incensed by Washington's efforts to rally allies like Japan and the Netherlands to similarly cut off chip exports to China, moves that have hurt the Chinese economy.",拜登政府去年10月份宣布了阻止中国获得美国关键技术(如半导体)的全面限制措施，中国为抵制这些措施，也可能感受到了与美国接触的压力。中国对华盛顿动员日本和荷兰等盟友一起切断向中国出口芯片的努力感到愤怒，美国的做法已损害了中国经济。
"In what analysts saw as a retaliatory move, the Chinese government last week announced a ban on certain companies buying products from Micron Technology, a U.S.-based microchip manufacturer.",中国政府上周宣布禁止某些公司购买美国微芯片制造商美光科技的产品，这在分析人士看来是一种报复行为。
"""When China talks about finding stability in the relationship, it's often more about getting the U.S. to relieve strategic pressure on China,"" said Paul Haenle, a former director for China on the National Security Council under the Bush and Obama administrations. ""They want the U.S. to stop with the sanctions, stop with the export controls.""","""中国谈寻求稳定关系时，往往更多的是让美国减轻对中国的战略压力，""曾在布什政府和奥巴马政府担任国家安全委员会中国事务主任的韩磊(Paul Haenle)说。""他们想让美国停止制裁，取消出口管制。"""
"Even with talks restarted, some issues may be difficult or impossible to resolve. Washington has repeatedly warned of consequences if China provides lethal aid to Russia, Beijing's close strategic partner, in Moscow's war in Ukraine. Bipartisan political moves in the U.S. to confront China could limit the space for Biden administration efforts at rapprochement, analysts say.",即使重启谈判，一些问题也可能很难或无法解决。华盛顿已一再警告，如果中国向其亲密战略伙伴俄罗斯提供用于乌克兰战争的致命武器，将会导致严重后果。分析人士说，对抗中国的两党政治行动可能会限制拜登政府和解努力的空间。
"In a commentary last week, People's Daily, the main newspaper of the Communist Party, said Ambassador Xie Feng's arrival in Washington on May 23 was ""a sign of detente that is pulling the strained relationship from the brink.""","中共主要报纸《人民日报》在上周发表的一篇评论文章称，谢锋大使5月23日抵达华盛顿，""将紧张关系从悬崖边上拉回来，让中美关系出现了缓和迹象""。"

"China's young people are facing record-high unemployment as the country's recovery from the pandemic is fluttering. They're struggling professionally and emotionally. Yet the Communist Party and the country's top leader, Xi Jinping, are telling them to stop thinking they are above doing manual work or moving to the countryside. They should learn to ""eat bitterness,"" Mr. Xi instructed, using a colloquial expression that means to endure hardships.","随着中国跌跌撞撞地走出疫情，该国的年轻人正面临创纪录的高失业率。无论是在职业上还是精神上，他们都处于挣扎中。然而，共产党和国家最高领导人习近平告诉他们，不要再觉得自己不能从事体力劳动或不能到农村去。习近平指示他们，应该学会""吃苦""。"
"Many young Chinese aren't buying it. They argue that they studied hard to get a college or graduate school degree only to find a shrinking job market, falling pay scale and longer work hours. Now the government is telling them to put up with hardships. But for what?",许多年轻人对此并不买账。他们认为，自己通过刻苦学习拿到了本科或研究生学位，却发现就业市场萎缩、薪资水平下降和工作时间延长。现在政府还叫他们吃苦。为什么?
"""Asking us to eat bitterness is like a deception, a way of hoping that we will unconditionally dedicate ourselves and undertake tasks that they themselves are unwilling to do,"" Ms. Li said.","""我觉得叫我们吃苦就像骗你一样，就是希望你无条件地去奉献，然后去做一些他们都不愿意做的苦差事，""格洛丽亚·李说。"
People like Ms. Li were lectured by their parents and teachers about the virtues of hardship. Now they are hearing it from the head of state.,父母和老师爱教育格洛丽亚·李这样的人吃苦是美德。现在还要听国家领导人这样说。
"""The countless instances of success in life demonstrate that in one's youth, choosing to eat bitterness is also choosing to reap rewards,"" Mr. Xi was quoted in a front-page article in the official People's Daily on the Youth Day in May.","""无数人生成功的事实表明，青年时代，选择吃苦也就选择了收获，""官方报纸《人民日报》五一青年节头版文章引用习近平的话说。"

He has also repeatedly urged young people to ""seek self-inflicted hardships,"" using his own experience of working in the countryside during the Cultural Revolution.","这篇关于习近平对年轻一代期望的文章，五次提到""吃苦""。他还以自己在""文革""期间下乡的经历，反复呼吁年轻人""自找苦吃""。"

"A record 11.6 million college graduates are entering the work force this year, and one in five young people is unemployed. China's leadership is hoping to persuade a generation that grew up amid mostly rising prosperity to accept a different reality.",今年进入劳动力市场的大学毕业生有1160万，创下历史纪录，每五个年轻人当中就有一人失业。这一代人在日益繁荣的环境中成长起来，而中国领导人希望说服他们接受一个不同的现实。
"The youth unemployment rate is a statistic the Chinese Communist Party takes seriously because it believes that idle young people could threaten its rule. Mao Zedong sent more than 16 million urban youths, including Mr. Xi, to toil in the fields of the countryside during the Cultural Revolution. The return of these jobless young people to cities after the Cultural Revolution, in part, forced the party to embrace self-employment, or jobs outside the state planned economy.",青年失业率是中共非常重视的一个统计数据，因为它认为赋闲的年轻人可能会威胁到它的统治。文化大革命期间，毛泽东将包括习近平在内的逾1600万城市青年送去下乡。文化大革命后这些失业的年轻人返城，在一定程度上迫使该党接受个体经营或国家计划经济之外的工作。
"Today the party's propaganda machine is spinning stories about young people making a decent living by delivering meals, recycling garbage, setting up food stalls, and fishing and farming. It's a form of official gaslighting, trying to deflect accountability from the government for its economy-crushing policies like cracking down on the private sector, imposing unnecessarily harsh Covid restrictions and isolating China's trading partners.","今天，党的宣传机器正在炮制年轻人靠送餐、回收垃圾、摆小吃摊、打鱼种田过上体面生活的故事。这是官方的""煤气灯操纵""(一种心理操控手段，使受害者产生认知失调，质疑自己的感知力或判断力——译注)，试图转移政府政策破坏经济的责任，这些政策包括打击民营部门、施加不必要的严厉的防疫措施，以及孤立中国的贸易伙伴。"
"Many people are struggling emotionally. A young woman in Shanghai named Ms. Zhang, who graduated last year with a master's degree in city planning, has sent out 130 resumes and secured no job offers and only a handful of interviews. Living in a 100-square-foot bedroom in a three-bedroom apartment, she barely gets by with a monthly income of less than $700 as a part-time tutor.",许多人在精神上也存在挣扎。上海的张女士去年毕业并获得城市规划硕士学位，她投了130份简历，但没有获得任何工作机会，只拿到少数面试机会。她租住在一套三居室的九平米卧室里，以兼职家教为生，不到5000元的收入仅勉强糊口。
"""At my emotional low point, I wished I were a robot,"" she said. ""I thought to myself if I didn't have emotions, I would not feel helpless, powerless and disappointed. I would be able to keep sending out resumes.""","""前段时间情绪很糟的时候，我想如果我是一个机器人，""她说，""没有感情的机器人，我不会感到无助，我不会感到无力，我不会感到沮丧、失望的话，我就会一直投一直投。"""
But she realized she shouldn't be too harsh on herself. The problems are bigger than her. She doesn't buy into the eating bitterness talk.,但她意识到不应该对自己太苛刻。问题超出了她的解决范围。她不相信吃苦那一套。
"""To ask us to endure hardships is to try to shift focus from the anemic economic growth and the decreasing job opportunities,"" said Ms. Zhang, who, like most people I interviewed for this column, wanted to be identified with only her family name because of safety concerns. A few others want to be identified only with their English names.","""叫我们吃苦就是要去掩盖当下国内的经济发展动力不足、就业岗位减少的情况，""她说。和我为本专栏采访的大多数人一样，出于安全考虑，她希望只透露自己的姓氏。还有一些人希望只用自己的英文名。"
"The party's messaging is effective with some people. Guo, a data analyst in Shanghai who has been unemployed since last summer, said he didn't want to blame his joblessness on the pandemic or the Communist Party. He blames his own lack of luck and abilities.",党传递的信息对一些人是有效的。郭是上海的一名数据分析师，自去年夏天以来一直没有工作，他说他不想把自己的失业归咎于疫情或共产党。他责怪自己缺乏运气和能力。
"He canceled his online games and music subscriptions. To make ends meet, he delivered meals last December, working 11 to 12 hours a day. In the end he made a little over $700 a month. He quit because the work was too physically exhausting.",他取消了网络游戏和音乐的订阅。为了维持生计，他从去年12月开始送外卖，每天工作11到12个小时。最后，他一个月下来刚挣了5000元多一点。他辞职了，因为那工作太累了。
"In other words, he failed in eating bitterness.",换句话说，他吃不了苦。
"Mr. Xi's instruction to move to the countryside is equally out of touch with young people, as well as with China's reality. In December he told officials ""to systematically guide college graduates to rural areas."" On Youth Day a few weeks ago, he responded to a letter by a group of agriculture students who are working in rural areas, commending them for ""seeking self-inflicted hardships."" The letter, also published on the front page of People's Daily, triggered discussions about whether Mr. Xi would start a Maoist-style campaign to send urban youths to the countryside.","习近平关于下乡的指示不仅与年轻人脱节，也和中国的现实脱节。12月，他告诉官员们""要有序引导大学毕业生到乡""。几周前的青年节，他回复了一群在农村地区工作的农业学生的信，赞扬他们""自找苦吃""。这封信发表在《人民日报》的头版上，引发了关于习近平是否会发起一场毛泽东式的运动，将城市青年送往农村的讨论。"
Such a policy would devastate the Chinese dream of moving up socially that many young people and their parents hold dearly.,这样的政策将摧毁许多年轻人及其父母所珍视的中国梦，即社会地位的提升。
"Wang, a former advertising executive in Kunming in southwestern China, has been unemployed since December 2021 after the pandemic hit his industry hard.

He said they were vehemently against the idea.",王是中国西南部昆明的一名前广告高管，自2021年12月疫情对他所在的行业造成严重打击以来，他一直处于失业状态。他跟身为农民的父母谈起想回老家办养猪场。他说父母强烈反对这个想法。
"""They said they spent a lot of money on my education so I wouldn't become a farmer,"" he said.","""他们说他们花了那么多的钱给我学习，就是为了让我不做农民，""他说。"
"In the hierarchical Chinese society, manual jobs are looked down upon. Farming ranks even lower because of the huge wealth gap between cities and rural areas.",在等级森严的中国社会，体力劳动受到轻视。由于城乡之间巨大的贫富差距，农业的地位甚至更低。
"""Women wouldn't consider to become my girlfriends if they knew that I deliver meals,"" Wang said. He would fare even worse in the marriage market if he became a farmer.","""去找女朋友，人家一听说你是送外卖的肯定就不考虑了，""他说。如果当农民的话，他在婚姻市场上的处境会更糟。"
It's obvious to some young people that Mr. Xi's proposals for solving unemployment are backward looking.,对一些年轻人来说，很明显，习近平解决失业问题的建议是一种倒退。
"Mr. Xi ""talks about the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation all the time,"" said Steven, who graduated from a top U.K. university with a master's degree in interactive design and has yet to find a job. ""But isn't the rejuvenation about not everyone engaging in physical labor?""

"Of 13 Chinese graduates from his school, the five who chose to stay in the West have found jobs at Silicon Valley or Wall Street firms. Only three of the eight who returned to China have secured job offers. Steven moved back to China this year to be closer to his mother.",他所在学校的13名中国毕业生中，有五人选择留在西方，在硅谷或华尔街的公司找到了工作。回国的八人中只有三人获得了工作机会。史蒂文今年搬回中国，以便离母亲更近一些。
"Now after months of fruitless job hunting, he, like almost every young worker I interviewed for this column, sees no future for himself in China.",经过几个月徒劳无果的求职，他和我为这个专栏采访的几乎所有年轻工作者一样，认为自己在中国没有前途。

The bidding for Lot 17 started at $23 million.,17号拍卖品的起价是2300万美元。
"In the packed room at Sotheby's in Manhattan, the price quickly climbed: $32 million, $42 million, $48 million. Then a new prospective buyer, calling from China, made it a contest between just two people.",在挤满人的曼哈顿苏富比拍卖行，报价迅速攀升:3200万美元、4200万美元、4800万美元。后来，一名从中国打电话来参拍的潜在新买家将这场竞价变成了两个人的较量。
"On the block that evening in November 2014 were works by Impressionist painters and Modernist sculptors that would make the auction the mostsuccessful yet in the firm's history. But one painting drew particular attention: ""Still Life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies,"" completed by Vincent van Gogh weeks before his death.","2014年11月那场""印象派及现代艺术""晚间拍卖会后来成了苏富比截至当时史上最成功的一场拍卖。拍卖会上尤其引人瞩目的一幅画作是文森特·梵高在去世几周前完成的静物画《雏菊与罂粟花》。"
"Pushing the price to almost $62 million, the Chinese caller prevailed. His offer was the highest ever for a van Gogh still life at auction.",从中国打电话来参拍的人将出价提高到近6200万美元(人民币3.77亿元)后获胜。他的出价是梵高静物画作拍卖历史上的最高价格。
"In the discreet world of high-end art, buyers often remain anonymous. But the winning bidder, a prominent movie producer, would proclaim in interview after interview that he was the painting's new owner.",在谨慎的高端艺术品世界中，买家通常保持匿名。但在那次竞拍中获胜的著名电影制片人在后来的一次又一次采访中宣称，他就是那幅画的新主人。
"The producer, Wang Zhongjun, was on a roll. His company had just helped bring ""Fury,"" the World War II movie starring Brad Pitt, to cinemas. He dreamed of making his business China's version of the Walt Disney Company.","制片人王中军当时鸿运当头。他的公司刚刚帮助把布拉德·皮特主演的""二战""题材电影《狂怒》送进中国的院线。他梦想着把自己的企业打造成中国版的华特迪士尼公司。"
"The sale, according to Chinese media, became a national ""sensation."" It was a sign after the acquisition of a Picasso by a Chinese real estate tycoon the year before that the country was becoming a force in the global art market.","据中国媒体报道，那笔交易""轰动""了全国。它当时是中国正在成为全球艺术市场主力军的又一迹象。一名中国房地产大亨曾在一年前拍下了一幅毕加索画作。"
"""Ten years ago, I could not have imagined purchasing a van Gogh,"" Mr. Wang said in a Chinese-language interview with Sotheby's. ""After buying it, I loved it so much.""","""十年前怎么可能想去买梵高?""王中军在接受苏富比拍卖行的中文采访时说。""买完梵高的作品后，我这么喜欢。"""
"But Mr. Wang may not be the real owner at all. Two other men were linked to the purchase: an obscure middleman in Shanghai who paid Sotheby's bill through a Caribbean shell company, and the person he answered to a reclusive billionaire in Hong Kong.",但王中军可能根本就不是那幅画的真正主人。另有两名男子与那笔交易有关:一名是通过一家加勒比空壳公司支付了苏富比账单的名不见经传的上海中间人，另一名是这位中间人为之工作的隐居香港的亿万富翁。
"The billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, was one of the most influential tycoons of China's gilded age, creating a financial empire in recent decades by exploiting ties to the Communist Party elite and a new class of superrich businessmen. He also controlled a hidden offshore network of more than 130 companies holding over $5 billion in assets, according to corporate documents obtained by The New York Times. Among them was Sotheby's invoice for the van Gogh.",那名亿万富翁叫肖建华，他曾是中国镀金时代最有影响力的大亨之一，他利用与中共精英和一个新超级富豪阶层的关系，在几十年的时间里打造了一个金融帝国。《纽约时报》获得的公司文件显示，肖建华还曾控制着一个由130多家公司组成、总资产超过50亿美元的隐秘离岸公司网络。苏富比结清梵高画作拍卖费的账单就是开给其中一家公司的。
"The secrecy that pervades the art world and its dealmakers including international auction houses like Sotheby's has drawn scrutiny in the years since the sale as authorities try to combat criminal activity. Large transactions often pass through murky intermediaries, and the vetting of them is opaque. Citing client confidentiality, Sotheby's declined to comment on the purchase.",在那笔交易之后的几年里，随着当局试图打击犯罪活动，盛行于艺术市场和艺术品交易商(包括像苏富比这样的国际拍卖行)当中秘而不宣的做法受到密切关注。艺术市场的天价交易常常通过不透明的中介进行，而对这些中介的审查也缺乏透明。苏富比以为客户保密为由，拒绝对那笔交易置评。
"Today, Mr. Xiao is a man who has fallen far. Abducted from his luxury apartment and now imprisoned in mainland China, he was convicted of bribery and other misdeeds that prosecutors claimed had threatened the country's financial security. Meanwhile, Mr. Wang is struggling, liquidating properties as his film studio loses money each year.",如今，肖建华已跌入深渊。他从居住的豪华公寓被人绑架，目前关押在中国大陆，法院判定他犯有贿赂罪，以及检察官称之为威胁国家金融安全的其他不当行为。与此同时，王中军也在惨淡经营，由于年年亏损，他的制片公司正在清算资产。
"And the still life, according to several art experts, has been offered for private sale. For a century after van Gogh gathered flowers and placed them in an earthen vase to paint, the artwork's provenance could be easily traced, and the piece was often exhibited in museums for visitors to admire. Now the painting has vanished from public view, its whereabouts unknown.",据几名艺术专家称，那幅静物画作已交人进行私下出售。在梵高采来鲜花、将它们放在陶瓶中作画后的一个世纪里，这幅画的出处曾很容易追溯，也曾经常在博物馆展出、供人观赏。现在这幅画已从公众视野中消失，下落不明。
A Painting's Many Lives,一幅画的前世今生
"In May 1890, van Gogh arrived in Auvers-sur-Oise, a rustic village outside Paris. Deeply depressed, he had cut off much of his left ear a year and a half earlier. His stay at an asylum had not helped.",1890年5月，梵高来到瓦兹河畔欧韦，这是位于巴黎郊外一个淳朴的村庄。由于极度抑郁，他曾在一年半前割掉了自己的大部分左耳。在精神病院住了一段时间对他也没有多大帮助。
"But within hours of coming to the village, he met Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, a doctor and an art enthusiast.",在来到村庄后的几个小时里，梵高遇到了艺术爱好者保罗-费迪南德·嘉舍医生。
"""I've found in Dr. Gachet a ready-made friend and something like a new brother,"" van Gogh wrote to his sister.","""我发现嘉舍医生就像是一个老朋友，一个新的兄弟，""梵高在给妹妹的信中写道。"
"The physician encouraged van Gogh to ignore his melancholy and focus on his paintings. He completed nearly 80 of them in two months, including ""Portrait of Dr. Gachet,"" considered a masterpiece. He produced ""Vase With Daisies and Poppies"" at the physician's home and may have given it to him in exchange for treatment, biographers say.",嘉舍医生鼓励梵高不理会自己的忧郁，集中精力作画。梵高在两个月内完成了近80幅油画，其中包括《嘉舍医生的肖像》，这件作品被视为杰作。梵高的传记作者们说，《雏菊与罂粟花》是在嘉舍医生家里画的，也许是作为治疗费交换给医生的。
"After van Gogh's death in July 1890, the painting passed to a Parisian collector, and then, in 1911, as the artist's fame was rising, to a Berlin art dealer. A series of German collectors owned it before A. Conger Goodyear, a Buffalo industrialist and a founder of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, bought it in 1928. His son George later granted partial ownership to Buffalo's Albright-Knox Art Gallery, which displayed it for nearly three decades.",1890年7月梵高去世后，这幅画转到了巴黎一名藏家手中，后来随着梵高的名气上升，这幅画在1911年转到柏林一名艺术品经销商手中。布法罗的实业家、纽约现代艺术博物馆创始人康格·古德伊尔在1928年将其买下之前，曾有几名德国收藏家先后拥有过这幅画。古德伊尔的儿子乔治后来将这幅画的部分所有权授予了布法罗的奥尔布赖特-诺克斯美术馆，该画曾在美术馆展出了近三十年时间。
"In May 1990, capping years of record-breaking prices for van Goghs, a Japanese businessman spent $82.5 million for ""Portrait of Dr. Gachet"" at Christie's, then the highest price paid at auction for any artwork.",在梵高画作连续多年创下拍卖价格纪录后，1990年5月，一名日本商人花8250万美元在佳士得拍卖会上买下了《嘉舍医生的肖像》，那是截至当时艺术品拍卖的最高价。
"About that time, Mr. Goodyear wanted to sell the 26-by-20-inch still life to raise money for another museum. It failed to sell at Christie's in November 1990, where it had been expected to fetch between $12 million and $16 million. Soon after, a lower offer was accepted from a buyer who remained anonymous.",大约在那个时候，为了给另一家博物馆筹集资金，古德伊尔想把这幅高26英寸、宽20英寸的静物画卖掉。人们曾预计它能拍出1200万美元到1600万美元之间的价格，但这幅画在1990年11月的佳士得拍卖会上没能卖出去。不久后，一名不愿透露姓名的买家以更低的出价将其买下。
"Most of the 400 or so oil paintings van Gogh produced during his last years considered his best work are at arts institutions around the world. About 15 percent are in private hands and not regularly on loan to museums. In the past decade, just 16 have been offered at auction, according to Artnet, an industry database. Among them was ""Orchard With Cypresses,"" from the collection of the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which Christie's sold last year for $117 million to an undisclosed buyer.",梵高晚期创作的400多幅油画被认为是他最好的作品，其中大部分被世界各地的艺术机构收藏。大约15%在私人手里，而且不定期地借给博物馆展出。据行业数据库Artnet的数据，过去十年里，只有16件梵高画作被拍卖，其中包括微软联合创始人保罗·艾伦收藏的《柏树旁盛开的果园》，佳士得去年以1.17亿美元的价格将其卖给了一位匿名买家。
The Producer and the Billionaire,制片人与亿万富翁
"For a year after the November 2014 auction, Mr. Wang kept the still life at his $25 million apartment in Hong Kong. In October 2015, the film producer was the guest of honor at a five-day exhibition in the city. An amateur artist, he had more than a dozen of his own oil paintings on display.",在2014年11月拍下那件作品后的一年里，王中军曾把它放在他位于香港、价值2500万美元的豪宅里。2015年10月，那幅画曾在香港公开展出了五天，王中军是那次展览的主宾，他也是一名业余艺术家，那次展览还包括十几幅他本人的油画。
"But the main attractions were the van Gogh and a Picasso he had recently bought, ""Woman With a Hairbun on a Sofa."" Sotheby's said Mr. Wang had paid nearly $30 million for the work.",但展览会上最吸引人的是那幅梵高画作和王中军在那不久前买下的毕加索作品《盘发髻女子坐像》。 苏富比称，王中军为那件毕加索作品花了近3000万美元(约合人民币1.85亿元)。
"Until then, Japanese industrialists, followed by American hedge fund managers and Russian oligarchs, had captured headlines for record-breaking purchases. Around 2012, newly rich Chinese buyers, who had benefited from their country's market-opening policies, came on the scene.",那之前，日本的实业家们，以及紧随其后的美国对冲基金经理和俄罗斯寡头曾以破纪录的竞拍价登上头条新闻。大约在2012年前后，受益于市场改革开放政策的中国新贵买家们出现在拍卖会上。
"""All the auction houses really jumped on that,"" said David Norman, who headed Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern art department when the van Gogh was sold.","""所有的拍卖行都对中国卖家的到来迫不及待，""戴维·诺曼说，苏富比拍卖那幅梵高作品时，他是该行印象派及现代艺术部负责人。"
"Chinese billionaires were often delighted to announce their big-ticket purchases. In 2013, a retail magnate bought a Picasso for $28 million at Christie's, following up with a $20 million Monet at Sotheby's in 2015. The same year, a stock investor spent $170 million at Christie's for a Modigliani.",中国的亿万富翁们往往乐意宣扬他们花大价钱买来的东西。2013 年，一名房地产巨头花2800万美元在佳士得买下了一幅毕加索画作，之后又在2015年花2000万美元在苏富比买下了一幅莫奈画作。同年，一名股票投资者花1.7亿美元在佳士得买下了一幅莫迪利亚尼的画作。
"""It is a combination of vanity, investment and building their own brand,"" said Kejia Wu, who taught at Sotheby's Institute of Art and is the author of a new book on China's art market.","""这是出于虚荣心，也是为了投资和树立自己的名声，""在苏富比艺术学院任教的吴可佳说，他是一本关于中国艺术市场的新书的作者。"
"Mr. Wang, 63, basked in the spotlight. In interviews, he spoke of his admiration for van Gogh and the artist's influence on him. ""Few people in the world would buy this kind of painting there aren't that many who love Impressionist art this much and can afford it, right?""","现年63岁的王中军曾沉浸在聚光灯下。他多次在采访中谈到他对梵高的欣赏，以及梵高对自己的影响。""这种画全世界没有几个人买。买得起，还又这么酷爱印象派艺术(的人不多)，对吧?"""
"Days after the hammer fell at Sotheby's, Mr. Wang had told a Chinese publication that he had not bought the painting alone, though he offered no details. Later, he no longer mentioned any partner. ""When I saw the painting at a preview, I just felt like owning it it stirred my heart,"" he said in an interview published on Sotheby's website.","苏富比拍卖行的这笔交易落槌后没几天，王中军曾对一家中国出版物说，那幅画并不是他一个人购买的，但他没有提供任何细节。后来，他不再提及任何人和他一起参与了购买的事情。""就是在看预展的时候，我觉得想拥有，心一动而已，""他在苏富比网站上发表的一篇采访中说。"
"The high-profile acquisition, made through an intermediary and with the ultimate source of funds remaining a secret, is the kind of transaction governments have been trying to curb in recent years.",近年来，各国政府一直试图遏制这种通过中间人进行、最终的资金来源始终秘而不宣的高调购买。
"In one scandal, the United States charged a Malaysian businessman with laundering billions of dollars from a state development fund, using some of it to buy art at Sotheby's and Christie's. In 2020, the Senate issued a scathing report on how auction houses and art dealershad unwittingly helped Russians evade sanctions by allowing others to buy art for them.",在一起丑闻中，美国司法部指控一名马来西亚商人把从国家发展基金侵吞的数十亿美元进行洗钱，并用其中一部分在苏富比和佳士得购买艺术品。2020年，美国参议院发布的报告猛烈抨击了拍卖行和艺术品经销商，称它们通过允许他人代俄罗斯人出面购买艺术品，无意中帮助俄罗斯人逃避了制裁。
"A spokeswoman for Sotheby's said it vetted all buyers and, when necessary, enlisted its compliance department for ""enhanced due diligence."" Sotheby's applies worldwide a 2020 European Union rule that requires auction houses to verify the legitimacy of funds.","苏富比的一名发言人说，所有买家都经过了审查，而且在有必要的时候，还会让公司的合规部门对买家进行""增强尽职调查""。苏富比在全球范围内遵循一项2020年的欧盟规定，该规定要求拍卖行核实买家资金的合法性。"
"While the financial documents involving the van Gogh do not show wrongdoing, the transaction was hardly routine. Soon after the auction, Sotheby's transferred ownership of the painting to the Shanghai man, neither a known art agent nor a collector, who paid the bill. But in a public ceremony, Sotheby's handed over the painting not to him or the billionaire who employed him but to the producer, Mr. Wang.",虽然与那幅梵高画作交易有关的财务文件并没有显示不当行为，但那笔交易与常规做法相去甚远。拍卖成交后不久，苏富比将那幅画的所有权转交给了一个上海人，他既没有艺术品经纪人的名声，也不是收藏家，但他支付了费用。但在一个公开的仪式上，苏富比不是将这幅画交给了那个上海人或雇用他的那个亿万富翁，而是交给了制片人王中军。
"""There's a connection to someone who is now incarcerated,"" said Leila Amineddoleh, a New York-based art lawyer. ""Something unusual is going on.""","""这件事与一名现已被关进监狱的人有关，""在纽约艺术行业担任律师的莱拉·阿明多莱说。""这里面有一些不同寻常的事情。"""
'White Gloves',"""白手套"""
"The man Sotheby's considers the owner of the van Gogh lives in a Shanghai apartment complex where gray tiles and grimy grout frame a weather-beaten door. A mat out front states nine times, in English, ""I am an artist.""","苏富比认定的梵高画作主人住在上海的一座公寓楼里，灰色瓷砖和脏兮兮的灰浆框着一扇破旧的门。门前的一张垫子上用英语写了九遍""我是一名艺术家""字样。"
"The occupant, Liu Hailong, is listed as the sole owner and lone director of the shell companyin the British Virgin Islandsthat paid for the painting: Islandwide Holdings Limited. Other than his date and place of birth, little is known about Mr. Liu, 46.",这栋房子的主人刘海龙被列为英属维尔京群岛一家空壳公司的唯一所有者和唯一董事，它名为全岛控股有限公司 (Islandwide Holdings Limited)，这家公司为这幅画支付了费用。除了出生日期和地点，外界对46岁的刘海龙几乎一无所知。
"When a reporter recently showed him the Sotheby's invoice and a bank wire document and asked whether the signature was his, he said, ""Please leave immediately,"" and shut the door.","最近，一名记者向他展示苏富比的发票和一份银行电汇文件，问签名是不是他本人的，他说:""你现在马上走。""然后关上了门。"
"A woman living with him, Zhao Tingting, has her own connection to the jailed billionaire, Mr. Xiao. She was once a top official at a company he co-founded, which had business dealings with relatives of China's top leader, Xi Jinping.",和他住在一起的赵婷婷与被监禁的亿万富翁肖建华也存在联系。她曾经是肖建华参与创办的一家公司的高层，该公司与中国最高领导人习近平的亲属有业务往来。
"Ms. Zhao, 43, who no longer holds that position, now teaches piano. Asked about Mr. Liu's purchase of the van Gogh, she responded, ""Do you think our house comes close to the price of that painting?""","现年43岁的赵婷婷不再担任这个职位，如今在教钢琴。当被问及刘海龙购买的那幅梵高作品时，她回答说，""您觉得我们家的房子够那幅画的价格吗?"""
"She and Mr. Liu were ""just ordinary little employees,"" she said, with no connection to the Tomorrow Group, the collection of companies controlled by the billionaire. ""We have no right to make any decisions and no right to know anything.""","她说，她和刘海龙""只是普通小员工而已""，与那位亿万富翁控制的明天集团没有任何关系。""我们没有任何的支配权跟知情权。"""
"The couple appear to have been ""white gloves,"" a term used in China to describe proxy shareholders meant to hide companies' true owners. Among the thousands of pages of records providing details about the Tomorrow Groupisa spreadsheet listing dozens of such people. At least four offshore companies were registered in Mr. Liu's name.","这对夫妇似乎是""白手套""，这个词在中国用来形容代理股东，目的是隐藏公司的真正所有者。在提供""明天集团""详细信息的数以千计页数的记录中，有一份电子表格列出了数十名这样的人。至少有四家离岸公司以刘海龙的名义注册。"
"Those companies were part of Mr. Xiao's vast enterprise. He had showed early promise, gaining admission to China's prestigious Peking University at age 14 and serving as a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen protests. He sided with the government, an allegiance that would help him become one of the country's richest men, acquiring control of banks, insurers and brokerages, as well as stakes in coal, cement and real estate.",这些公司是肖建华庞大企业的一部分。他很早就显示出很有出息的样子，14岁就进入了中国著名学府北京大学，1989年的天安门抗议活动期间，他是学生会主席。当时他站在了政府一边，这种忠诚后来帮助他成为中国最富有的人之一，获得了银行、保险公司和经纪公司的控制权，以及煤炭、水泥和房地产公司的股份。
"Unlike the many brash billionaires he did business with, Mr. Xiao, now 51, preferred to operate in the shadows, building ties to some of China's princelings. He settled into a quiet life at the Four Seasons, where a coterie of female bodyguards attended to his needs.",与同他做生意的许多傲慢张扬的亿万富翁不同，51岁的肖建华更喜欢在暗处运作，与中国的一些太子党建立关系。他在四季酒店过着平静的生活，有一群女保镖照顾他。
"Why one of his lieutenants paid for the van Gogh is not clear. Mr. Wang, the producer, was among the ranks of China's wealthiest people, though not nearly as rich as Mr. Xiao.",为什么他的一个手下要买下这幅梵高画作目前尚不得而知。制片人王中军也曾是中国顶级富豪之一，尽管其财富远不及肖建华。
"Mr. Xiao's easy access to money outside China through his offshore network allowed him to bypass the country's strict currency controls; he may have acted as a kind of banker for Mr. Wang. The documents show that the two men were drawing up art investment plans the same month as the auction, but their joint venture, based in the Seychelles, wasn't formed until a year later. Meanwhile, the two set up another offshore company, aimed at investing in film and television projects in North America.",肖建华通过他的海外网络很容易在境外获得资金，这使他可以绕过中国严格的货币管制;他可能为王中军充当了某种银行家的角色。文件显示，两人在拍卖的同一个月开始制定艺术品投资计划，但他们在塞舌尔的合资企业直到一年后才成立。与此同时，两人还成立了另一家海外公司，旨在投资北美的电影和电视项目。
"There could be another explanation for the payment: Mr. Xiao may have wanted to acquire an asset that could be transported across borders in a private jet, free from scrutiny by bank compliance officers and government regulators.",关于这笔款项可能还有另一种解释:肖建华可能是想收购一项可以用私人飞机跨境运输的资产，从而避开银行合规官员和政府监管机构的审查。
"An Abduction, and a Vanishing Act",一场绑架与一件消失的艺术品
"The fortunes of the men connected to the van Gogh purchase began to turn in 2015 with the crash of the Chinese stock market. Mr. Xi's government blamed market manipulation by well-connected traders, and regulators wrested economic power back from the billionaires. Dozens of financiers disappeared, only to resurface in police custody.",2015年，随着中国股市崩盘，与梵高画作交易相关者的命运开始发生转变。习近平政府指责人脉广泛的交易商操纵市场，监管机构从亿万富翁手中夺回经济权力。数十名金融家失踪后，在警方的拘留所里重新露面。
"Art purchases became more discreet. In 2016, Oprah Winfrey sold a Klimt painting to an anonymous Chinese buyer for $150 million.",艺术品的购买变得更加谨慎。2016年，奥普拉·温弗瑞以1.5亿美元的价格将克林姆特的一幅画卖给了一位匿名的中国买家。
"By early 2017, Mr. Xiao's life as a free man was over. One night, about a half-dozen men put him in a wheelchair he was not known to use one covered his face and removed him from his Hong Kong apartment. He was taken to mainland China and eventually charged. Prosecutors claimed that his crimes dated back before 2014, the year the van Gogh was sold.",到2017年初，肖建华作为自由人的生活结束了。一天晚上，大约六名男子把他放在轮椅上——大家都知道他不用轮椅——蒙住他的脸，把他从香港的公寓带走。他被带到中国大陆并最终被起诉。检察官声称，他的罪行可以追溯到2014年之前，也就是那副梵高画作被出售的那一年。
He was sentenced last August to 13 years in prison for manipulating financial markets and bribing state officials. The court said Mr. Xiao and his company had misused more than $20 billion.,去年8月，他因操纵金融市场和贿赂政府官员被判处13年监禁。法院说，肖建华和他的公司擅自运用资金1486亿元。
"Government officials dismantled his companies in China. At some point, the British Virgin Islands business that bought the van Gogh changed hands and Mr. Liu was removed as its owner.",政府官员拆解了他在中国的公司。在那期间，购买梵高画作的英属维尔京群岛公司易手，刘海龙失去了所有者的身份。
"For a while, Mr. Wang, the producer, maintained a high-flying lifestyle, opening a private museum in Beijing in 2017 that showcased the van Gogh and Picasso paintings for a few months.",有一段时间，制片人王中军保持着高调的生活方式，2017年在北京开了一家私人美术馆，把梵高和毕加索的画作展示了几个月。
"But the market value of his film studio, Huayi Brothers, vaporized as it backed flops. Mr. Wang let go much of his art collection and his Hong Kong home. Last year the Beijing museum was sold off, along with a mansion tied to him in Beverly Hills.",但他的电影公司华谊兄弟因为制作的片子票房惨败市值蒸发。王中军放弃了大部分艺术收藏和他在香港的家。去年，他在北京的美术馆以及在比佛利山庄的一处豪宅被出售。
"Mr. Wang and a spokesman for his company did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mr. Xiao could not be reached for comment in prison, though a family representative said the billionaire's wife did not know of any involvement in the van Gogh purchase and was unfamiliar with Mr. Liu.",王中军及其公司发言人没有回应记者的多次置评请求。记者无法联系到狱中的肖建华发表评论，不过一名家庭代表称，肖建华的妻子不知道梵高作品拍卖的事，也不熟悉刘海龙。
Van Gogh's floral still life a vibrant painting by one of the world's most acclaimed artists hasn't been seen publicly for years. But there are reports that the artwork may be back on the market.,这副出自世界上最受赞誉的艺术家之一之手、栩栩如生的花卉静物画已经多年没有公开露面。但有报道称，这件作品可能会重新回到市场上。
"Three people, including two former Sotheby's executives and a New York art adviser, requesting anonymity, said the painting had been offered for private sale. Last year, the adviser viewed a written proposal to buy it for about $70 million.",包括两名苏富比前高管和一名纽约艺术顾问在内的三名要求匿名的人士表示，这幅画曾被提议私下出售。去年，这位顾问看到了一份以约7000万美元收购该作品的书面提议。
The art experts did not know whether the painting had sold or if concerns had been raised about the 2014 sale a purchase by a onetime lieutenant to a now disgraced billionaire linked to a beleaguered film producer who claimsthe art belongs to him.,这些艺术专家不知道该画作是否已经售出，也不知道是否会有人对2014年的拍卖存在担忧。当时这幅画被一位现已声名扫地的亿万富翁的手下购买，而这位富翁又与一位陷入困境的电影制片人存在联系，后者声称这幅画属于自己。
"""Nobody needs a $62 million van Gogh, and nobody wants to buy a lawsuit,"" said Thomas C. Danziger, an art lawyer. ""If there's any question about the painting's ownership, people will buy a different artwork or another airplane.""","""没人需要一幅价值6200万美元的梵高作品，也没人愿意花钱买一场官司，""艺术律师托马斯·丹齐格说。""如果对这幅画的所有权有任何疑问，人们会购买其他的艺术品——或者另一架飞机。"""
"China plans to complete a mission to land a person on the moon by 2030, a government official announced on Monday, in the highest-level confirmation of China's ambitions for a crewed lunar landing.",一名政府官员周一宣布，中国计划在2030年前完成载人登月任务，这是对中国载人登月雄心的最高级别确认。
"Chinese scientists have previously nodded at a 2030 goal in a less formal capacity; for example, the chief designer of China's lunar exploration program said last month that a 2030 landing would be ""no problem.""","此前，中国科学家曾以较为非官方的身份对2030年的登月目标表示认可;中国探月工程总设计师就曾在上个月表示，2030年登陆""没问题""。"
"""We can clasp the moon in the ninth heaven,"" Lin Xiqiang, the deputy director of China's Manned Space Agency, said at a news conference on Monday, quoting a Mao Zedong poem.","中国载人航天工程办公室副主任林西强在周一的新闻发布会上引用了一句毛泽东的诗句:""可上九天揽月。"""
"Mr. Lin said the moon landing project, part of the country's broader Lunar Exploration Project also known as the Chang'e Project, for the Chinese moon goddess had ""recently"" been kick-started, though he did not offer specifics. The project would also seek to enable short-term stays on the lunar surface, as well as collect samples and conduct research, he said.","林西强说，登月计划已在""最近""启动，但没有提供具体细节。该计划属于中国更广泛的探月工程的一部分，该工程也被称为嫦娥工程，这个名字来自中国神话中住在月亮上的仙女。他说，该项目还将寻求在月球短期驻留，以及采集样本并进行研究。"
"The Monday announcement came at a news conference to mark the liftoff of three new astronauts on Tuesday to China's new space station, which was completed late last year.",周一的公告是在介绍即将前往中国新空间站的三名新宇航员的新闻发布会上发布的，该空间站于去年年底建设完成。
"A manned lunar landing would be a major milestone for China's, and the world's, space exploration: No human has been on the moon since the United States' Apollo missions in the 1960s and '70s. And it could mark a significant achievement for China in its burgeoning competition with the United States in space. China's top leader, Xi Jinping, has said that the country should become a ""great space power.""","载人登月将成为中国乃至世界太空探索的一个重要里程碑:自20世纪60年代和70年代美国的阿波罗计划以来，还没有人登上月球。这可能标志着中国在与美国进展迅速的太空竞争中取得了重大成就。中国最高领导人习近平曾表示，中国应该成为""航天大国""。"
"NASA has also announced a plan to put people including the first woman and first person of color on the moon again, with a target of 2025. But the Artemis program, as the plan is known, has faced delays. Both Beijing and Washington have also laid out goals of building a research station on the moon and landing people on Mars.",美国航空航天局(NASA)也宣布了一项计划，于2025年再次将人类送上月球，并将首次包括女性和有色人种在内。这个被称为阿耳忒弥斯登月计划的项目已面临延误。北京和华盛顿都制定了在月球上建立研究站和将人类送上火星的目标。
"Space has become another arena for U.S.-China tensions, with echoes of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. NASA's administrator, Bill Nelson, has said that the United States should ""watch out"" for Chinese attempts to dominate the lunar surface and keep Americans out. A Pentagon report last year warned that China could overtake American capabilities in space by 2045.","太空已经成为美中关系紧张的又一个竞技场，让人想起冷战时期美苏之间的太空竞赛。NASA局长比尔·尼尔森曾表示，美国应该""警惕""中国试图控制月球表面并将美国人拒之门外的企图。五角大楼去年的一份报告警告，到2045年，中国可能会在太空领域超越美国。"
"China's space program has developed rapidly in recent years, while America's has often been bogged down by conflicting priorities and changing administrations. China is the only country to have successfully landed on the moon in the 21st century, and in 2019 it also became the first to land a probe on the moon's far side.",中国的太空计划近年来发展迅速，而美国的太空计划却经常因为相互冲突的优先事项和政府的更替而陷入困境。中国是21世纪唯一成功登月的国家，并在2019年成为第一个在月球背面着陆探测器的国家。
"While some have hoped that China and the United States could cooperate on space exploration even as geopolitical tensions rise, a provision in the U.S. law that finances NASA bans direct cooperation with the Chinese space agency or Chinese-owned companies. China has signaled that it will cooperate with Russia on space programs.",尽管一些人希望中美在地缘政治紧张局势加剧的情况下仍然能够在太空探索方面进行合作，但美国为NASA提供资金的法律中有条款禁止与中国国家航天局或中资公司直接合作。中国已表示将与俄罗斯在太空项目上展开合作。
"Few major airlines in the world were hit by the Covid pandemic as hard as Cathay Pacific, the flagship carrier of Hong Kong, or have labored so mightily to recover from it. Its business was decimated by some of the industry's most expansive flight bans and quarantine requirements. And the pandemic wasn't the start of Cathay's troubles.",世界上很少有大型航司像香港的载旗航空国泰那样受到疫情的严重打击，也很少有航司像国泰航空那样为了恢复付出如此巨大的努力。该公司的业务因一些业内最广泛的飞行禁令和隔离要求而遭受重创。而新冠大流行并不是国泰航空麻烦的开始。
"In 2019, when Hong Kong was convulsed by pro-democracy protests, Cathay Pacific was caught in the crossfire with Beijing. Flights were canceled or delayed by airport sit-ins involving thousands of demonstrators, among them employees of the airline, Cathay Pacific. Chinese officials threatened to bar crew members who joined the protests, or even voiced support for them, from flying into China.",2019年香港因民主抗议活动而剧烈动荡时，国泰航空被卷入这场与北京的争端。由于数以千计示威者在机场静坐抗议，导致航班取消或延误，示威者中也包括国泰航空的员工。中国官员威胁要禁止参加抗议活动的机组人员，甚至是那些仅表示支持抗议的机组人员飞往中国。
"Turmoil grew inside Cathay Pacific. The airline's chief executive and chairman both resigned, and new leaders began cracking down on anything employees said or posted on social media that could anger China.",国泰航空内部的动荡日益加剧。该航空公司的行政总裁和董事局主席双双辞职，新的领导人开始打击员工在社交媒体上发表任何可能激怒中国的言论或帖子。
"In 2020, as the pandemic grounded its business, Cathay shuttered its regional division, Cathay Dragon. It parked 70 unused planes in the desert in Alice Springs, Australia, and fired 5,300 employees based in Hong Kong. As the city lengthened the mandatory quarantines, some aircrew had to enter three- to four-week-long ""closed loop"" work shifts, enduring weeks away from home that were devastating to employee morale.","2020年，由于疫情导致停飞，国泰航空关闭了子公司国泰港龙航空。国泰在澳大利亚爱丽丝泉的沙漠中存放了70架飞机，并解雇了5300名驻香港的员工。随着香港延长强制隔离时间，一些机组人员不得不进入为期三到四周的""闭环""轮班，忍受数周不能回家的生活，这对员工的士气是极大的打击。"
"Today Cathay Pacific is still struggling to hire enough pilots, flight crew and other staffers to compete with other airlines. Its rivals ""have emerged leaner, fitter and eager to take customers away from us,"" the company's chief executive, Ronald Lam, said in a video message to employees in January, trying to rally them around a plan ""to survive and thrive."" Cathay Pacific climbed back to 50 percent of its prepandemic flight capacity only in March.","如今，国泰航空仍在想方设法招聘足够的飞行员、机组人员和其他员工，以便与其他航司竞争。该公司首席执行官林绍波今年1月在发给员工的一段视频信息中说，其竞争对手""变得更精简、更健康，急于从我们这里抢走客户""，他试图让大家围绕一项""生存和发展""的计划团结起来。直到3月，国泰航空的客运运力才恢复到疫情前的50%。"
"The problems continue. Last week, in an internal memo, Mr. Lam informed Cathay Pacific's staff that three employees had been fired after an audio recording went viral of cabin crew members ridiculing a passenger's English. Mr. Lam said the employees had caused ""significant damage to the image of Hong Kong and Cathay.""","但问题依然存在。上周，林绍波在一份内部备忘录中告诉国泰航空的员工，一段机组人员嘲笑一名乘客英语水平的录音在网上疯传，三名员工因此被解雇。林绍波说，这些员工""严重损害了香港和国泰航空的形象""。"
"The episode was a reminder of the delicate task Cathay Pacific faces in navigating its relationship with China. China is a vital market for the airline, but its economy is still recovering after being closed off to Hong Kong and the rest of the world for nearly three years. Before the pandemic, Cathay flew from Hong Kong to 119 places in 35 countries, including 26 destinations in China. Its convenient flight times from cities across China allowed passengers to change planes in Hong Kong by night and arrive in the United States or Europe by morning or early afternoon.",这件事提醒人们，在处理同中国的关系时，国泰航空面临着棘手的任务。中国是该航司的一个重要市场，但在对香港和世界其他地区关闭近三年之后，中国经济仍在复苏。疫情暴发前，国泰航空从香港飞往35个国家的119个地方，其中包括中国的26个目的地。从中国各城市出发的航班时间方便了乘客夜间在香港转机，并在上午或下午早些时候抵达美国或欧洲。
"At the height of the Omicron outbreak in January 2022, when the Hong Kong government banned inbound flights from countries including the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, the airline was flying at only 2 percent of its passenger flight capacity.",在2022年1月奥密克戎疫情最严重的时候，香港政府禁止来自美国、澳大利亚和英国等国家的航班入境，当时国泰仅发挥了2%的客运能力。
"In a statement, the airline said it aimed to return to 70 percent flight capacity and 80 destinations by the end of 2023, with 160 flights per week to 16 airports in mainland China.",该航空公司在一份声明中表示，其目标是到2023年底恢复70%的客运航班运力和80个目的地，每周有160个航班飞往中国大陆的16个机场。
"Even after Hong Kong removed its Covid-related rules and quarantine requirements, Beijing's determined influence over the former British colony still threatens the reputation it has enjoyed for decades as an attractive, freewheeling destination for business.",即使在香港取消了与新冠相关的规定和隔离要求之后，北京对这个前英国殖民地的坚定影响仍威胁着香港几十年来作为一个有吸引力的自由商业目的地的声誉。
"Just as Hong Kong was the world's portal to China, Cathay Pacific was a vanguard in connecting emerging economies in Asia to New York, London and Paris. Founded in 1946, it was one of the city's most important brands, known for its punctuality and premium service. The airport's third runway opened last year to accommodate Beijing's plans to integrate Hong Kong with Macau and nine cities in the Guangdong province into a tech hub known as the Greater Bay Area.",正如香港是世界通往中国的门户一样，国泰航空是连接亚洲新兴经济体与纽约、伦敦和巴黎的先锋。它成立于1946年，是香港最重要的品牌之一，以准时和优质服务而闻名。该机场的第三条跑道于去年启用，以适应北京将香港、澳门和广东省的九个城市整合成名为大湾区的科技中心的计划。
"Cathay Pacific said it doesn't expect a full recovery until next year. Its most immediate challenges are restoring its pilot and cabin crew head count, and increasing flight capacity.",国泰航空表示预计明年才会完全复苏。该公司最紧迫的挑战是恢复飞行员和机组人员的数量，并增加航班运力。
"To cut costs, Cathay has slashed pilot base salaries by about 40 percent, angering many members of its aircrew. In January, in response to the airline's use of fewer flight attendants per flight and reduction of recovery time between long flights, the Cathay Pacific Flight Attendants Union introduced a ""work to rule"" campaign: discouraging flight attendants from performing duties beyond the scope of company guidelines. Officials with Hong Kong's Airport Authority said in May that they had observed a trend of lower taxiing speeds among Cathay pilots after the airline's new pay structure in effect gave them a disincentive from completing flights earlier than scheduled.","为了削减成本，国泰航空将飞行员的基本工资削减了约40%，这激怒了许多机组人员。今年1月，国泰航空减少了每个航班上的空乘人员数量，并缩短了长途航班之间的恢复时间，为此，国泰航空公司空中服务员工会发起了""按章工作""活动:劝阻空乘人员执行超出公司准则范围的任务。香港机场管理局的官员今年5月表示，他们注意到国泰航空的飞行员中存在降低滑行速度的趋势，这是因为该公司新的薪酬结构实际上挫伤了他们提前完成航班的积极性。"
"""They said we've got to save cash, but there's not much point saving cash if you haven't got an airline at the end of it,"" said Paul Weatherilt, chairman of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association, a pilot's union, and a Cathay Pacific pilot for nearly three decades. ""And that's sort of the position they're in now. They have half the airline.""","""他们说我们得过紧日子，但如果你连公司都没了，省钱就没有多大意义，""飞行员工会香港航空机组人员协会主席保罗·韦瑟里特说，他在国泰航空担任了近30年的飞行员。""这就是他们现在的处境。公司只剩一半了。"""
"Before 2019, the airline had 3,840 pilots. Since then, 1,900 have resigned, according to the Aircrew Officers Association. The number of captains, the most senior pilots, has been halved. And while Cathay Pacific rehired dozens of pilots from the shuttered Cathay Dragon division in 2021 and 2022, many had to take pay cuts and demotions when accepting their offers. The lack of flights during the pandemic slowed the development of the training that first and second officers need to become captains. Senior pilot trainers and flight simulator instructors quit.",在2019年之前，该航空公司有3840名飞行员。据航空机组人员协会称，自那以来，已有1900人辞职。机长，也就是最高级的飞行员的数量已经减少了一半。虽然国泰航空在2021年和2022年从关闭的国泰港龙部门重新雇佣了数十名飞行员，但许多人在接受聘用时不得不减薪和降职。疫情期间缺少飞行，拖累了第一副驾驶和第二副驾驶成为机长所需的培训进程。许多高级飞行员教官和飞行模拟器教官辞职。
"Despite its struggles, some industry analysts are optimistic that Cathay Pacific will recover. The company reported an annual profit last year, its first since 2019. Its flights are about 90 percent full, which is better than before the pandemic, and high ticket prices have helped revenue. During the pandemic, business from cargo flights kept the airline afloat.",尽管处境艰难，但一些行业分析师对国泰航空将复苏持乐观态度。该公司去年报告了自2019年以来的首次年度利润。该公司的航班上座率约为90%，这比疫情前的情况要好，高票价也有助于提高收入。疫情期间，货运航班的业务维持了该航空公司的运营。
"But no market is as important now to Cathay Pacific, or as potentially fraught, as China.",但对于国泰航空来说，没有一个市场比中国更重要，同时又可能带来如此多的困扰。
"The most recent trouble stemmed from the complaint of a passenger who had flown on May 21 from the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu to Hong Kong and posted a recording of flight attendants overheard in the galley laughing about a passenger who had apparently requested a ""carpet"" instead of a blanket. ""If you cannot say 'blanket' in English, you cannot have it,"" one flight attendant said in the recording.","最近的麻烦源于5月21日从中国西南城市成都飞往香港的一名乘客的投诉，这位乘客上传了一段录音，其中可以听到空乘人员在厨房嘲笑一名乘客，后者似乎在要毯子时说成了""地毯""。""如果你不会用英语说'毯子'，你就没毯子用，""一名空乘人员在录音中说。"
"The recording dominated discussions on Chinese social media, with people posting about what they saw as a history of snubs by the airline's flight attendants against mainland passengers. Xinhua, a state media agency criticized the airline for ""arrogance,"" ""bad service"" and a lack of sincerity. ""If it doesn't correct its old habits, Cathay Pacific won't fly far,"" read the headline of an editorial article.","这段录音在中国社交媒体上引发了热议，人们纷纷发帖，谈论他们认为国泰航空的空乘人员冷落大陆乘客的往事。官方媒体新华社批评该航空公司""傲慢""""服务差""、缺乏诚意。一篇社论的标题写道《老毛病老不改，国泰航空飞不远》。"
"Hong Kong's top government leader, John Lee, joined the rebukes. ""The words and deeds of the flight attendants hurt the feelings of compatriots in Hong Kong and the mainland and destroyed Hong Kong's traditional culture and values of respect and courtesy,"" he said in a Facebook post.","香港特首李家超也加入了谴责行列。""涉事空中服务员的言行伤害了香港和内地同胞的感情，破坏了香港一向的尊重、有礼的文化和价值观，""他在Facebook上写道。"
"Cathay Pacific apologized on Weibo on Tuesday and said that the airline would open an investigation. By Wednesday, three flight attendants had been fired.",国泰航空周二在微博上道歉，并表示将展开调查。截至周三，三名空乘人员被解雇。
"""We had to respond and act swiftly, which was necessary to protect the interest of the company and in turn our people overall,"" Mr. Lam wrote in the internal memo to employees on Thursday.","""我们必须迅速做出反应，采取行动，这对保护公司乃至全体员工的利益是必要的，""林绍波在周四发给员工的内部备忘录中写道。"
"He added that the remarks were a blow to the airline's reputation. ""Whilst the incident has caused a setback to our rebuild journey, let's embrace it as a valuable lesson,"" he wrote.","他还说，这些言论对该航空公司的声誉是一个打击。""虽然这一事件给我们的重建之旅带来了挫折，但让我们把它当作一个宝贵的教训，""他写道。"
"In December, China abruptly abandoned its draconian ""Zero Covid"" policies, battered by a surge of infections and rising public anger against lockdowns. Half a year on, Covid cases again are on the rise, but this time the nation appears to be determined to press on with normal life as the government focuses on reigniting economic growth.","去年12月，在新冠病毒感染激增、公众对封控的愤怒情绪日益高涨的压力下，中国突然放弃了严厉的""新冠清零""政策。半年后，新冠病毒感染病例再次上升，但这次，随着政府集中精力重振经济增长，中国似乎决定让正常生活继续下去。"
"Though other countries have long settled into such a pattern, it is a shift for China. Until late last year, its national leadership was still ready to lock down whole neighborhoods and districts, even cities, in a bid to stamp out what were sometimes just small clusters of cases.",尽管其他国家对这样做早就习以为常，但对中国来说，这仍是个改变。直到去年年底，为了消除感染，有时只是小型集群性感染，中国领导层仍然会对整个社区和城市部分区域，甚至整座城市进行封控。
"The Chinese health authorities have reported a rise in Covid cases since April, especially from newer subvariants that are spreading across the world. Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent doctor who was among the first to openly confirm in early 2020 that Covid could easily spread among people, estimated on Monday that by late June as many as 65 million people a week could become infected with the coronavirus across China. (That would be up from what he estimated at 40 million infections a week in late May. China no longer publishes regular official nationwide estimates of infections.)",据中国卫生部门发布的报告，自今年4月以来，新冠病毒感染病例有所增加，尤其是正在全球传播的新亚分支的感染病例。钟南山是在2020年初最早公开承认新冠病毒很容易在人群中传播的著名医生，他在周一估计，到6月底，中国这轮新冠病毒感染波峰可达每周最多6500万个病例。(高于他对于5月底将达到每周4000万例的估计。中国已不再定期发布官方估计的全国感染病例数。)
"By comparison, after ""Zero Covid"" controls were set aside in December, new infections reached 37 million a day in China at their peak, according to estimates cited by Bloomberg.","据彭博新闻社引用的估计，相比之下，去年12月取消""新冠清零""控制措施后，中国感染新冠的人数曾在疫情高峰期达到了每天3700万。"
"Even if, as Dr. Zhong acknowledged, the pace of rising infections is laden with uncertainty, a rebound in cases was always likely, and many in China appear steeled to living with a background hum of Covid infections, and sometimes Covid deaths.",尽管像钟南山承认的那样，感染病例上升的速度充满不确定性，但疫情出现反弹的可能性总是存在，而且许多中国人似乎已准备好在时而发生新冠疫情的背景下生活，甚至准备接受新冠有时导致的死亡。
"""People have become used to infections, and they see this as normal in the post-Covid era,"" Lin Zixian, 36, who works for a technology company in Beijing, said in a telephone interview. China's leader, Xi Jinping, still often wears a medical mask when he meets people indoors. But Mr. Lin said that he and other members of his family had stopped masking in most public spaces, as have many people in China.","""人们习惯感染了，也觉得这是后疫情时代的常态吧，""在北京一家科技公司工作、现年36岁的林子先在接受电话采访时说。中国领导人习近平在室内与人见面时仍然经常戴着医用口罩。但林子先说，他和家人在大多数公共场所已不戴口罩了，许多中国人也是如此。"
"""Many of my friends got infected last year and got infected again this year,"" Mr. Lin said. ""Personally, I'm pretty calm about the virus and pandemic.""","""我的许多朋友去年都阳了，今年又二阳了，""林子先说。 ""我个人对病毒、疫情啊挺坦然的吧。"""
"Officials across China appear to be trying to prepare the population for a rise in infections without reintroducing the heavy controls that by late last year had exhausted public patience. Since abandoning its tight restrictions on domestic travel, the government has shifted to reviving growth and job creation. The jobless rate of about 20 percent among urban youth may appear more politically pressing than rising Covid numbers.",中国各地的官员们似乎正试图让民众对感染率上升有所准备，而不是再次采取严格的防控措施，去年年底，公众已对严格防控的做法失去了耐心。自从取消了对国内旅行的严格限制后，政府已转向恢复经济增长和创造就业机会。城市年轻人中约20%的失业率似乎比新冠病毒感染上升在政治上更为紧迫。
"""After most people had caught the last wave, the intensity was gone,"" said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has been finishing a book on China's handling of the pandemic.","""大多数人已在上一波疫情中感染过病毒，再次感染的严重程度不大，""芝加哥大学政治学教授杨大利说，他即将完成一本关于中国应对疫情的书。"
"He added that China now treated Covid as a ""Class B"" illness not the most urgent category and officials, though monitoring the latest increase in cases, ""have also been trying to reassure the public, saying that the symptoms are relatively mild.""","他补充说，中国现已将新冠病毒作为""乙类传染病""对待，而不是最紧迫的那类，虽然官员们仍在对最近的病例增加进行监控，但""也一再表示，这波感染的症状相对较轻，努力让公众放心""。"
"Health officials in Beijing have recommended wearing masks on buses and subways, but it is not mandatory and quite a few passengers do not, especially younger ones. While the recent rise in cases may yet strain hospitals, many people appear more willing to endure the illness at home rather than heading to fever clinics.",虽然北京的卫生官员建议在公共汽车和地铁上戴口罩，但不是强制性的。很多乘客仍不戴口罩，尤其是年轻人。虽然近期感染病例增加可能会给医院带来压力，但许多人感染后似乎更愿意在家休息，而不是去发热门诊看病。
"""Even if my son got Covid, I wouldn't mind staying in the same room with him,"" said Mr. Lin, the technology worker.","""即使是我的儿子得了新冠，我同他呆在同一个房间也还好，我不介意，""从事技术工作的林子先说。"
"For many younger patients, infection can mean a week or so with a fever and other symptoms. Over recent weeks, people have chronicled their symptoms on social media, often in a tone of mordant resignation.",对于许多年轻人来说，感染新冠可能意味着出现一周左右的发烧和其他症状。最近几周，人们已在社交媒体上描述自己的症状，通常用一种听天由命的尖酸口吻。
"More worrisome are older people, many of whom have not had Covid and who may not have received a full round of vaccination shots. Up to three-quarters of Chinese people infected in the recent rise were not infected in the first wave, Dr. Zhang Wenhong, the director of the center for infectious diseases at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai and a major voice in China's response to Covid, said in a recent interview with Chinese media outlets.",更令人担心的是老年人，他们中的许多人还没有感染过新冠病毒，而且也许没有全程接种疫苗。上海华山医院传染病中心主任张文宏医生是中国在新冠病毒问题上最主要的声音之一，他最近接受中国媒体采访时说，在最近这轮疫情中感染病毒的人中，有多达75%的人在第一波疫情中没有被感染。
"Nonetheless, the resurgence in cases ""should not have a huge impact overall on economic activity and life,"" Dr. Zhang said, according to Yicai, a Chinese business newspaper. ""We should not go too far in taking pandemic prevent measures in response.""","尽管如此，据中国商业报纸《第一财经》报道，张文宏表示，新冠病毒卷土重来""对于我们整体的经济生活不应该造成巨大的影响，我们也不应该因此过度采取防疫的措施""。"
"Dong-yan Jin, a professor of virology at the University of Hong Kong who has tracked China's response to Covid, concurred that many of those recently infected were likely to be older or physically frail people who were fenced off from the ""tsunami"" of infections late last year.","香港大学病毒学教授金东雁跟踪过中国对新冠病毒的响应，他同意张文宏的说法，最近这波疫情的感染者许多人很可能是年纪较大或体质不好的人，他们在去年年底的疫情""海啸""中受到保护，没有接触到病毒。"
"""The elderly were well protected in the period of the tsunami, because their families and carers tried their best to protect them,"" Professor Jin said. ""But now, the risks for them are high, because people are less vigilant.""","""老人在疫情海啸中受到了很好的保护，因为他们的家人和护理人员尽了最大努力保护他们，""金东雁说。""但他们现在面临的风险很高，因为人们的戒备已有所放松。"""
"China should increase vaccination rates, especially among old people; upgrade its homegrown vaccine to better protect against new variants; allow the introduction of internationally developed vaccines; and make anti-viral drugs cheaper and more available to Covid patients, Professor Jin said.",金东雁说，中国应提高疫苗接种率，尤其是在老年人中;对国产疫苗进行升级，以更好地抵御新的变异株;允许引进外国研发的疫苗;并让新冠病毒感染者更容易获得更便宜的抗病毒药物。
"""Most people have recognized from their own experience that Covid is not a monster and is not so terrifying, and that's actually positive,"" he said. ""But it is not true that Covid is gone and will never come again, so this message also has to be made clear to the public.""","""大多数人已从自己的经历中认识到，新冠病毒不是怪兽，也不那么可怕，这实际上是好事，""他说。""但新冠病毒已经过去，而且永远不会再回来的说法不对，所以应该将这个信息明确地告诉公众。"""
"The cancellations rippled across the country: A Japanese choral band touring China, stand-up comedy shows in several cities, jazz shows in Beijing. In the span of a few days, the performances were among more than a dozen that were abruptly called off some just minutes before they were supposed to begin with virtually no explanation.",全国各地都出现了演出取消的情况:一个日本僧侣歌手取消了中国巡演，几座城市暂停了脱口秀，北京的酒吧取消了爵士乐。几天的时间里，十几场演出突然被取消，有些是在原定开演时间的几分钟前，而且几乎没有任何解释。
"Just before the performances were scrapped, the authorities in Beijing had fined a Chinese comedy studio around $2 million, after one of its stand-up performers was accused of insulting the Chinese military in a joke; the police in northern China also detained a woman who had defended the comedian online.",这些演出被取消之前，北京有关方面对一家中国喜剧工作室处以1335万人民币的罚款，因为政府指责该工作室的一名脱口秀演员在笑话中侮辱军人;在北方的一座城市，警方还拘留了一名在网上为这名喜剧演员辩护的女子。
"Those penalties, and the sudden spate of cancellations that followed, point to the growing scrutiny of China's already heavily censored creative landscape. China's top leader, Xi Jinping, has made arts and culture a central arena for ideological crackdowns, demanding that artists align their creative ambitions with Chinese Communist Party goals and promote a nationalist vision of Chinese identity. Performers must submit scripts or set lists for vetting, and publications are closely monitored.",这些惩罚以及随之而来的一连串突然取消表明，中国已经受到严格审查的创意领域正在面临越来越严的审查。中国最高领导人习近平已将艺术和文化作为意识形态斗争的主要打击目标，要求艺术家把自己的创作抱负与中国共产党的目标结合起来，推动有利于中国人身份认同的民族主义愿景。表演者必须将剧本或节目单事先提交审查者，各类出版物也受到密切监管。
"On Tuesday, Mr. Xi sent a letter to the National Art Museum of China for its 60th anniversary, reminding staff to ""adhere to the correct political orientation.""","习近平在周二致信中国美术馆庆祝建馆60周年时提醒工作人员""坚持正确政治方向""。"
"Mr. Xi's emphasis on the arts is also part of a broader preoccupation with national security and eliminating supposedly malign foreign influence. The authorities in recent weeks have raided the corporate offices of several Western consulting or advisory companies based in China, and broadened the range of behaviors covered under counterespionage laws.",习近平对艺术的强调是他更广泛地关注国家安全、致力于消除所谓的外国恶劣影响努力的一部分。当局已在最近几周突击搜查了几家西方咨询或顾问公司在中国的办事处，并扩大了反间谍法的适用范围。
Many of the canceled events were supposed to feature foreign performers or speakers.,许多被取消的演出据说都有外国表演者或说唱者参加。
"It was only to be expected that Beijing would also look to the cultural realm, as its deteriorating relationship with the West has made it more fixated on maintaining its grip on power at home, said Zhang Ping, a former journalist and political commentator in China who now lives in Germany.",随着中国与西方的关系不断恶化，政府更异常依赖与维持国内权力有关的控制，把目光投向文化领域是意料之中的事，现居德国、曾在中国担任记者和政治评论员的张平说。
"""One way to respond to anxiety about power is to increase control,"" said Mr. Zhang, who writes under the pen name Chang Ping. ""Dictatorships have always sought to control people's entertainment, speech, laughter and tears.""","""对政权的焦虑，反应之一就是进一步加强控制，""张平(笔名""长平"")说。""一个专政政府，管理人民的文化娱乐，管理说，管理笑，管理哭，都从来如此。"""
"While the party has long regulated the arts one target of the Cultural Revolution was creative work deemed insufficiently ""revolutionary"" the intensity has increased sharply under Mr. Xi. In 2021, a state-backed performing arts association published a list of morality guidelines for artists, which included prescriptions for patriotism. The same year, the government banned ""sissy men"" from appearing on television, accusing them of weakening the nation.","虽然中共长期以来一直对艺术进行控制——被认为不够""革命""曾是创造性作品在文化大革命中受批判的原因——但这种控制的强度已在习近平领导下大增。2021年，有政府背景的中国演出行业协会发布了演艺人员从业规范，其中包括""热爱祖国，拥护党的路线方针政策""的要求。同年，政府禁止了""娘炮""上电视，指责他们削弱了国家。"
"Officials have also taken notice of stand-up comedy, which has gained popularity in recent years and offered a rare medium for limited barbs about life in contemporary China. The government fined a comedian for making jokes about last year's coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai. People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, published a commentary in November that said jokes had to be ""moderate"" and noted that stand-up as an art form was a foreign import; the Chinese name for stand-up, ""tuo kou xiu,"" is itself a transliteration from ""talk show.""","官员们也已开始关注脱口秀，这种表演为有限度地讽刺中国当代生活提供了罕见的平台，近年来已越来越受欢迎。政府曾对一名脱口秀演员处以罚款，因为他拿上海去年的新冠封城开玩笑。中共喉舌《人民日报》去年11月发表的一篇评论文章说，讲笑话要有""适度""，并指出脱口秀作为一种艺术形式是舶来品;脱口秀这个名称本身就是""Talk Show""的音译。"
"The recent crackdown began after an anonymous social media user complained about a set that a popular stand-up comedian, Li Haoshi, performed in Beijing on May 13. Mr. Li, who uses the stage name House, had said that watching his two adopted stray dogs chase a squirrel reminded him of a Chinese military slogan: ""Maintain exemplary conduct, fight to win."" The user suggested that Mr. Li had slanderously compared soldiers to wild dogs.","最近的打击行动始于社交媒体上的一个匿名用户对当红脱口秀演员李昊石今年5月13日在北京一场演出的抱怨。李昊石(艺名House)说，看着他收养的两条流浪狗追松鼠，让他想起了解放军""作风优良，能打胜仗""的口号。该用户暗示，李昊石将解放军比作野狗是侮辱。"
"Outrage grew among nationalist social media users, and the authorities quickly piled on. In addition to fining Xiaoguo Culture Media, the firm that manages Mr. Li, the authorities who said the joke had a ""vile societal impact"" indefinitely suspended the company's performances in Beijing and Shanghai. Xiaoguo fired Mr. Li, and the Beijing police said they were investigating him.","社交媒体上的民族主义用户为此愤怒情绪高涨，当局立即对此事大加挞伐。除了对李昊石的经纪公司笑果文化传媒处以罚款外，还无限期地暂停了该公司在北京和上海的演出，当局称李昊石的笑话造成了""恶劣社会影响""。笑果文化已将他解雇，北京警方表示正在对其进行立案调查。"
"Within hours of the penalty being announced on Wednesday, organizers of stand-up shows in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen and eastern Shandong Province canceled their performances. A few days later, Chinese social media platforms suspended the accounts of Uncle Roger, a Britain-based Malaysian comic whose real name is Nigel Ng; Mr. Ng had posted a video poking fun at the Chinese government on Twitter (which is banned in mainland China).","在上周三宣布处罚后的几小时里，上海、北京、深圳，以及山东省组织脱口秀表演的机构都取消了演出。几天后，中国社交媒体平台暂停了""罗杰叔叔""的账号，""罗杰叔叔""本名黄瑾瑜(Nigel Ng)，是旅居英国的马来西亚喜剧演员，他曾在(被中国大陆禁止的)Twitter上发过一段取笑中国政府的视频。"
"But the apparent fallout was not limited to comedy. Scheduled musical performances began disappearing, too, including a stop in southern China by a Shanghai rock band that includes foreign members, a Beijing folk music festival and several jazz performances, and a Canadian rapper's show in the southern city of Changsha.",但这件事的影响看来不只限于脱口秀表演。原定的音乐表演也开始消失，包括一支有外国成员的上海摇滚乐队在中国南方的演出、北京的一个民间音乐节和几场爵士乐表演，以及一名加拿大说唱歌手在南方城市长沙的演出。
"The frontman of a Buddhist-influenced Japanese chorus group, Kissaquo, said last Wednesday that his concert that night in the southern city of Guangzhou had been canceled. Hours later, the frontman, Kanho Yakushiji, said a performance in Hangzhou, in eastern China, had been canceled, too. And the next day, he announced that Beijing and Shanghai shows had also been called off.","受佛教影响的日本乐队""喫茶去""的主唱上周三说，他定于当晚在南方城市广州举行的音乐会已被取消。几小时后，名为药师寺宽邦的主唱说，在中国东部城市杭州的一场演出也被取消。他在次日宣布，北京和上海的演出也被取消。"
"""I was writing a set list, but I stopped in the middle,"" Mr. Yakushiji, whose management company did not respond to a request for comment, wrote on his Facebook page. ""I still don't understand what the meaning of all this is. I have nothing but regrets.""","""我正在列节目单，但写了一半就停下来了，""药师司宽邦在他的Facebook页面上写道，他的经纪公司没有回复记者的置评请求。""我仍不明白这个事件有什么意义?我现在只感到遗憾。"""
"Organizers' announcements for nearly all of the canceled events cited ""force majeure,"" a term that means circumstances beyond one's control and, in China, has often been used as shorthand for government pressure.","几乎所有取消活动的组织者在公告中都用了""不可抗力""的说法，意思是组织者无法控制的情况，在中国，这个词经常是政府压力的简略表达方式。"
Stand-up show organizers did not return requests for comment. Several organizers of canceled musical performances denied that they had been told not to feature foreigners. An employee at a Nanjing music venue that canceled a tribute to the Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto said not enough tickets had been sold.,脱口秀组织者没有回复记者的置评请求。一些被取消的音乐会的组织者否认他们被要求不许外国表演者参加。南京文化艺术中心已取消了原定举行的坂本龙一经典作品音乐会，该中心的一名员工说，取消的原因是票房不好。
Some of the foreign musicians whose shows were canceled have since been able to perform in other cities or at other venues.,一些被取消了演出的外国音乐家后来能在其他城市或场所演出。
"But a foreign musician in Beijing, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said his band was scheduled to play at a bar on Sunday and was told by the venue several days before that the gig was canceled because featuring foreigners would bring trouble.",但北京的一名外国乐手说，他的乐队原定周日在一家酒吧演出，但在演出的几天前，酒吧告诉他演出已被取消，因为有外国人参加表演会惹麻烦。这名乐手因害怕遭报复，要求不具名。
"Lynette Ong, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Toronto, said it was unlikely that the central government had issued direct instructions to spur the recent cultural crackdowns. Local governments or venue owners, conscious of how the political environment had changed, were likely being especially cautious, she said.",多伦多大学研究中国政治的教授王惠玲(Lynette Ong)说，不太可能是中央政府直接下达的指令引发了最近这轮文化打击。她说，这可能是意识到政治环境发生了变化的地方政府或场地拥有者特别谨慎导致的。
"""In Xi's China, people are so scared and fearful that they become extremely risk-averse,"" she said. ""Overall, it's a very paranoid party.""","""在习近平的中国，人们非常害怕和恐惧，以至于他们变得极度不愿冒险，""她说。""总的来说，中共是一个非常多疑的党。"""
"In the past, when nationalism has gone to extremes, or local officials overzealously enforced the rules, the central government would eventually step in to cool down the rhetoric, in part to preserve economic or diplomatic relationships. But Professor Ong said Beijing's current emphasis on security above all would give it no reason to intervene here.",过去，当民族主义走向极端，或地方官员过于热心地执行规则时，中央政府最终会介入让调子降温，这部分是为了维护经济或外交关系。但王惠玲说，中国政府目前对国家安全的强调高于一切，因此没有理由对这件事进行干预。
"""If people don't watch comedy, there's no loss for the party,"" she said.","""人们不看脱口秀的话，对党来说没有损失，""她说。"
"When cutting foreign technology companies from Chinese supply chains, Beijing has long chosen to work obliquely or even secretly. Regulators would give executives back-room lectures, weigh them down with excessive red tape or hit them with occasional office raids. Rarely did the government tell a firm outright it was no longer welcome.",长期以来，北京在从中国供应链中剔除外国科技公司时，往往选择拐弯抹角甚至暗箱操作的手法。监管机构会在私下训斥高管，用繁文缛节来打压这些公司，或者偶尔对它们的办公地点进行突击搜查。政府很少直接告诉一家公司它不再受欢迎。
But that is what it signaled to Micron Technology in a late-night announcement on Sunday.,但这正是中国政府在周日深夜发布的公告中向美光科技发出的信号。
"The Chinese government barred companies that handle critical information from buying microchips made by the Boise, Idaho-based Micron. The company's chips, which are used for memory storage in all kinds of electronics, like phones and computers, were deemed to pose ""relatively serious cybersecurity problems"" by China's internet watchdog after a review.","中国政府禁止处理关键信息的公司购买总部位于爱达荷州博伊西的美光公司生产的微芯片。该公司的芯片用于手机和电脑等各种电子产品的内存存储，中国互联网监管机构在审查后认为，其构成了""相对严重的网络安全问题""。"
"Micron said it was ""evaluating"" the government's finding and ""assessing"" what it would do next. Analysts said the company, which has been selling chips in China for years, could find itself cut out of future business from Chinese companies.","美光表示正在""评估""政府的调查结果，并在""权衡""下一步行动。分析人士表示，多年来一直在华销售芯片的美光可能会发现，自己未来会被中国公司排除在业务往来之外。"
"The openness and speed with which the Chinese authorities took action against Micron they spent less than two months on the investigation underscore how far apart the two sides are drifting on tech policy. Last year, the Biden administration took harsh steps to block Chinese chip makers' access to crucial tools needed to make advanced chips, as well as access to the chips that run supercomputers and craft powerful artificial intelligence algorithms.",中国当局的调查进行了不到两个月的时间，对美光采取行动的公开性和速度突显出双方在技术政策上的分歧有多大。去年，拜登政府采取严厉措施，阻止中国芯片制造商获得制造先进芯片所需的关键工具，以及运行超级计算机和打造强大人工智能算法的芯片。
"The Micron action, widely seen as a reprisal for those moves, shows some of China's advantages over the United States: a speedy, and feared, authoritarian rule that can quickly pronounce and enforce absolute bans. It also offers a glimpse of new tactics by Beijing.",对美光的禁令被广泛视为对这些行动的报复，该禁令显示了中国相对于美国的一些优势:一个行动迅速且令人恐惧的威权统治，可以快速宣布并实施绝对禁令。禁令还让人得以一窥北京的新策略。
"With the block of Micron, the authorities carved out a space in the industry that Chinese chip makers could fill. The move could also present a new wedge between the United States and its allies, whose companies could make billions of dollars in sales if they were to step in and pick up business that Micron might lose.",通过封杀美光，当局在该行业开辟了一个可以由中国芯片制造商填补的一个空间。此举还可能在美国及其盟友之间制造新的裂痕——如果盟友的公司介入并接手美光可能失去的业务，这些公司可能会获得数十亿美元的销售额。
"For Beijing, hurting an American company that makes critical equipment advances the government's goal of boosting its domestic tech sector.",对北京来说，伤害一家生产关键设备的美国公司有助于推进政府提振国内科技行业的目标。
"""It may not be feasible or necessary to completely replace all products with domestic ones, but for these core products, we need to develop our own capabilities and avoid being overly dependent,"" said Xiang Ligang, a director of a Beijing technology consortium who has advised the Chinese government on technology issues. ""This applies not only to the chip industry but also to other sectors,"" he added.","""完全替代所有的产品可能也做不到也没有必要，但是对于核心的这些产品，我们要发展自己不能变成被卡脖子这样的一个状态，""北京一个技术联盟的负责人项立刚说，他曾为中国政府提供技术问题方面的咨询。他还说:""不仅仅是芯片领域，其他领域可能也都会是这样。"""
"For the better part of a decade, China and the United States have jockeyed over global technological leadership. Chinese computer hacks of American firms, and policies designed to acquire closely held intellectual property, raised red flags in Washington. In Beijing, revelations from Edward J. Snowden, the former U.S. intelligence contractor, exposed the vulnerability in relying too much on American tech.",在过去十年的大部分时间里，中美一直在争夺全球技术领导地位。中国对美国公司发动计算机黑客攻击，以及旨在获取严加保护的知识产权的政策，在华盛顿引起了警惕。而在北京，前美国情报承包商斯诺登的爆料暴露了过度依赖美国技术的脆弱性。
"As each side maneuvered to find new advantages, both came to focus on the semiconductor industry. The tiny microchips that do the thinking for just about all electronics were a convenient choke point for the United States, which worked to cut off China's access to the smallest and fastest chips. The hope was to make China's supercomputers less smart and its smartphones less salable.",双方都想方设法寻找新的优势，均开始关注半导体行业。对美国来说，为几乎所有电子产品提供计算的微型芯片是一个合适的阻塞点，这样就能切断中国获得最小和最快芯片的途径，希望让中国的超级计算机不那么智能，让智能手机不那么畅销。
"To counter Washington, China lavished subsidies on domestic chip leaders. While they failed to catch up to global rivals in the arena of the most advanced chips, some firms succeeded with less sophisticated parts, like memory chips and larger logic chips that work in cheaper smartphones and cars.",为了对抗华盛顿，中国向国内知名芯片商提供大量补贴。虽然他们未能在最先进的芯片领域赶上全球竞争对手，但一些公司在不那么精密的部件领域取得了成功，例如用于更便宜的智能手机和汽车的存储芯片和较大的逻辑芯片。
"Then the Biden administration in October announced a major set of policies aimed at China's most successful semiconductor companies. The move, along with billions in new subsidies for chip production in the United States, were viewed dimly by Chinese policymakers, said Paul Triolo, the senior vice president for China at Albright Stonebridge Group, a strategy advisement firm.",随后，拜登政府于10月宣布了一系列针对中国最成功的半导体公司的重大政策。战略咨询公司奥尔布赖特石桥咨询集团的中国高级副总裁崔奥罗(Paul Triolo)表示，中国决策者对此举以及美国为芯片生产提供数十亿美元的新补贴感到不满。
"""Officials in Beijing over the past months have been complaining to anyone who will listen about U.S. actions,"" he said. ""Beijing views these moves as primarily politically driven and is now willing to go tit for tat,"" Mr. Triolo added.","""过去几个月，北京的官员一直在向愿意倾听的人抱怨美国的行动，""他说。""北京认为这些举措主要是出于政治动机，现在愿意与其针锋相对，""崔奥罗补充道。"
"In some ways, China is better equipped for that exchange. China's authoritarian system enables quick action and guarantees that few domestic firms will break with policy.",从某些方面看，中国更适合这种交锋。中国的威权体制可以迅速行动，并能确保几乎不会有国内企业违背政策。
"In the United States, political debate and legal challenges can dull the sharpness of government efforts. Major American companies, for instance, found legal workarounds to Washington's attempts to cut component sales to companies like the Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei. Some multinationals successfully lobbied for licenses to allow them to keep selling to blacklisted companies.",在美国，政治辩论和法律挑战会削弱政府工作的力度。例如，华盛顿试图削减美国公司向中国电信设备制造商华为等公司的零部件销售，但一些大公司找到了法律上的变通办法。一些跨国公司成功游说获得许可，允许它们继续向列入黑名单的公司销售产品。
"By targeting Micron specifically, China is hitting at one of the few sectors memory chips that it has a toehold in with its chip competition with the United States.",中国通过专门针对美光来打击存储芯片行业，这是它在与美国的芯片竞争中为数不多存在立足之地的行业之一。
"While protecting such success by barring American competitors makes strategic sense, China remains very reliant on the United States for advanced chips, according to Teng Tai, an economist and the director of the Wanbo New Economic Research Institute in Beijing.",北京万博新经济研究院院长、经济学家滕泰表示，尽管通过禁止美国竞争对手来保护这种成功具有战略意义，但中国在先进芯片方面仍然非常依赖美国。
"""The ultimate goal of retaliating against Micron is to urge certain American companies to restrain themselves, so we could further promote technology and trade cooperation, and avoid pursuing an isolated and self-reliant approach,"" he wrote Monday on Weibo, a Chinese social media outlet.","他周一在微博上写道:""打美光的最终目的，还是为了让某些美资企业有所收敛，进一步推动扩大技术和贸易合作，不能关起门来走闭门造车之路。"""
"Another question that Sunday's action against Micron raises is how the United States' ally South Korea will respond. Its companies, in particular Samsung and SK Hynix, have the most to gain from the Micron ban. The two companies stand to pick up customers from Micron, which reported $3.3 billion in sales in China in 2022.",周日针对美光的行动提出了另一个问题，即美国的盟友韩国将如何应对。韩国公司从美光禁令中获益最多——尤其是三星和SK海力士。两家公司将获得美光的客户，据报道，美光2022年在中国的销售额为33亿美元。
"Mr. Xiang, the Chinese government adviser, said: ""Why should South Korea blindly follow the United States and harm its own interests? I don't think South Korea has such an obligation.""","中国政府的顾问项立刚说:""韩国凭什么非要看美国的脸色说，因为你的利益说什么，我也跟着你的一起来损害我的利益嘛，我觉得韩国他也没有这个义务。"""
"The flame-shaped neon archway was visible from miles away, which was good since there was little other reason for anyone to be in that part of town, an expanse of fields outside an industrial city in eastern China. The lights flickered between icy blue and red-hot, leaping toward the night sky beside a jumbo sign: ""Zibo Barbecue Experiential Ground.""","拱门上火焰形状的霓虹灯在几里地外就能看到，这有用，因为游客几乎没有其他理由来这个地方，这里是中国东部一座工业城市郊外的一片广阔田野。灯光在冰冷的蓝色和炽热的红色之间摇曳，像火焰般跃向夜空，旁边有一个巨大横幅:""淄博烧烤体验地""。"
"And what an experience awaited. Inside this Coachella for barbecue, visitors could pose with a mascot dressed like a meat skewer. They could watch a concert against an LED backdrop of radiating flames. They could eat from one of the hundreds of grills scattered across the grounds the size of 12 football fields if they waited hours for a table, and if their chosen meat purveyor hadn't run out of food.",这将是一种怎样的体验啊。在这个烧烤节上，游客可以与外形像烤肉串的吉祥物合影，可以在背景是用LED灯构成的辐射状火焰的舞台前观看音乐会。在这个面积相当于12个足球场的空地上，他们可以从数百个烧烤摊上挑选吃的东西——如果他们等了几个小时后终于有了一张桌子，而且烧烤摊还没有卖光他们想吃的肉的话。
"Zibo, a once-obscure chemical manufacturing city in Shandong Province, has suddenly strangely thanks to, of all things, barbecue turned into China's hottest tourist destination.",淄博曾是山东一座默默无闻的化工城市，突然之间，它竟然靠烧烤不可思议地变成了中国最热门的旅游目的地。
"This city of 4.7 million received 4.8 million visitors in March, after it began attracting notice on social media. During a public holiday earlier this month, a Zibo vegetable market was more popular than the Great Wall, according to a mapping service. High-speed rail tickets from Beijing sold out one minute after their release.",在社交媒体上走红后，这座有470万人口的城市今年3月迎来了480万游客。在本月初的五一长假期间，淄博一家菜市场里的人比长城上的还多，据一家地图服务公司的数据。北京到淄博的高铁车票开售一分钟即售罄。
"The local government has set up 21 buses to ferry visitors from the train station directly to barbecue restaurants. They erected the barbecue festival on the site of a sprawling seafood market, the only place big enough to host 10,000 people.",当地政府安排了21辆公交车，将游客从火车站直接送到烧烤店。他们用一个巨大的海鲜市场来举办烧烤节，那是唯一能容纳一万人的地方。
"""We've all had good food before, but this kind of hustle and bustle, this warmth, is hard to find,"" said Zhang Kexin, a college senior who, within half an hour of arriving in Zibo during the recent holiday, bought six souvenir tubs of pan-fried crackers, another local specialty.","""现在好吃的好喝的大家都享受过了，体验过了，但是这种烟火气的，人情味的，感觉现在很少了，""目前读大四的学生张可馨(音)说，她在最近的五一假期来到淄博，刚到半小时，就买了六盒锅饼作为纪念品，这是当地的另一种特产。"
"Ms. Zhang had traveled 500 miles from Shanxi Province not a journey she had ever considered before, though Zibo was a friend's hometown. ""I thought it seemed like a very ordinary place,"" she laughed.","张可馨来自800公里外的山西，她以前从未考虑过来这里，尽管一个朋友的老家在淄博。这里""很普通的，我以前感觉，""她笑着说。"
"The question of why, exactly, this ordinary place took off has absorbed seemingly all of China, with officials in other cities even sending research teams to Zibo to try and emulate its success. Most explanations attribute the craze's origins to college students, some of whom posted on social media about the joys of the local barbecue style. Diners grill their own skewers on tabletop charcoal stoves, which lends the meal a D.I.Y. feel, and wrap them in a local specialty of tortilla-like shells, alongside a sprig of raw green onion and a smear of hot sauce.",这个普通的地方究竟为何突然大受欢迎，这个问题似乎吸引了整个中国，为了复制该市的成功，其他城市的官员甚至派调研组前往淄博实地考察。大多数的解释将这种疯狂的起源归因于大学生，一些学生在社交媒体上发帖，介绍当地烧烤风格的乐趣。要吃烧烤的话，得用餐桌上的木炭炉自己动手烤，然后将烤好的食物裹在当地特产的薄饼里，配上一小撮生葱和一抹辣酱，给吃烧烤添加了一点DIY的感觉。
The cheap prices were also a draw skewers startat 15 cents at the most popular restaurants so other young people began flocking to town. Influencers followed.,价格便宜也是吸引人的原因——最火的餐馆里最便宜的烤串只要一块钱。其他年轻人蜂拥而至。网红们紧随其后。
"But perhaps most crucial has been the very fact of how unexpected Zibo's rise was. As a result, locals seeminglyunable to believe their luck have done all they can to keep the frenzy alive.",但淄博走红多么出乎意料这个事实本身也许才是最关键的。结果是，似乎无法相信自己运气的当地人已在竭尽全力让这种狂热持续下去。
"Residents have offered their homes to strangers who couldn't find hotels. After some social media users joked that they wanted eye candy with their barbecue, officials organized a ""180 group"" men taller than 180 centimeters, or 5 feet 11 inches, and wearing suits to greet train station arrivals.","居民们把自己的房子提供给找不到旅馆的陌生人。一些社交媒体用户开玩笑说想找帅哥陪同吃烧烤后，官员们组织了一个""180天团""，派身高1米8以上的男子穿着西装去火车站迎接游客。"
"At the station during the May 1 holiday, there were no suited men in sight. But there were plenty of other cheery greeters, handing out water bottles, sunscreen, watermelon (grown in a Zibo suburb), mouthwash (for after barbecue), even flasks of localliquor.",虽然五一长假期间，没有在火车站外看到身穿西服的男子，但有许多其他热情的欢迎者，他们向游客分发瓶装水、防晒霜、(淄博郊区种植的)西瓜、(吃烧烤后用的)漱口水，甚至还有小瓶的当地白酒。
"""Welcome, out-of-town visitors! I hope you have fun!"" a woman shouted as she pressed pumpkin-flavored crackers into arrivals' hands, many of which were already overflowing with freebies.","""欢迎外地游客!希望你们玩得开心!""一名女子一边高喊，一边将南瓜味的饼干递给到达者，许多游客手中已拿满了免费赠品。"
"For many visitors, the crazy crowds are the point, after China's prolonged Covid lockdowns. At one of the most popular barbecue restaurants, where hundreds of diners perched on tiny folding stools around outdoor grills, officials had designated an elevated viewing platform just for tourists to watch the people below eat, through a cloud of cumin-scented smoke.","中国实行了长达三年的""新冠清零""政策后，许多游客是奔着疯狂的人群而来。在一家最火的烧烤店里，数百名食客坐在户外烤架周围的小马扎上，官员们指定一个高架观景平台专供游客透过一团团孜然味的烟雾，观看下方的饕餮盛况。"
"Li Yang, a local, snagged a table around 6 p.m., after having lined up at 3 a.m. His commute to his job at a steel company was now clogged with traffic. But he didn't mind.",当地人李阳凌晨3点就来排队，终于在下午6点左右等到了一张桌子。虽然他去一家钢铁公司上班的路上现在挤满了车，但他并不介意。
"""To see all this liveliness, after three years of the pandemic, my heart feels pretty warm,"" he shouted, over the sounds of maracasshaken by four men, seemingly unaffiliated with the restaurant, who were gallivanting between tables serenading diners.","""多了这么多人气，跟疫情这三年来比的话，说实话，心里还是挺暖的，""他大声说道，声音几乎被四名摇着沙锤的男子制造的声音淹没，这四名男子似乎与餐厅无关，他们在餐桌之间为食客演奏。"
"Several tables away, Bai Lingbin, 25, was already digging in, having waited since midnight. His grill, shared with four other men, was piled withtoothpick-thin skewers laced with crispy pork skin, sweet potatoes and wraps.",几张桌子外，现年25岁的白灵斌(音)已经开吃，他午夜刚过就来等座。他与其他四名男子共用一个烤架，食物串在牙签一般细的扦子上，有酥脆的猪皮和红薯，还有卷饼。
"Mr. Bai, who had traveled from Anhui Province, wasfrank: He prefers the barbecue in northeastern China, another famous grilling region. But, he declared as he raised a beer to his table mates, whom he'd met in line: ""The atmosphere here is the best.""","来自安徽的白灵斌坦言:他更喜欢东北烧烤，那是中国另一个以烧烤闻名的地区。但当他向排队时遇到的同桌们举起啤酒杯时，他宣称:""但是所有氛围是吃烧烤中最好的，就是这种热情。"""
"Still, some locals secretly profess a desire to see their hometown's sudden fame ebb, at least a little.",尽管如此，一些当地人私下表示，希望看到自己的家乡突如其来的名气消退下去，至少不要像现在这么火。
"Staff at barbecue restaurants said they were sleeping only a few hours each night. Residents who used to buy groceries at the suddenly popular vegetable market where there is now nary a vegetable in sight, as snack and souvenir vendors have piled in must find their produce elsewhere.",烧烤店的工作人员说，他们每天晚上只能睡几小时。那个突然走红的菜市场现在看不到蔬菜，里面都是卖小吃和纪念品的摊位，当地民众只得去别处找他们需要的东西。
"There was intense pressure to keep customers happy, though, because the government was determined to maintain Zibo's streak, said Wang Jiuyuan, the manager of a barbecue spot a 30-minute drive from the city center, yet still overrun. Mr. Wang had pasted posters at every table, asking customers for patience because many waiters spoke only the local dialect.",因为政府已下决心保持淄博的运气，商贩们让顾客满意的压力很大，一家距离市中心有30分钟车程的烧烤店的经理王九元(音)说，虽然他的店地点有点偏，但仍人满为患。王先生在每张桌子傍贴了海报，请求顾客保持耐心，因为很多服务员只会说当地方言。
"""We're afraid of having a complaint filed against us, because as long as it's an out-of-town customer, the government will accept it, whether it's reasonable or not,"" Mr. Wang said, adding that the restaurant had been scolded after a customer complained about not being seated.","王九元表示，""我们也害怕投诉。淄博政府只要是外地顾客，不管是什么都受理，不管占不占理都受理。""他还说，一名顾客抱怨没有座位后，他的店已挨了一顿骂。"
"Some online have worried that the pressure on locals to be accommodating has gone too far, especially after a viral video showed one restaurant owner kneeling to ask forgiveness from a customer upset by long lines.",网上有些人担心，要求当地人为游客提供方便的压力已经过大，尤其是在一段视频在网上疯传之后，视频显示一名餐厅老板跪着向一名顾客请求原谅，该顾客因排队时间太长发了脾气。
"Last month, even the Zibo government seemed to pull back, urging people to visit other nearby cities, because it was overwhelmed.",上个月，就连淄博市政府似乎也打起了退堂鼓，因为当地的游客太多了，政府鼓励人们去附近其他地方玩。
"Down a quiet road on the outskirts of the city, workers in aging factories were kneading handmade sesame crisps, a local delicacy that had also seen a boost in orders as tourists poured in, said Gao Juan, a factory owner.",淄博郊外一条安静的马路边上，一家老旧工厂的工人们正在揉制手工制作的周村烧饼，这也是一种当地美食，工厂老板高娟说，随着游客的涌入，订单量也在增加。
"Ms. Gao had considered pivoting to making the barbecue wraps, which were in even higher demand. Vendors of those wraps were already taking orders for August.",高娟曾考虑过改为生产卷烧烤用的薄饼，因为需求量更大。薄饼供应商们已经在接受今年8月份的订单。
But the machines for making those wraps were sold out. Ms. Gao was willing to takea long view about whetherthe craze would last.,但是制作薄饼的机器已经售罄。高娟愿意用一个长远眼光来考虑烧烤热是否会持续下去的问题。
"""When there's a shortage in the market, it's easy to overreact,"" she said. ""Let's wait and see.""","""市场缺的时候容易爆满、过量，""她说。""先看看。"""
"Beijing on Sunday told Chinese companies that deal with critical information to stop purchasing products from Micron Technology, the U.S.-based manufacturer of memory chips used in phones, computers and other electronics. Many analysts viewed the move as retaliation for Washington's efforts to cut off China's access to high-end chips.",周日，北京要求处理关键信息的中国公司停止购买美光科技的产品。美光科技是一家总部位于美国的内存芯片制造商，产品用于手机、电脑和其他电子设备。许多分析人士认为，此举是对华盛顿切断中国获得高端芯片渠道的报复。
"In a statement on its official social media site, the Cyberspace Administration of China said that in a cybersecurity review it had found that the chip maker's products posed ""relatively serious cybersecurity problems."" The problems could ""seriously endanger the supply chain of China's critical information infrastructure"" and threaten national security, it said.","中国国家互联网信息办公室在官方的社交媒体帐户上发表声明称，经过网络安全审查，发现该芯片制造商的产品存在""较严重网络安全隐患""。报告称，这些问题可能""对我国关键信息基础设施供应链造成重大安全风险""，并威胁国家安全。"
China's action is the latest volley in an economic tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington that is rearranging the fabric of a sprawling global microchip industry. The decision to bar Micron from selling its chips to key companies could have a ripple effect through China's supply chains as Micron's Chinese customers seek to replace the U.S. memory chips with homegrown or Korean versions. South Korean chip makers like Samsung and SK Hynix are Micron's competitors and already do significant business with China.,中国的行动是北京和华盛顿之间经济对峙的最新一击，这种对峙正在对庞大的全球微芯片产业进行大洗牌。随着美光的中国客户寻求用国产或韩国的内存芯片取代美国芯片，禁令可能会在中国供应链中产生连锁反应。三星和SK海力士等韩国芯片制造商是美光的竞争对手，它们在中国已经有大量业务。
"Beijing initiated a cybersecurity review of Micron in late March as part of what it called a ""normal regulatory measure."" The announcement came after Washington rolled out restrictions in October against China's semiconductor industry. Micron said at the time that it was ""cooperating fully"" with the investigation and that its China business was operating as normal.","北京在3月底启动针对美光的网络安全审查，作为其所谓的""正常监管措施""的一部分。这一声明是在华盛顿10月份对中国半导体产业实施限制之后发布的。美光当时表示，该公司正""全力配合""调查，其在华业务运作正常。"
"In a statement, the company said it was ""evaluating the conclusion and assessing our next steps,"" adding that it was ""continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities.""","该公司在一份声明中表示，它正在""评估结论，并评估我们的下一步行动""，并说，它正在""继续与中国当局进行讨论""。"
"Since the announcement in March, China has been engaged in an all-out campaign to shore up its homegrown chip industry. Beijing has spent billions of dollars on the efforts at self-reliance and Chinese companies up and down the supply chain have moved to replace Western chips and parts.",自3月宣布这一消息以来，中国一直在全力支持其本土芯片产业。北京自力更生的努力花费了数十亿美元，供应链上的西方芯片和零部件已经为中国公司的产品所取代。
"The Chinese authorities offered few clues about what they had discovered that posed serious risks. They have also provided little information about what is required of companies during a cybersecurity review. But Graham Webster, the editor in chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center, said that among the risks was the potential for further sanctions by Washington that could cut off important Chinese companies from Micron's memory chips.",究竟是什么构成了严重风险，中国当局几乎没有提供任何线索。他们也没有提供多少信息来说明网络安全审查期间对公司要求。但斯坦福大学网络政策中心数字中国项目的主编魏光明(Graham Webster)表示，风险之一是华盛顿可能进一步采取制裁，切断中国重要企业获得美光内存芯片的渠道。
"""Supply-chain security includes the risk of a foreign government cutting off supply, which the U.S. government has done in multiple ways for other semiconductors,"" Mr. Webster said. He added that China's decision may have been partly a ""derisking measure to avoid further reliance on supplies the U.S. might cut off.""","魏光明说，""供应链安全包括外国政府切断供应的风险，美国政府已经以多种方式对其他半导体进行了切断。""他还说，中国的决定可能在一定程度上是一种""规避风险的措施，以避免进一步依赖美国可能切断的供应""。"
"Washington has urged South Korean officials to prevent its chip makers from filling the market void if Micron was unable to sell its chips to China, The Financial Times reported in April.",《金融时报》4月报道，华盛顿已敦促韩国官员，如果美光无法向中国出售芯片，则应阻止韩国的芯片制造商填补市场空白。
"China approved a cybersecurity law in 2016 that outlined rules to safeguard what it called ""critical information infrastructure,"" which refers to technology systems in sectors including telecommunications, transportation and defense that Chinese regulators believe would be vulnerable if they malfunctioned or leaked data.","2016年，中国通过了一项网络安全法，概述了保护其所谓的""关键信息基础设施""的规则，这些设施包括电信、交通和国防等行业的技术系统，中国监管机构认为，如果这些系统发生故障或泄露数据，它们很容易受到攻击。"
"Micron, which is based in Boise, Idaho, built its first factory in China in 2007. In recent years as relations between the United States and China cooled, it has begun to downsize its operations, reducing the number of Chinese staff and shutting down some operations. As of April, it had about 3,000 employees in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen.",总部位于爱达荷州博伊西的美光于2007年在中国建立了第一家工厂。近年来，随着中美关系降温，该公司开始缩减业务规模，减少中国员工的数量，并关闭了一些业务。截至今年4月，该公司在上海、北京和深圳拥有约3000名员工。
"The impact of Sunday's decision on the company could be sizable. In 2022, Micron reported $3.3 billion in sales in China, roughly 11 percent of its annual $30.8 billion in global sales. It was unclear how much of those sales in China would be affected by the government's action.",周日的决定对该公司的影响可能相当大。2022年，美光在中国的销售额为33亿美元，约占其全球308亿美元年销售额的11%。目前还不清楚在中国的销售中有多少会受到政府行动的影响。
"China's most senior diplomat to visit Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began has finished talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials, with no apparent breakthrough in Beijing's efforts to promote a cease-fire.",自俄罗斯全面入侵乌克兰以来，中国访乌的最高级别外交官结束了与泽连斯基总统和其他官员的会谈，北京推动停火的努力没有取得明显进展。
"The Chinese diplomat, Li Hui, instead played down the prospects of a sudden shift, according to an official summary of his meetings in Ukraine released by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday. Mr. Li met with Mr. Zelensky; Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba; and other officials in Kyiv over the previous two days, the summary said.",根据中国外交部周四公布的会谈纪要，中国外交官李辉反而淡化了局势出现突然转变的可能性。纪要表示，此前两天的基辅之行中，李辉会见了泽连斯基和乌克兰外长库列巴及乌方其他官员。
"""There is no magical remedy for defusing the crisis,"" Mr. Li said, according to the Chinese summary. ""This needs all the parties to start from themselves, build up mutual trust and create the conditions for cessation of war and for peace talks.""","""化解危机没有灵丹妙药，""根据中方的会谈纪要，李辉表示。""需要各方从自身做起，积累互信，创造止战和谈条件。"""
"Mr. Li's visit to Ukraine was part of a tour across Europe to promote Beijing's potential role in ending the war. He is scheduled to travel on to Poland, France, Germany and Russia ""for communication on a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said last week. Mr. Li, a former ambassador to Moscow whose official title is special representative on Eurasian affairs, has been promoting a broad, 12-point framework issued by Beijing in February as a starting point for peace efforts.","除了乌克兰，李辉还将访问欧洲，宣传中国在停战问题上可能发挥的作用。中国外交部上周表示，他还计划前往波兰、法国、德国和俄罗斯，""就政治解决乌克兰危机同各方进行沟通""。李辉曾任中国驻俄罗斯大使，目前的官方职务是欧亚事务特别代表，他一直在推动中国今年2月发布的内容空泛的12条原则框架，以此作为实现和平的起点。"
But neither the Chinese nor the Ukrainian account of Mr. Li's talks in Ukraine gave any sign that Beijing's global influence has narrowed the gulf between Kyiv and Moscow.,但在中乌双方对李辉在乌会谈的描述中，均未显示出任何迹象表明中国的全球影响力缩小了乌克兰与俄罗斯之间的鸿沟。
"Ukraine has been wary of Chinese declarations about its role as a potential peace broker because Beijing is close to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. Even now, more than a year into the fighting, Chinese officials generally avoid using the words war or invasion to describe the conflict.",由于中国与俄罗斯及其总统普京交好，乌克兰对中国可能扮演和平斡旋者的说法一直抱持谨慎态度。即便战斗目前已持续一年多，中国官员往往还是避免使用战争或入侵的字眼来描述这场冲突。
"Other international leaders have also stepped forward as potential brokers to help end the war, including the presidents of France and Brazil, as well as Pope Francis. But both Moscow and Kyiv appear to be focused on making gains in fighting over the coming months before considering their positions in any talks.",其他国际领导人也为结束这场战争挺身而出，成为可能的斡旋者，其中包括法国和巴西总统，以及教皇方济各。但俄乌双方似乎都专注于在未来数月的战场上取得进展，而不是考虑他们在任何谈判中将持何种立场。
"Mr. Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, told Mr. Li that Kyiv ""does not accept any proposals involving the loss of territory or the freezing of the conflict,"" according to a statement from the Ukrainian ministry on Wednesday. It added that Mr. Kuleba had suggested China support Ukraine's peace plan, which calls for Russia to withdraw from all Ukrainian territory.","乌克兰外交部在周三的声明中表示，乌克兰外长库列巴向李辉表示，基辅""不接受任何涉及丧失领土或冻结冲突的提议""。声明还指出，库列巴建议中方支持乌克兰提出的和平方案，该方案要求俄罗斯从乌克兰所有领土撤军。"
"Still, Mr. Li's tour also appears to be aimed at blunting European criticism that China has put preserving its relationship with Russia ahead of its concern for Ukraine's sovereignty and its wartime casualties.",尽管如此，李辉此行似乎也是为了平息欧洲的批评，即中国将维护对俄关系置于对乌克兰主权及战时伤亡的关切之上。
"Mr. Li's role in seeking to end the war was announced last month, shortly after China's leader, Xi Jinping, held his first phone call with Mr. Zelensky since Russia began its invasion last year.",上个月，在中国领导人习近平与泽连斯基进行了自俄罗斯去年入侵以来的首次通话后不久，中国任命李辉调停俄乌冲突。
"China, Mr. Li told his Ukrainian hosts this week, wants to ""encourage the international community to form the greatest common denominator toward defusing the Ukraine crisis,"" the official Chinese summary of the talks said. ""China has always played a constructive role in its own way in easing the humanitarian situation of Ukrainians.""","李辉本周向乌克兰东道主表示，中方愿""推动国际社会形成解决乌克兰危机的最大公约数""，中国官方的会谈纪要中写道。""中方一直以自己的方式为缓解乌人道局势发挥建设性作用。"""
"China's leader, Xi Jinping, is kicking off a summit on Thursday that the country is heralding as a historic milestone, rolling out the red carpet for five Central Asian countries that are critical to China's regional ambitions.",中国领导人习近平将于周四拉开一场峰会的序幕，该国将此次峰会视为一个历史性的里程碑，热烈迎接对中国的地区雄心至关重要的五个中亚国家。
"The inaugural China-Central Asia summit is part of China's broader aim to strengthen economic and political partnerships with like-minded countries, to counter what it sees as a U.S.-dominated world order that is trying to contain and suppress China.",首届中国-中亚峰会是中国更广泛目标的一部分，目的是加强与志同道合国家的经济和政治伙伴关系，以对抗美国主导的世界秩序，中国认为该秩序正在努力遏制、打压它。
"Notably, Mr. Xi's summit was scheduled on the eve of the annual Group of 7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which begins Friday and will be attended by leaders of the world's wealthiest large democracies, including President Biden. A major topic for the G7 leaders will be how to address what the United States describes as China's growing assertiveness.",值得注意的是，习近平的峰会将在七国集团年度峰会前一天召开，后者将于周五在日本广岛举行，届时世界上最富有的大型民主国家的领导人将出席此次峰会，包括拜登总统。七国集团领导人的一个主要议题将是如何应对美国所说的中国日益强硬的姿态。
"Mr. Xi has sought to deepen China's influence in Central Asia, part of his efforts to burnish his image as a global statesman. China greeted the leaders of five former Soviet republics Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on the tarmac with a huge crowd of dancers and jumping children chanting: ""Welcome, welcome! Warmly welcome!""","习近平一直在寻求深化中国在中亚的影响力，这是他努力提升自己作为全球政治家形象的一部分。中国在停机坪上迎接五个前苏联加盟共和国——哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、土库曼斯坦和乌兹别克斯坦——的领导人，一大群舞者和蹦蹦跳跳的孩子高呼:""欢迎，欢迎!热烈欢迎!"""
"The two-day summit also points to China's interest in filling some of the void left by Russia, a key trading partner and longtime security provider for the region. Russia's war in Ukraine has weakened Moscow's influence in Central Asia, creating an opening for China.",为期两天的峰会还表明中国有兴趣填补俄罗斯留下的一些空白，俄罗斯是该地区的主要贸易伙伴和长期安全提供者。俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争削弱了莫斯科在中亚的影响力，为中国创造了机会。
"""China has been trying to highlight more and more of these groupings and platforms where it is the center point, not the West,"" said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. ""It's part of the wider story that China is spinning, which is that there's another world order out there.""","""中国一直在努力强调越来越多地以它为中心的团体和平台，而不是以西方为中心，""新加坡拉惹勒南国际研究院高级研究员潘睿凡(Raffaello Pantucci)说。""这是中国正在广泛宣传的叙事的一部分，即世上有另一个世界秩序。"""
"In a symbolic move, the summit is taking place in Xi'an, the city in central China that was a key stop on the ancient Silk Road trade route, which for centuries linked China with Central Asia and the Middle East.",具有象征意义的是，峰会在西安举行，这是古代贸易路线丝绸之路上的重要一站，数百年来，这条贸易路线将中国与中亚和中东联系在一起。
"Articles from Chinese state media outlets have hyped up anticipation for the meeting, describing it as a milestone in Chinese diplomacy and a ""new model"" in international relations. China's foreign ministry called it the first major diplomatic event hosted by the country this year.","中国的官媒发文夸大对此次会晤的期待，将其描述为中国外交的里程碑和国际关系的""新模式""。中国外交部称这是今年中国主办的首场重大外交活动。"
"China's interest in Central Asia stems from longstanding concerns about violence and ethnic tensions in the country's far western region of Xinjiang, which shares a border with Central Asian countries. China sees economic prosperity in the region as a way to further stabilize Xinjiang, analysts say.",中国对中亚的兴趣源于长期以来对中国西部偏远地区新疆的暴力和种族紧张局势的担忧，该地区与中亚国家接壤。分析人士说，中国将该地区的经济繁荣视为进一步稳定新疆的一种方式。
"China has invested billions of dollars into the pipelines, highways and railways that help bring Central Asia's rich reserve of natural resources into China. Many Chinese cities rely on natural gas from Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan has some of the world's largest oil fields outside the Middle East.",中国已投资数十亿美元建设管道、公路和铁路，帮助将中亚丰富的自然资源储备带入中国。许多中国城市依赖土库曼斯坦的天然气，而哈萨克斯坦拥有一些中东以外世界上最大的油田。
"In 2013, Mr. Xi chose Kazakhstan as the site of the speech where he outlined the vision for his Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion plan to build infrastructure projects in developing countries to draw them closer to China's orbit. Last year, Mr. Xi visited Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan for his first overseas trip since the pandemic started.","2013年，习近平选择哈萨克斯坦作为演讲地点，在那里概述了""一带一路""倡议的愿景，这是一项价值1万亿美元的计划，在发展中国家建设基础设施项目，以将其纳入中国的影响范围。去年，习近平访问了乌兹别克斯坦和哈萨克斯坦，那是他自疫情开始以来的首次出访。"
"Still, the relationship has not always been smooth. Several Belt and Road projects in the region have stalled or been embroiled in scandal, including a power plant breakdown in 2018 that left much of Kyrgyzstan's capital without heat or electricity. Local residents have protested over concerns that their countries are becoming too indebted to China, and over China's internment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.","尽管如此，这种关系并不总是一帆风顺。该地区的几个""一带一路""项目已经陷入停滞或卷入丑闻，包括2018年吉尔吉斯斯坦的一座发电厂故障导致该国首都大部分地区断供暖断电。当地居民抗议他们的国家对中国的负债过高，以及中国在新疆拘禁穆斯林少数民族。"
"And Mr. Xi's ambitions in the region are complicated by his friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and by the two countries' close ties. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, has unnerved Central Asia, stirring concerns that Russia could try to seize other places formerly part of the Soviet Union, or encourage separatists.",习近平与俄罗斯总统普京的友谊加上两国的密切关系令他在该地区的雄心变得复杂。俄罗斯入侵前苏联加盟共和国乌克兰令中亚感到不安，引发人们对俄罗斯可能会试图夺取前苏联的其他地区或鼓励分离主义分子的担忧。
"Theresa Fallon, director of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels, said China is engaged in a ""tough diplomatic tap dance"" of trying to gain an edge with Central Asian countries without angering Mr. Putin.","位于布鲁塞尔的俄罗斯欧亚研究中心主任特蕾莎·法伦表示，中国正在进行一场""艰难的外交踢踏舞""，试图在不激怒普京的情况下在中亚国家获得优势。"
"""China and Russia share an anti-Western narrative, but there are many areas of potential friction,"" Ms. Fallon said.","""中俄有着共同的反西方叙事，但也有许多领域存在潜在摩擦，""法伦说。"

"Beijing fined a Chinese comedy studio around $2 million on Wednesday for a joke that compared China's military to stray dogs, a reminder of the ever-narrowing confines of expression under the country's leader, Xi Jinping.",周三，北京对一家中国喜剧工作室处以1335万人民币的罚款，因为它在一个段子中将中国军队和流浪狗相提并论，这提醒人们，言论表达的范围在国家领导人习近平的领导下不断缩小。
"The Beijing Municipal Culture and Tourism Bureau accused a popular comedian, Li Haoshi, who is employed by the studio, of ""severely insulting"" the People's Liberation Army, China's military, during two live performances in Beijing on Saturday. The authority said his joke had a ""vile societal impact.""","北京市文化和旅游局指责该工作室雇用的当红喜剧演员李昊石周六在北京的两场现场表演中""严重侮辱""中国人民解放军。当局称他的笑话造成了""恶劣社会影响""。"
"""We will not allow any company or individual to wantonly slander the glorious image of the People's Liberation Army,"" the statement read.","""我们绝不允许任何公司和个人在首都舞台肆意诋毁人民军队的光辉形象，""声明写道。"
"The authority also said it indefinitely suspended all Beijing performances hosted by the studio, Shanghai-based Xiaoguo Culture Media. The bureau also confiscated roughly $180,000 worth of what officials described as illicit income uncovered during the investigation, which was launched on Monday. Officials in Shanghai followed suit, suspending all Xiaoguo performances there and ordering the company to ""deeply reflect"" on the lessons from the incident, according to a government social media account.","当局还表示已无限期暂停笑果文化传媒公司在北京主办的所有演出，该公司总部位于上海。北京文旅局还没收了当局在开始的调查中所称的""违法所得""132.5万元人民币。据政府社交媒体帐号称，上海的官员也紧随其后，暂停了笑果在那里的所有演出，并责令该公司""深刻反思""事件的教训。"
"The investigation was launched after a recording of Mr. Li's joke was posted on social media. In it, Mr. Li was describing a scene in which his two adopted stray dogs were chasing a squirrel. The ferocity of the dogs' pursuit, he said, reminded him of a well-known Chinese military slogan about virtue and grit: ""Maintain exemplary conduct, fight to win.""","调查是在李昊石的脱口秀视频被人发到社交媒体上后启动的。视频中，李昊石讲述他收养的两只流浪狗追逐一只松鼠的场景。他说，狗的凶猛追击让他想起了中国军队一句关于品德和毅力的著名口号:""作风优良，能打胜仗。"""
"Mr. Xi had used the slogan in a political meeting with a military delegation in 2013, shortly after coming to power, and the phrase has since been popularized.",2013年上台后不久，习近平在人大会出席解放军代表团会议时使用了这个口号，此后该口号广为人知。
"The joke spread widely on Chinese social media, after critics, especially nationalist commentators, argued that the comedian had poked fun at what had been a serious speech delivered by Mr. Xi. Others said that Mr. Li's words had been taken out of context.",在批评人士——尤其是民族主义评论员——认为这位喜剧演员是在拿习近平发表的严肃讲话开玩笑后，该笑话在中国社交媒体上广泛传播。也有人说，李昊石的话被断章取意了。
"The stiff penalty dealt a heavy blow to China's nascent standup comedy scene, highlighting the high-wire act comedians walk in China, where the boundaries of speech are constantly tightening. Officials in China often expect films and artwork to deliver a positive moral impact on society, a view that dates back to the era of Mao Zedong and the role of art as an instrument of politics. The Beijing authority, in announcing the punishment against Xiaoguo, urged artists and writers to have ""correct creative thinking"" and ""provide healthy spiritual nourishment for the people.""","严厉的处罚对中国新生的脱口秀行业是一次沉重打击，突显了喜剧演员在中国表演犹如走钢丝，那里的言论边界在不断收紧。中国官员往往期望电影和艺术品能够对社会产生积极的道德影响，这种观点可以追溯到毛泽东时代，艺术被当作政治工具。北京当局在宣布对笑果的处罚时，敦促艺术家和作家要""端正创作思想""，""为人民群众提供有营养的精神食粮""。"
"In recent years, Mr. Xi has stepped up controls on speech that challenges the party's narratives around politics and Chinese history.",近年来，习近平加强力度控制在政治和中国历史方面挑战共产党叙述的言论。
"Last year, Luo Changping, a businessman and former investigative journalist in China, was sentenced to prison for seven months after he questioned China's role in the Korean War. Mr. Luo was charged under a new criminal code that makes the defamation of political martyrs a crime.",去年，商人、前中国调查记者罗昌平因质疑中国在朝鲜战争中的作用而被判入狱七个月。依据新刑法，罗昌平被起诉，该法将诽谤政治烈士定为犯罪。
"Recently, in addition to traditional Chinese forms of comedy, the Western variety of standup has grown more popular in metropolitan cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. The art form reached mainstream prominence due, in part, to the success of Rock and Roast, a standup competition that drew millions of fans during the pandemic, when lockdowns confined many Chinese to their home. The show, run by Xiaoguo, turned Mr. Li, who goes by the stage name ""House,"" into a star.","最近，除了中国传统的喜剧形式外，西方脱口秀在上海和北京等大都市也越来越受欢迎。这种艺术形式之所以成为主流，部分源于《脱口秀大会》的成功，这是一个单口喜剧比赛，在大流行期间吸引了数百万粉丝，当时许多中国人因疫情封锁被限制在家中。这个由笑果运营的节目让艺名""House""的李昊石成为了明星。"
"""There's an inherent tension between standup comedy as a genre and the heavily censored cultural domain in China,"" said Sheng Zou, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who specializes in popular culture in China.","""作为一种流派，脱口秀与中国受到严格审查的文化领域之间必然存在紧张关系，""专门研究中国流行文化的香港浸会大学助理教授邹胜说。"
"Comedy thrives in places where comedians can satirize or comment on political or ideological tropes. But in China, Mr. Zou said, ""you have a very limited set of options for what kinds of material you can draw on.""","在喜剧演员可以讽刺、评论政治或意识形态比喻的地方，喜剧才会蓬勃发展。但在中国，邹胜说，""对于可以取材的材料种类，你的选择非常有限。"""
"Mr. Li was suspended indefinitely by Xiaoguo immediately following the performance, according to a statement by the comedy company on Monday. In an earlier Weibo post, the comedian said he was ""deeply ashamed and regretful,"" calling his comparison ""very inappropriate.""","根据笑果周一的一份声明，表演结束后，李昊石立即被该喜剧公司无限期停职。在早些时候的微博帖子中，这位喜剧演员表示他""深感羞愧与后悔""，称他的比喻""非常不恰当""。"
Mr. Li and Xiaoguo could not immediately be reached for comment.,无法立即联系到李昊石和笑果置评。
"On Chinese social media, reactions to the fine varied, with some commenters saying that it was too severe. One widely shared comment pointed out that a company that had provided fake P.C.R. test results was fined no more than $11,000.",在中国社交媒体上，对罚款的反应各不相同，一些评论者说罚款太重了。一条广为流传的评论指出，一家核酸造假的公司被罚款7.35万元。
But a strong chorus of support for punishing Mr. Li made it clear that his words had affronted a far broader cohort than Chinese officialdom.,但许多人对惩罚李昊石的强烈支持表明，他的言论激怒了比中国官员更广泛的群体。
"""What's worthy of our attention in this incident is that it not only angered censors but also upset a lot of patriotic people,"" Mr. Zou said. ""Cases like this fine are where the general public and state-sponsored strands of nationalism meet.""","""这起事件值得我们关注的是，它不仅激怒了审查者，也激怒了很多爱国人士，""邹胜说。""像这样的罚款案件是普通公众和国家支持的民族主义势力汇合的地方。"""
It is one of the defining competitions of our age: The countries that can make batteries for electric cars will reap decades of economic and geopolitical advantages.,这是我们这个时代具决定性意义的竞争之一:能为电动汽车制造电池的国家将享有几十年的经济和地缘政治优势。
The only winner so far is China.,到目前为止，这场竞争的唯一赢家是中国。
"Despite billions in Western investment, China is so far ahead mining rare minerals, training engineers and building huge factories that the rest of the world may take decades to catch up.",尽管西方国家投了数十亿美元，但由于中国在开采稀有矿物、培训工程师，以及建设大型工厂方面遥遥领先，世界其他国家也许需要几十年的时间才能迎头赶上。
"Even by 2030, China will make more than twice as many batteries as every other country combined, according to estimates from Benchmark Minerals, a consulting group.",据咨询集团基准矿业情报公司估计，即使到2030年时，中国的电池产量也将是其他所有国家总和的两倍多。
"Here's how China controls each step of lithium-ion battery production, from getting the raw materials out of the ground to making the cars, and why these advantages are likely to last.",以下是中国如何控制锂离子电池生产的每个步骤，从开采原材料到制造电动汽车，以及为什么这些优势很可能将持续一段时间的原因。
"Electric cars use about six times more rare minerals than conventional cars because of the battery, and China gets to decide who gets the minerals first and at what price.",因为需要电池，电动汽车使用的稀有矿物大约是传统汽车的六倍，中国目前决定着谁先获得这些矿物，以及获取的价格。
"Although China has few underground deposits of the essential ingredients, it has pursued a long-term strategy to buy its way into a cheap and steady supply. Chinese companies, relying on state assistance, acquired stakes in mining companies on five continents.",尽管中国几乎没有电池所需成分的地下矿藏，但一直在追求一项长期战略，通过购买的方式获得廉价且稳定的供应。中国企业在国家的帮助下在五大洲收购矿业公司的股份。
"China owns most of the cobalt mines in Congo, which has the majority of the world's supply of this scarce material needed for the most common type of battery. American companies failed to keep up and even sold mines to their Chinese counterparts.",中国拥有刚果的大部分钴矿，钴是最常见的电池类型所需的稀缺材料，其全球供应的大部分来自刚果。美国公司未能跟上，甚至将矿山卖给了它们的中国同行。
"As a result, China controls 41 percent of the world's cobalt mining, and the most mining for lithium, which carries a battery's electric charge.",结果是，中国控制着全球41%的钴矿开采和半数以上的锂矿开采，锂离子是电池中的电荷携带者。
"Global supplies of nickel, manganese and graphite are much larger and batteries use only a fraction. But China's steady supply of these minerals still gives it an advantage. China's investments in Indonesia will help it become the largest controller of nickel by 2027, according to forecasts by CRU Group, a consulting firm.",虽然镍、锰和石墨的全球供应量要大得多，而且电池只使用其中的一小部分，但中国稳定供应这些矿物的能力仍为其带来优势。据咨询公司CRU集团的预测，中国对印尼的投资将有助于它到2027年时成为镍的最大控制国。
Graphite is mostly mined in China. U.S. producers synthesize graphite at much greater cost.,石墨主要是在中国开采。美国生产商合成石墨，但成本更高。
"Western countries also own mines abroad, and are trying to catch up with China. But they have been more reluctant to put money into countries with unstable governments or poor labor practices. And they have been slow to ramp up their own production.",西方国家也在国外拥有矿产，并正在努力追赶中国。但西方国家不太愿意在政府不稳定或缺乏劳工保护的国家投资，而且在提高本国产量上进展缓慢。
"A new mine can take more than 20 years to reach full production. Although the United States is investing to tap its significant lithium reserves, the effort has run into a host of local and environmental concerns.",一座新矿需要20多年才能实现全部产能。尽管美国正在投资开发国内丰富的锂储量，但这一努力已遇到许多地方层面和环境方面的担忧。
"Regardless of who mines the minerals, nearly everything is shipped to China to be refined into battery-grade materials.",不管这些矿物在哪里开采，它们几乎全部运往中国，在那里提炼成电池级材料。
"Once ore is taken from the ground, it is usually pulverized and then treated with heat and chemicals to isolate the mineral compounds. The process is wasteful: Cobalt generates about 860 pounds of waste rock for each pound of refined cobalt powder.",矿石从地下开采出来后通常需要粉碎，然后进行热处理和化学处理，以分离出化合物。这个过程产生很多废料:提炼每公斤钴粉会产生大约860公斤的废渣。
"Refining needs huge amounts of energy. Battery minerals require three to four times as much energy to make as steel or copper. The preferred form of lithium, for example, needs to be heated, steamed and dried. Supported by the government with cheap land and energy, Chinese companies have been able to refine minerals at larger volume and lower cost than everyone else. This has caused refineries elsewhere to close.",提炼需要大量能源。提炼电池矿物所需的能量是炼钢或炼铜的三到四倍。例如，获得人们喜欢用的锂形态需要进行加热、蒸发浓缩和干燥处理。由于政府提供廉价土地和能源支持，中国公司可用比其他任何地方都低的成本提炼更多的矿物。这已导致其他地方的提炼厂关门。
"Refining also often causes pollution, and Chinese refineries benefit from less stringent environmental regulations. Grinding graphite causes air pollution. Processing nickel generates toxic waste, which must be disposed of in special structures in the ocean or underground. Experts say that using more sustainable methods to process battery minerals drives up costs.",提炼也往往造成污染，中国的提炼厂受益于不那么严格的环境保护法规。研磨石墨产生空气污染。加工镍产生的有毒废料需要在海洋或地下的特殊结构中进行处理。专家表示，使用更可持续的方法来处理制造电池所需的矿物将导致电池成本上升。
"Today the United States has little processing capability. A refinery typically takes two to five years to build. Training workers and adjusting equipment can take additional time. Australia's first lithium refinery, which has some Chinese ownership, was approved in 2016 but failed to produce battery-grade lithium until last year.",美国如今几乎没有处理能力。提炼厂通常需要两到五年的时间才能建成。培训工人和调试设备会需要更长时间。澳大利亚的第一家锂提炼厂(中国拥有部分股份)是2016年获得批准的，但直到去年才生产出电池级的锂。
China became the largest battery producer partly by figuring out how to make battery components efficiently and at lower cost.,中国成为世界最大的电池生产国，部分原因是中国搞清楚了如何高效、低成本地生产电池的组成部分。
"The most important component is the cathode, which is the battery's positive terminal. Of all battery materials, cathodes are the most difficult and energy intensive to make. Until the last several months, the most common cathode used a combination of nickel, cobalt and manganese, also known as NMC cathodes. This formula allows a battery to store a lot of electricity in a small space, providing an electric car with longer range.",最重要的组成部分是阴极，也就是电池的正端。在所有的电池材料中，阴极的制造最难、也最耗能。直到最近几个月，最常见的阴极使用的是镍钴锰酸锂(又名NMC阴极)。该材料组合让电池在更小的空间里储存大量电能，从而为电动汽车提供更长的续航里程。
"China has invested in a cheaper alternative that has now taken half the cathode market. Known as LFP, for lithium iron phosphate, these cathodes use widely available iron and phosphate instead of nickel, manganese and cobalt.",中国投资了一种更廉价的替代品，现在已占阴极市场的一半。这种名为磷酸铁锂的阴极用更容易获得的磷酸铁盐取代了镍锰钴酸盐。
"For western countries, LFP is an opportunity to bypass bottlenecks in the mineral supply. But China produces almost all the world's LFP.",对西方国家来说，磷酸铁锂是一个绕过稀有矿产供应瓶颈的机会。但中国目前生产世界上几乎所有的磷酸铁锂。
"Today the United States makes only about 1 percent of the world's cathodes, all of which are NMC. American companies are interested in LFP, but they must team up with Chinese companies that have the experience producing it.",美国如今只生产世界上大约1%的阴极，而且都是镍钴锰酸锂。虽然美国公司对磷酸铁锂感兴趣，但它们需要与有生产经验的中国企业合作。
"Chinese companies make most of the battery's other components. They dominate the production of anodes, the negative end of a battery. China also sells the most separators, a layer that goes between the cathode and anode to prevent short-circuiting. Electrolytes, made of mostly lithium salts and solvent, are needed for conductivity, and the top four electrolyte producers in the world are Chinese.",电池的大部分其他组件也都由中国公司生产，他们还主导着阳极的生产，也就是电池的负端。中国也销售世界上最多的隔膜，隔膜是位于阴极和阳极之间防止短路的部件。导电所需的电解液主要由锂盐和溶剂制成，世界前四大电解液生产商都在中国。
"China has the most electric cars on the road and nearly all of them use Chinese-made batteries. In 2015, Beijing enacted policies to block foreign rivals and raise consumer demand. Chinese battery manufacturers like CATL and BYD grew at the expense of their Japanese and South Korean competitors and became the largest in the world.",中国拥有最多的电动汽车，它们几乎全都使用中国制造的电池。中国政府曾在2015年出台了一项阻止外国竞争对手、提高本国消费需求的政策。宁德时代和比亚迪等中国电池制造商得以成长起来，击败了日本和韩国的竞争对手，成为世界上最大的电池制造厂家。
"Eight years later, the Biden administration is now pursuing a similar strategy to foster battery development in the United States.",八年后的今天，拜登政府正在推出类似的战略，以促进美国的电池发展。
"But in a business with huge capital costs and thin profit margins, Chinese companies have a big head start after years of state funding and experience.",但在这个资本成本巨大、利润率微薄的行业，中国企业有先起步的优势，以及多年来在国家资金支持下获得的经验。
"Battery assembly is complex and technical. To make one, cathode and anode materials are attached to thin metal sheets each about one-fifth the thickness of a human hair. These are then stacked with separators, moistened with electrolytes, and rolled up. The entire process needs to take place in rooms that minimize air particles and moisture.",电池的组装很复杂且技术性强。组装一个电池需要将阴极和阳极材料贴附在厚度约为人头发五分之一的薄金属板上。然后用隔膜将阴极板和阳极板隔开后叠在一起，用电解液浸泡，再卷起来。整个过程需要在净化车间里进行，以尽量减少空气中的颗粒物和水分。
"China can build battery factories at nearly half the cost of countries in North America or Europe, according to Heiner Heimes, a professor at RWTH Aachen University in Germany. The main reasons: Labor costs are lower, and there are more equipment manufacturers in China.",中国能以比北美或欧洲国家低一半的成本建造电池厂，德国亚琛工业大学教授海纳·海默斯说。主要原因是:中国的劳动力成本更低，而且有更多的设备制造商。
"American investors remain wary about putting money into electric vehicles. Traditional cars are still very profitable, American workers need to be trained in new skills, and U.S. government incentives to help the E.V. industry could disappear with the next presidential election cycle.",美国投资者对投资电动汽车行业仍持谨慎态度。传统汽车行业仍有很高的利润，美国工人需要接受新技能的培训，而且，美国政府为帮助电动汽车行业提供的激励措施可能会随着下一个总统大选周期的到来而消失。
"China has spent more than $130 billion on research incentives, government contracts and consumer subsidies, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Electric car buyers in China get tax rebates, cheaper vehicle registration, preferential parking and access to an extensive charging network. China's investments have allowed the country to lead the world in production, equipment and product design.",据战略与国际研究中心的数据，中国已把逾1300亿美元的钱花在鼓励研究、政府合同和消费者补贴上。中国的电动汽车购买者享有退税、更便宜的车辆登记、优先停车位等福利，以及覆盖范围广的充电网络。中国的投资已使国内厂家在生产、设备，以及产品设计方面处于世界领先地位。
"Experts say it is next to impossible for any other country to become self-reliant in the battery supply chain, no matter if it has cheaper labor or finds other global partners. Companies anywhere in the world will look to form partnerships with Chinese manufacturers to enter or expand in the industry.",专家们表示，任何其他国家在电池供应链中实现独立自主已几乎不可能，无论是否有更便宜的劳动力、是否能在全球找到其他合作伙伴。世界各地的公司为进入该行业或扩大已有能力都将寻求与中国制造商建立合作伙伴关系。
"""There is no way anybody is going to become successful in electric vehicles without having some type of cooperation with China, either directly or indirectly,"" said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at C.S.I.S.","""如果不与中国进行某种形式的合作，无论是直接的还是间接的，任何人都不可能在电动汽车领域取得成功，""战略与国际研究中心的高级顾问斯科特·肯尼迪说。"
"A Chinese court said it sentenced a 78-year-old American citizen to life in prison on Monday on unspecified charges of spying, the latest in a wave of espionage cases the authorities have pursued amid growing wariness of foreign influence in the country.",周一，中国一家法院表示以间谍罪判处一名78岁的美国公民无期徒刑，具体指控未予说明。这是在日益警惕外国势力的背景下，中国有关当局追查的一系列间谍案中的最新一起。
"The Intermediate People's Court in the southeastern city of Suzhou said in a short statement that it pronounced John Shing-Wan Leung guilty of espionage and sentenced him. It said that Mr. Leung was arrested in April 2021 by state security officials, but provided no details about the charges or the circumstances of his detention or trial. The court also ordered about $70,000 worth of his personal property to be seized.",苏州中级人民法院在一份简短的声明中宣布梁成运犯有间谍罪并已宣判。声明说，梁成运于2021年4月1被国家安全官员采取强制措施，但没有说明具体指控，也没有提供拘留或审判情况的细节。法院还下令没收其个人财产人民币50万元。
"Mr. Leung holds a United States passport and is a permanent resident of Hong Kong, according to the statement posted on the court's social media account.",根据法院社交媒体帐户上发布的声明，梁成运持有美国护照，是香港的永久居民。
The court in Suzhou did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesman for the United States Embassy in Beijing said the embassy was aware of the reports about the case but declined to comment because of privacy concerns. American citizens arrested in China must sign a privacy waiver to allow embassies and consulates to release information about their cases to the public.,该法院没有回应多次置评请求。美国驻华使馆的一位发言人说，大使馆知道有关此案的报道，但出于隐私考虑拒绝置评。在中国被捕的美国公民必须签署一份隐私豁免书，大使馆和领事馆才可向公众发布有关他们案件的信息。
"Trials in China on charges of espionage or other sensitive political issues are often shrouded in secrecy, with proceedings closed to the public and the news media. Courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.",在中国，被指控为间谍或存在其他敏感政治问题的审判往往是秘密进行的，诉讼程序不对公众和新闻媒体公开。法院由执政的共产党控制。
"China has recently stepped up actions against what it sees as a growing threat of spies through a wave of raids, inspections and arrests targeting businesses with foreign ties as well as individuals.",中国最近加大了行动力度，通过一系列针对与外国有联系的企业和个人的突击搜查、检查和逮捕，来打击它所认为的日益增长的间谍威胁。
"In March, Beijing detained a Japanese business executive from a pharmaceutical company for espionage. Last year, the authorities arrested a high-ranking editor of a Chinese Communist Party newspaper while he was having lunch with a Japanese diplomat, accusing the editor of acting as an agent for Japan or the United States, his family says.",3月，中国政府以间谍罪拘留了一名日本药企高管。去年，当局逮捕了一名中国共产党报纸的高级编辑，当时他正在与一名日本外交官共进午餐，这名编辑的家人说，他被指控为日本或美国充当间谍。
"Chinese officials have raided the offices or interrogated the staff of American consulting firms such as the Mintz Group and Bain & Company. Most recently, state media announced a crackdown on the consulting industry in the name of national security, singling out Capvision Partners, a consulting firm with offices in New York and Shanghai. In describing the crackdown, China's state broadcaster CCTV accused Western countries of stealing intelligence in key industries, including defense, finance, energy and health, as part of a ""strategy of containment and suppression against China.""","中国官员还突击搜查了美国咨询公司的办公室或审问其工作人员，如美思明智集团和贝恩咨询公司。最近，国家媒体通报了一场以国家安全为名的对咨询行业的打击行动，并特别提到了在纽约和上海设有办事处的咨询公司凯盛融英。中国国家广播公司中央电视台在描述这次打击行动时，指责西方国家窃取关键行业的情报，包括国防、金融、能源和卫生，作为""对华遏制打压战略""的一部分。"
"Last month, China approved revisions to a counterespionage law that expanded the kinds of activities that could land foreigners behind bars. Experts say that the amendments, which go into effect in July, could criminalize a range of mundane tasks related to information gathering such as the work of journalists and due diligence research on companies. Foreign businesses have already begun to reassess their operations in China and increase protections for employees.",上个月，中国批准了反间谍法修订案，扩大了可能使外国人陷入囹圄的活动种类。专家说，7月生效的修正案可能将一系列与信息收集有关的平常工作定为犯罪，例如记者的工作和对各种公司进行的尽职调查。外国企业已经开始重新评估他们在华业务，并加强对雇员的保护。
"The case of Mr. Leung was unusually severe given his age, a factor that Chinese courts tend to consider when handing down punishments, said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.",新加坡国立大学李光耀公共政策学院副教授吴木銮表示，鉴于其年事已高，梁成运受到重判非同寻常。年龄往往是中国法院判决时的一个考量因素。
"""Very few people get life sentences in my memory, so there must be something quite severe about his case,"" he said, noting that 10 years was a more typical term for espionage.","""在我的印象里，被判无期的是极少数，所以他的案子肯定有相当严重的情节，""他说，并指出间谍罪名的更常见刑期为10年。"
"Professor Wu also said that the lack of information in the court's statement suggested a high level of sensitivity around the case. The authorities generally tend to provide more details about criminal cases to deter would-be offenders, he said.",吴木銮还表示，法院的宣判公告语焉不详表明此案高度敏感。他表示，当局对刑事案件往往会披露更多细节，以震慑想要犯法的人。
Little public information was available about Mr. Leung that could immediately be verified. Some news reports in Hong Kong speculated that he held positions in associations that promoted ties between China and the United States.,关于梁成运，能够立即核实清楚的公开信息少之又少。香港一些新闻报道推测，他曾在一些促进中美关系的协会中担任职务。
"In 2004, People's Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, featured someone with the same date of birth as Mr. Leung and the same Chinese name Liang Chengyun inan articleabout the pride of the Chinese diaspora around the world in seeing China's growing strength.",2004年，中共党报《人民日报》的一篇文章中出现了与梁成运同名且同日出生的人物，该文章讲述了世界各地华人看到中国日益强大的自豪感。
"In the article, People's Daily said that man had been born in Hong Kong and moved to the United States for school when he was 16. It said he had worked at the United Nations headquarters in New York, and later at a number of institutions that helped to foster cultural exchanges, including between American businesses and Chinese officials. The paper said the man loved China and wanted the country to be unified with Taiwan.",《人民日报》在文章中写道，该男子出生于香港，16岁赴英国接受教育。文章里还说他曾在纽约联合国总部工作，随后又在多家机构任职，帮助促进文化交流，包括美国企业与中国官员之间的沟通。该报表示，此人热爱中国，拥护中国统一。
Several China-related associations based in the United States that promote cultural exchanges did not immediately respond to requests for comment.,多家总部设于美国、旨在推动文化交流的涉华协会没有立即回应置评请求。
"To revive its sluggish economy, China set out this year to woo foreign investors and stabilize its ties with the West. But these goals are colliding with what China's leader, Xi Jinping, considers the paramount priority: bolstering national security in a world he sees as full of threats.",为了让死气沉沉的经济再现生机，中国今年致力于吸引外国投资者，稳定与西方的关系。但是这些目标与领导人习近平心目中的头等大事却是相悖的，那就是在一个他认为危机四伏的世界里巩固国家安全。
"Mr. Xi has warned that China must fight back against a campaign by the United States to contain and suppress the country's rise. In this worldview, foreign rivals are using spies to weaken China's economy; Russia is not treated as a pariah but a vital partner in blunting the NATO menace; and the diplomatic stage is a place to assert China's influence and reshape the global order in its favor.",习近平称美国在试图约束和压制中国的崛起，对此中国必须做出反抗。在这个世界观里，外国敌对势力在利用间谍削弱中国经济;俄罗斯不是个被排斥的国家，而是应对北约威胁的重要伙伴;外交舞台应该用来明确中国的影响力，从自身利益出发重塑国际秩序。
"At home, the authorities have sent a chill across foreign businesses by launching a nationwide crackdown on consulting firms with international ties. China's state broadcaster accused Western countries of trying to steal sensitive information in key industries with the help of consulting firms that help investors navigate the murky Chinese economy.",在国内，当局对有国际关系的咨询公司发起全国范围的打击行动，让外国商企感到阵阵寒意。这些咨询公司的用途是帮助投资者理解难以捉摸的中国经济，而中国的国家广播机构指责西方国家在它们的协助下试图窃取关键产业的敏感信息。
"Abroad, China's efforts to improve ties with Europe to drive a wedge between the United States and some of its most important allies have been complicated by Beijing's closeness to Moscow. On a visit to Germany this week, China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, dismissed criticism that Beijing wasn't doing enough to end Russia's war in Ukraine. He also warned that China would retaliate if the European Union decided to impose sanctions on Chinese companies accused of supplying Russia with technology for its military.",在国外，中国试图改善与欧洲的关系——从而在美国及其最重要的几个盟友之间制造罅隙，然而北京与莫斯科的紧密联系给这方面的行动制造了困难。在本周访问德国时，中国外交部长秦刚对北京在终止俄乌战争方面缺乏作为的说法做出了驳斥。他还警告，如果欧盟对被指向俄罗斯军方提供技术支持的中国公司施加制裁，中方会做出反制。
"China's increasingly muscular approach has also raised concerns in Canada. That government accused a Chinese diplomat of intimidating and gathering family information on a Canadian lawmaker who was an ardent critic of Beijing's treatment of Uyghur Muslims. After Ottawa ordered the Chinese official to leave, Beijing expelled a Canadian diplomat in Shanghai in a tit-for-tat move.",中国日渐强硬的做法在加拿大也引起了担忧。该国政府指控一名中国外交官威胁一名加拿大议员，并收集有关其家人的信息，该议员此前对北京对待维吾尔穆斯林的方式发起了严厉的批评。在渥太华下令要求该中国官员离境后，北京做出了对等回应，驱逐了一名加拿大驻上海外交官。
"""China's ability to manage multiple and competing interests, domestic and global, is rapidly becoming a defining challenge for Xi,"" said Evan S. Medeiros, a professor of Asian studies at Georgetown University who served as an adviser to President Barack Obama.","""中国要同时面对国内和国际上的多种相冲突的利益，这方面的能力正迅速成为习的主要挑战，""乔治城大学国际政治学教授、曾任贝拉克·奥巴马总统顾问的麦艾文(Evan S. Medeiros)说。"
"While that is not new, Mr. Medeiros said, it has become much harder as China's economic recovery has grown more fraught with export growth slowing and unemployment rates soaring. ""Xi seems to think he can both assert themselves and attract other countries, relying on the gravitational force of their economy and global frustration with U.S. power. These are big gambles.""","这种挑战从来都有，但麦艾文说，随着中国经济的复苏越来越受到出口增长放缓和失业率飙升的困扰，这一点的影响在大大增加。""习似乎认为，凭借中国经济的吸引力，以及各国对美国势力的不满，他可以在坚持自己的立场的同时吸引其它国家。这是很大的冒险。"""
"The campaign against consulting firms has puzzled observers given China's recent assurances that it was open for business again after three years of strict Covid measures. But the firms' access to data about Chinese industries, including defense, finance and science, appeared to have triggered alarms in the country's security apparatus, which now takes precedence over economic decision making.",针对咨询公司的行动令观察人士感到困惑，毕竟中国近日承诺在经过三年严格新冠防疫措施后将重新打开门做生意。但是这些公司可以获取有关中国产业的数据，包括国防、金融和科学领域，这似乎引起了中国安全部门的警觉，而安全现在是高于经济决策的优先事项。
"The party has long wrestled with the tension between its distrust of the outside world and the need to maintain global links to power its growth. Mr. Xi, however, underscored at the annual legislative session in March that he prioritized security, calling it the ""foundation of development.""","长久以来，中共都在对外部世界的不信任和必须维系全球联络以推动增长的矛盾中左右为难。不过，习近平在今年3月的两会上强调要将安全放在首位，称之为""发展的基础""。"
"""President Xi has made it pretty clear that security trumps development,"" said Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was director for China at the National Security Council under President Obama.","""习主席已经明示，安全高于发展，""布鲁金斯学会高级研究员、曾任奥巴马政府国家安全委员会中国事务主任的何瑞恩(Ryan Hass)表示。"
"""If that requires cracking some skulls at the consulting firms and scaring off foreign capital in the process, then that's a price that he appears willing to pay,"" Mr. Hass added.","""哪怕这意味着铁拳制裁咨询公司，并导致外国资本退避三舍，似乎也是他愿意付出的代价，""何瑞恩补充道。"
"Ultimately, Beijing is betting that access to China's expansive market is simply too enticing for foreign companies and governments to give up.",归根结底，中国是在赌外国企业和政府根本舍不得放弃其广阔市场。
"Mr. Qin concluded his four-day trip to Europe on Friday, after making additional stops in France and Norway, the competing interests looming throughout.",在法国和挪威进行额外停留后，秦刚于上周五结束了四天的欧洲之行，相互冲突的各方利益笼罩着此行的始终。
"In France, Mr. Qin sought to build on the friendly talks last month between Mr. Xi and President Emmanuel Macron, who had traveled to China with a bevy of French business leaders. Mr. Qin met on Wednesday with France's foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, and told her that ""China stands ready to work with France and other countries to make a bigger pie for cooperation and development opportunities.""","在法国，秦刚试图在上个月习近平与马克龙总统友好洽谈的基础上更进一步，当时马克龙率一批法国商业领袖访问了中国。周三，秦刚会见了法国外长凯瑟琳·科隆纳，并告诉她，""中国愿与法国等世界各国一道做大合作蛋糕，共享发展机遇。"""
"Mr. Macron had advocated for European ""strategic autonomy"" from Washington, particularly in regard to contentious issues like Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by Beijing. Beijing wants more countries in Europe to follow Mr. Macron's lead. But the continent remains deeply divided over China, particularly as Beijing continues to provide economic and diplomatic support to Russia as it wages a war on Western Europe's doorstep.","马克龙曾主张欧洲""战略独立""于美国，尤其是在争议问题上，比如中国宣称拥有主权的自治岛屿台湾。中国希望更多欧洲国家能效仿马克龙的立场。但欧洲大陆在中国问题上仍存在严重分歧，特别是因为俄罗斯在西欧家门口发动战争之时，中国仍继续向其提供经济和外交支持。"
"The acerbic tone of Chinese diplomats has also done China no favors. Last month, its ambassador to France, Lu Shaye, set off a diplomatic firestorm after he questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet states like Ukraine. The remark, which was walked back by the foreign ministry, may have reflected an outsize level of confidence within the Chinese leadership about China's lure.",中国外交官的尖酸言辞更是雪上加霜。上个月，驻法大使卢沙野因对乌克兰等前苏联国家的主权提出质疑而引发了一场外交风暴。这番已被外交部否认的发言可能反映了中国领导层对本国吸引力的过分自信。
"""China believes it has a relatively high degree of flexibility to use aggressive tactics to protect its interests because the Europeans cannot afford to allow for ruptures,"" Mr. Hass said. ""We'll get to see that theory put to the test going forward.""","""中国相信它可以相对十分灵活地利用攻击策略来保护自身利益，因为欧洲人承受不起关系破裂的后果，""何瑞恩说。""这一假设将在未来受到考验。"""
"Unease about Beijing's assertiveness has pushed more countries deeper into the arms of the United States, including long-established allies like Japan, South Korea and Australia, as well as fence straddlers like the Philippines. It has also brought India closer to Washington than ever, something that once seemed unthinkable in U.S. foreign policy circles given Delhi's history of nonalignment.",对中国独断作风的不安促使更多国家愈发紧靠美国，这其中既有日本、韩国和澳大利亚这样的长期盟友，也有菲律宾这样的骑墙派。印度也前所未有地靠近了美国，由于该国的不结盟传统，这在以往是美国外交政策界不可想象的。
"Analysts say those sorts of self-inflicted wounds are unavoidable under Mr. Xi's leadership. The more Mr. Xi feels insecure and threatened, the more his nationalistic tendencies compel him to push back, regardless of the costs.",分析人士称，在习近平的领导下，中国这种自我伤害是不可避免的。习近平越是感到不安全和受威胁，民族主义倾向就越会迫使他不惜一切代价进行反击。
"""The regime has been in a defensive position after the failure of the 'zero Covid' policy and the economic slowdown, so Xi has to show a strong face,"" said Suisheng Zhao, a U.S.-China expert at the University of Denver. ""As long as he feels vulnerable, he will try to project to the world that he's powerful, stands firm and will defend all of China's so-called vital interests.""","""在'新冠清零'政策失败和经济放缓之后，中共政权一直处于防御状态，因此习近平必须拿出强势姿态，""丹佛大学美中问题专家赵穗生表示。""只要还感到脆弱，他对外就会努力展示强势和坚定，将会捍卫中国一切所谓的重大利益。"""
"Even so, talks this week between China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, and Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, hinted at a possible thaw in relations between Beijing and Washington.",即便如此，中国最高外交官王毅本周与美国国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文的会谈仍暗示了中美关系解冻的可能。
"As relations with the West teeter, China has intensified its courtship of the global south, holding recent meetings with the foreign ministers of Pakistan and Afghanistan, while Mr. Xi is set to chair the first China-Central Asia Summit on May 18.","随着与西方关系的动荡，中国加速拉拢""全球南方""，近来与巴基斯坦和阿富汗外长都举行了会晤，而习近平也将于5月18日主持首届中国—中亚峰会。"
"""From China's perspective, considering its deteriorating relations with advanced, democratic countries of the global north, this makes sense,"" said Bates Gill, executive director of the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis.","""考虑到与'全球北方'发达民主国家日益恶化的关系，这对中国而言是合理之举，""亚洲协会中国分析中心执行主任季北慈(Bates Gill)表示。"
"China's intention is to be ""a much bigger player in the global south,"" Mr. Gill added, so that it can ""leverage that influence within the larger geopolitical rivalry with the United States.""","季北慈补充说，中国的意图是""在'全球南方'发挥远大于目前的影响力""，这样就可以""在与美国更大的地缘政治斗争中利用这一优势""。"
"A court in southern China has sentenced one of the country's most unyielding human rights activists to eight years in prison for essays he wrote and a website he created, in the ruling Communist Party's latest warning blow against political dissent.",因撰写的文章及创建的网站，中国一位最不屈不挠的人权活动人士被南方一家法院判处八年有期徒刑，这是执政共产党对政治异见人士发出的最新警告。
"The activist, Yang Maodong, was detained in 2021 when he tried to catch a flight to the United States to be with his wife, who was gravely ill. Mr. Yang who is better known by his pen name, Guo Feixiong was sentenced at the end of a one-day trial on Thursday in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province. He was accused of ""inciting subversion of state power.""","活动人士杨茂东于2021年搭乘飞往美国的航班时被拘留，他当时试图赴美陪伴身患重病的妻子。杨茂东(以笔名郭飞雄为人所熟知)于周四在广州经过一天的审判后获刑。他被指控""煽动颠覆国家政权""。"
"A guilty judgment from the Communist Party-controlled court seemed assured, but the swiftness of Mr. Yang's conviction and sentencing took his supporters by surprise. Chinese courts often wait a week or longer after a trial before announcing a decision. Mr. Yang was sentenced after a morning hearing that lasted around two hours.",共产党控制的法院对他做出有罪判决似乎是肯定的事情，但定罪和判刑的速度之快让他的支持者感到意外。中国法院通常在庭审后等待一周或更长时间才宣布判决。持续两小时的听证会在上午进行，听证会结束后，杨茂东被判刑。
"China's leader, Xi Jinping, over the past decade in power, has strengthened and emboldened the security apparatus to remove any perceived threats to the party's rule. The police swiftly extinguished a flare-up of protests against harsh ""zero Covid"" restrictions in late October last year, when some demonstrators denounced Mr. Xi and the party.","在过去十年，为了消除被视为对党的统治所构成的任何潜在威胁，安全机构在中国领导人习近平执政期间得到了强化了，变得更加肆无忌惮。去年10月下旬，一些示威者在抗议严厉的""新冠清零""限制措施时谴责习近平和共产党，警方迅速将抗议活动扑灭。"
"But Mr. Xi and other leaders appear determined to make sure that no lingering sparks of opposition have a chance to ignite broader opposition. Mr. Yang's sentencing came one month after another Chinese court sentenced two prominent human rights lawyers, Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi, to 14 years and 12 years in prison.",但习近平和其他领导人似乎下定决心坚决扑灭反对情绪的余烬，使其无法引燃更为广泛的爆发。在杨茂东被判刑一个月前，另一家中国法院分别判处两位知名人权律师许志永和丁家喜14年和12年徒刑。
"In accusing Mr. Yang of inciting subversion a vague charge that amounts to denouncing the Communist Party prosecutors cited essays that Mr. Yang had written over many years, as well as a pro-democracy website he helped set up, and an interview he gave, Mr. Yang's brother, Yang Maoquan, said in a statement that was posted online.",杨茂东的弟弟杨茂全在网上的一份声明中说，检察官因杨茂东多年来撰写的文章、帮助建立的一个支持民主的网站以及他接受的一个采访，指控他煽动颠覆国家政权。这是一个模糊的指控，相当于指控其谴责共产党。
"According to the brother's account of the proceedings, the prosecutors said that Mr. Yang's statements amounted to a ""long-term assault on and vilification of China's political system, inciting others to subvert state power."" Yang Maoquan's account was confirmed by Mr. Yang's sister, Yang Maoping, who was not at the trial but spoke to people who were. Mr. Yang's lawyer, Zhang Lei, declined to comment.","根据其弟对诉讼过程的描述，检察官表示，杨茂东的言论构成""对中国政治制度的长期攻击和诋毁，煽动他人颠覆国家政权""。杨茂全的说法得到了杨茂东的姐姐杨茂平的证实，她没有出席庭审，但与在场的人进行了交谈。杨茂东的律师张磊拒绝置评。"
"""He didn't subvert anyone,"" Ms. Yang, the sister, said in a telephone interview on Friday. ""Who has the strength to subvert a country as big as this? Is it unacceptable just to speak out a few words?""","""他没有颠覆到任何人，""姐姐杨茂平周五接受电话采访时说。""这么大的国家，谁都有能力去颠覆的?连说几句话是不行了吗?"""
"Still, Mr. Yang, 56, seemed unbowed, even as he faced his third prison stint. He started reading a long statement that he had prepared for the trial that defended his activism and ideals, but a judge ordered him to stop after a few minutes. The statement was published by Yibao, an overseas Chinese website, and corroborated by Mr. Yang's sister.",尽管如此，56岁的杨茂东似乎并不屈服，哪怕面临第三次入狱。他开始念一份为审判准备的长篇声明，为他的激进主义和理想辩护，但几分钟后就被法官叫停。声明由海外的中文网站《议报》发表，内容得到杨茂东姐姐的证实。
"Since he first joined protests in the 1980s, Mr. Yang said in his statement, ""my political credo and ideals have never changed: for China to fully realize authentic freedom, democracy, human rights and rule of law. This is the original, foundational and ultimate intention of all my social, intellectual and academic activities.""","杨茂东在声明中说，自从他在1980年代第一次参加抗议活动以来，""我的政治主张和政治理想从来没有改变过:在中国彻底实现真正的自由民主人权法治。这是我的一切社会思想学术活动和政治活动原始的、根本的、终极的行为意图。"""
"Mr. Yang has been one of China's most persistent opponents of authoritarian rule. He became widely known in activist circles in 2005, when he helped organize villagers in southern China to protest land seizures that they said were corrupt and unfair.",杨茂东一直是中国最坚定的威权统治反对者之一。2005年，他帮助组织中国南方的村民抗议他们认为腐败和不公平的征地行为，在活动人士圈子中声名鹊起。
"He was sentenced to prison in 2007 on charges of illegal business activities related to publishing (Mr. Yang also wrote science-fiction novels.). After his release, he resumed his political activities, and in 2013 he joined protests at the Southern Weekend newspaper in Guangzhou, where journalists had denounced tightening censorship under Mr. Xi.",2007年，他因与出版有关的非法商业活动被判入狱(杨茂东还写过科幻小说)。获释后，他继续参与政治维权，并于2013年在广州参加了《南方周末》的抗议活动，该报记者谴责了习近平领导下收紧审查制度。
"Mr. Yang was sentenced to six years in prison in 2015 on charges of disturbing public order and ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"" for his role in the newspaper protest and for supporting a campaign for China to ratify an international rights covenant.","2015年，杨茂东因在该报抗议活动中的作用以及支持呼吁中国批准国际人权公约的运动被判扰乱公共秩序和""寻衅滋事""罪，获刑六年。"
"He was detained again in January 2021 when he sought to fly to the United States, where his wife, Zhang Qing, was in the late stages of cancer. She and their two children had settled there in 2009.",2021年1月，他试图赴美时被再次拘留，当时他身患晚期癌症的妻子张青在美国。她和他们的两个孩子于2009年在那里定居。
"""He just wanted to visit his sick wife, fearing that maybe he would never see her again in this life,"" said Zan Aizong, a friend of Mr. Yang's in eastern China who recalled meeting him in late 2021 and discussing his plans to reach the United States. ""I guessed that he wouldn't be allowed to leave, but he was very confident that he would get to see her, because this was plain humanitarianism.""","""他就想看他生病的妻子，担心或许他这一辈子再也见不着面，""杨茂东在中国东部的朋友昝爱宗说，他回忆起2021年底与他见面并讨论他的赴美计划。""我想他是去不了的，但他还是很有自信认为他能去见，因为(这)简直是人道主义。"""
"Mr. Yang went to Shanghai, hoping to take a flight to San Francisco. But airport officers told him that, as a ""national security risk,"" he could not board the plane, Mr. Yang said at the time. He has been held ever since. His wife died almost a year after Mr. Yang's attempted flight.","杨茂东去了上海，希望乘机抵达旧金山。但是，杨茂东当时说，机场工作人员告诉他，作为""国家安全风险""，他不能登机。从那以后他就一直遭到关押。自杨茂东试图乘机未果近一年后，妻子去世了。"
"Even in detention, Mr. Yang has defied the authorities, appearing emaciated from frequent hunger strikes, said his sister, Ms. Yang. She said she worried about whether he could endure years of detention before his possible release. Even after his formal release from prison, he is likely to come under oppressive informal confinement, like many other dissidents.",他的姐姐杨茂平说，即使在拘留期间，杨茂东也一直不惧当局，因经常绝食而憔悴不堪。她说自己担心他在出狱前能否挺过数年的牢狱。即使在他正式出狱后，他也可能像许多其他持不同政见者一样受到压迫性的非正式监禁。
"""I'm really, really worried,"" Ms. Yang said.","""我是非常担忧，非常担忧，""杨茂平说。"
"Last October, construction plans for a hulking semiconductor factory owned by a major state-backed company in central China fell into disarray. The Biden administration had escalated the trade war over technology, severing China's access to the Western tools and skilled workers it needed to build the most advanced semiconductors.",去年10月，中国中部一家主要国有企业下属的大型半导体工厂的建设计划陷入混乱。拜登政府升级了对华技术贸易战，切断了中国获得制造最先进半导体所需的西方工具和技术人员的途径。
"Some employees with U.S. citizenship departed the company. Three U.S. equipment suppliers almost immediately halted their shipments and services, and Europe and Japan are expected to do the same soon.",一些拥有美国国籍的员工已离开公司。三家美国设备供应商几乎立即停止了发货和服务，欧洲和日本的公司预计很快也会紧随其后。
"The facility belonged to Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation, or YMTC, a memory chip company that Xi Jinping, China's president, has extolled as a flag-bearer in China's race toward self-reliance. Now, the chip maker and its peers are hurriedly overhauling supply chains and rewriting business plans.",这家工厂是被中国国家主席习近平寄予厚望的国家存储器基地项目实施主体长江存储科技有限责任公司。现在，这家芯片制造厂和其他同类工厂正在忙着改变供应链、重写商业计划。
"Nearly seven monthslater, the U.S. trade barriers have accelerated China's push for a more independent chip sector. Western technology and money have pulled out, but state funding is flooding in to cultivate homegrown alternatives to produce less advanced but still lucrative semiconductors. And China has not given up on making high-end chips: Manufacturers are attempting to work with older parts from abroad not blocked by the U.S. sanctions, as well as less advanced equipment at home.",美国提高贸易壁垒近七个月后，中国已在加速提高国内芯片行业的自主性。西方的技术和资金已经撤走，但政府正在为培育本土替代产品投入大量资金，尽管本土生产的半导体不是最先进的，但利润仍然丰厚。中国也没有放弃高端芯片的生产:制造商们正试图使用不受美国出口禁令限制的外国老部件，以及国内已有的不太先进的设备。
"The tough U.S. restrictions stemmed from alarm over what officials in Washington viewed as the threat posed by China's use of its technology companies to upgrade its military arsenal. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, recently characterized the sentiment as part of a ""new consensus"" in Washington that decades of economic integration with China was not wholly successful, adding that the new controls were ""carefully tailored"" to go after China's most cutting-edge semiconductors.","美国严格限制向中国出口半导体制造设备是出于一种担忧，华盛顿的官员们认为，中国使用民用技术企业提升本国军事能力的做法已构成威胁。美国国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文最近把这种看法描述为华盛顿""新共识""的一部分，""新共识""认为几十年来与中国的经济一体化并不完全成功，他还表示，新的控制措施是针对中国最尖端的半导体而""精心制定的""。"
"Under the October rules, American enterprises and citizens may no longer aid any Chinese companies building chip technology that meets a certain threshold of sophistication. The controls went beyond Trump administration trade curbs that went after specific companies like the Chinese telecom giant Huawei.",按照去年10月宣布的规定，美国的企业和公民不能再为任何中国公司开发复杂程度高过某个门槛的芯片技术提供帮助。新控制措施超过了特朗普政府针对个别中国企业(比如电信设备巨头华为)的贸易限制。
"During those earlier trade tensions, Beijing mobilized vast sums tocultivate homegrown alternatives to Western chip makers. But foreigncomponents were readily available and of higher quality, leaving many Chinese firms unwilling to make the switch.",在面临这些早期贸易限制后，中国政府曾为培育取代西方芯片制造商的本土公司投入大量资金。但外国零部件仍容易得到且质量更高，让许多中国公司不愿改为使用国产芯片。
"Those reservations about using materials from China appear to be easing. Chinese tech companies up and down the supply chain are assessing how to replace Western chips and related components, even those unaffected by U.S. controls. Guangzhou Automobile Group, a state-owned electric vehicle manufacturer, said in February that it aimed to eventually purchase all of its roughly 1,000 chips in its cars from Chinese providers. It currently buys 90 percent of its chips from overseas.",对使用中国本土材料的顾虑似乎正在减少。处于供应链上游和下游的中国科技企业正在评估如何将西方芯片和相关器件(甚至是那些不受美国出口管制影响的器件)替换下来的办法。国有电动汽车制造商广汽集团曾在今年2月表示，最终目标是从国内供应商那里购买生产汽车所需的约1000种芯片。广汽集团目前从海外购买其90%的芯片。
"""The goal now in China in a lot of areas is to de-Americanize supply chains,"" said Paul Triolo, the senior vice president for China at Albright Stonebridge Group, a strategy firm.","""中国很多行业目前的目标是在供应链中去美国化，""战略公司奥尔布赖特石桥集团的中国部高级副总裁保罗·特廖罗说。"
"Dozens of Chinese chip companies are finalizing plans to raise money through public offerings this year. They include China's second-largest chip manufacturer, Hua Hong Semiconductor, as well as a chip tool maker backed by Huawei.",几十家中国芯片公司正在敲定今年通过公开募股筹集资金的计划。这些公司包括中国第二大芯片制造商华虹半导体和一家得到华为支持的半导体设备制造商。
"The technology disputes between the world's two largest economies show no signs of abating. The Biden administration has drafted, but not yet released, new rules that would restrict American venture capital investments in advanced chip companies in China. Foreign investment into China's semiconductor sector this year has already tumbled to $600 million, its lowest point since 2020, according to data from PitchBook, which tracks private financing. And officials are mulling tighter controls on technologies like quantum computing or chip manufacturing equipment.",世界上两个最大经济体在技术方面的争端没有缓和的迹象。拜登政府已起草了限制美国风险投资对中国高端芯片公司投资的新规定，但尚未公布。据跟踪私人融资的PitchBook数据，外国对中国半导体行业的投资今年已跌至六亿美元，是自2020年以来最少的。美国官员正在考虑对量子计算或芯片制造设备等技术进行更严格的控制。
"U.S. restrictions have caused Beijing to activate a state fund that had been dormant because of waste and graft: The government's ""Big Fund"" injected roughly $1.9 billion into YMTC in February to bolster its response to the U.S. restrictions. The fund has also recently put money into chip equipment and material suppliers, according to state media reports.","美国的限制措施已导致中国政府重启一项国家基金，该基金曾因浪费和贪污问题停了一段时间。今年2月，政府通过所谓的""大基金二期""给长江存储注入了近129亿元的资金，以加强它对美国限制措施的应对。据官媒报道，""大基金""最近也对芯片设备和材料供应商进行了投资。"
"The new subsidies aim to remove Western components from China's supply chains. The southern city of Guangzhou has earmarked over $21 billion this year for semiconductor and other tech projects including those that attempt to replace Western chip equipment suppliers. Purchase orders for Chinese-made equipment have spiked in recent months, according to corporate reports and press statements.",这些新补贴的目的是去掉中国供应链中的西方零部件。南方城市广州今年成立了1500亿元产业资金，将重点投资半导体等重要技术行业，包括那些试图取代西方芯片制造设备供应商的项目。据公司财报和发布的消息，中国制造的设备的采购订单近几个月来已经激增。
"Mr. Xi has been outspoken about what he sees as an effort by Western countries to enforce an ""all-around containment"" of China. During an important legislative meeting in March, the Chinese president interrupted remarks by a delegate from a Chinese crane manufacturer. The exchange was widely reported by state media: ""The chips inside your cranes,are they locally sourced?"" Mr. Xi asked. Yes, the delegate said.","习近平直言不讳地谈到，他认为西方国家正在努力对中国实施""全方位遏制""。在今年3月的两会上，他打断了一名中国起重机制造商代表的发言。中国官媒广泛报道了国家主席与那名代表的对话:""你们起重机里面的芯片，是国产的吗?""习近平问。""全是国产的，""那名代表答道。"
"So far, less than 1 percent of all semiconductors in China are at the industry's top end that are subject to U.S. controls, according to estimates from Yole Group, a market research firm. The rest are less advanced, or ""mature,"" semiconductors, found in everydayconsumer electronicsand cars, and are ""the vast majority of the business,"" said Jean-Christophe Eloy, the chief executive of Yole Group. Those chips, largely untouched by the Biden administration's October controls, are now seeing a surge of investment, he added.","据市场研究公司Yole Group估计，中国到目前为止生产的所有半导体中只有不到1%是受美国限制的行业高端产品。Yole Group首席执行官让-克里斯托夫·埃洛伊说，其他的都是不太先进或""成熟""的半导体，用于日常电子消费产品和汽车，这些产品是中国半导体行业的""绝大部分业务""。这些芯片基本上不受拜登政府去年10月宣布的出口管制的影响，它们现在正在迎来投资的激增，他补充说。"
"China's two largest chip manufacturers, the state-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, and Hua Hong Semiconductor have each announced billions of dollars this year to expand production into mature chips, according to public announcements.",中国最大的两家芯片制造商是国家支持的中芯国际和华虹半导体，它们今年分别宣布了数十亿美元的投资，用于扩大成熟芯片的生产。
"Yet over the long term, China's lack of access to world-class tools needed to make chips could stymie its progress in many advanced industries like artificial intelligence and aerospace, according to Handel Jones, the chief executive of International Business Strategies, a consulting firm.",不过，咨询公司International Business Strategies的首席执行官亨德尔·琼斯称，从长远来看，中国无法获得制造高端芯片所需的世界级工具的问题可能会阻碍它在人工智能和航空航天等许多先进领域取得进步。
"Last August, YMTC had targeted a three fold increase in its share of global chip production to 13 percent by 2027, challenging chip incumbents likeU.S.-based Micron Technology,according to Yole Group's estimates. Facing troublebuilding out its second factory, the Chinese memory chip maker's production is set to decline, sliding to just 3 percent of the market in 2027.",据Yole Group估计，去年8月，长江存储曾制定了挑战美国美光科技等老牌芯片企业的目标，到2027年时，将其在全球芯片生产中的份额提高到13%，达到目前的三倍。这家中国存储芯片制造商在建设第二家工厂时遇到了困难，其产量将出现下降，到2027年时，长江存储的产品在全球市场所占份额将下滑到3%。
"International companies that had previously invested in China's semiconductor industry are diverting their investments elsewhere. Korea and Taiwan's leading chip manufacturers, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, are investing billions of dollars into new production in the United States. The Taiwanese chip-maker is applying for U.S. subsidies for its Arizona factory that force it to cap its investment intoChina for a decade.",以前曾投资中国半导体行业的国际企业正在将投资转移到其他地方。韩国的三星和台湾的高端芯片制造商台积电投资数十亿美元，正在美国建设新生产线。这家台湾芯片制造商也在为其在亚利桑那州的工厂申请美国政府的补贴，这将迫使台积电限制其未来十年在中国的投资。
"At the sametime, experts said, the weakening of foreign influence over China's chip sector is creating opportunity for domestic companies. Last month, a semiconductor equipment manufacturer went public in Shanghai. Shares of the company, Crystal Growth & Energy Equipment, have climbed 30 percent since its debut.",专家们说，与此同时，国外对中国芯片行业影响的减少正在为国内企业创造机会。上个月，半导体设备制造商南京晶升装备股份有限公司在上海上市，公司股票自上市以来已增长了30%。
"""It's because of the sanctions that there's now space in the market,"" said Xiang Ligang, a director of a Beijing-based technology consortium who has advised the Chinese government on technology issues. ""Now we have a chance to develop.""","""正是由于美国的出口管制，才有了现在的市场空间，""总部设在北京的一家技术联合体的董事项立刚说，他曾在技术问题上为中国政府提建议。""我们现在才有了发展机会。"""
"The recent burst of state cash could supercharge China's share of global production in lower-end chips. In the next decade, China could account for roughly half of the world's production capacity for a class of mature semiconductors, according to a jointly written report by Rhodium Group, a consulting firm, and Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a think tank in Berlin.",最近的国家投资激增可能会极大提高中国在全球低端芯片生产中所占份额。据咨询公司荣鼎咨询和名为Stiftung Neue Verantwortung的柏林智库合写的一份报告，中国可能在未来十年占据一类成熟半导体全球产能的一半左右。
"That could create new supply chain vulnerabilities for foreign companies, said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, a co-author of the report.",这可能会给外国公司的供应链制造新的易受攻击点，该报告的合作者扬-彼得·克莱因汉斯说。
"""Putting all of your eggs in one basket is a stupid idea,"" he explained. ""This is a choke point that can be exploited.""","""把所有的鸡蛋放在一个篮子里是愚蠢的主意，""他解释说。""这是一个能被利用的瓶颈问题。"""
"Across China, many local governments are on the brink of insolvency. Some cities have reduced pay for civil servants. Cuts to municipal health insurance have triggered street protests.",中国许多地方的政府正处于破产边缘。一些城市降低了公务员工资。有些城市削减医保福利的做法引发了街头抗议。
"Central government bailouts are a possibility to rescue cities from their deep budget problems, but China hasn't turned to a source of revenue that would be an obvious option in other countries: property taxes.",虽然存在通过中央政府提供紧急财政援助让城市走出严重预算问题的可能性，但中国一直没有使用在其他国家显而易见的财政收入选项:房地产税。
"In China, where the government owns the land, localities almost never tax homeowners to support services like schools. Cities rely instead on selling long-term leases to real estate developers. Revenue from these land sales has plunged in the past year.",中国的土地归政府所有，地方政府基本上不利用房产税的方式支持学校等社会服务项目。城市的财政收入主要来自把土地的开发权通过长期合约卖给房地产开发商，但卖地收入在过去一年里已大幅减少。
"Last month, after a decade-long effort that involved 100,000 workers, China's central government said it had finally figured out who even owns 790 million apartments and other properties. That knowledge means officials in Beijing could start a nationwide property tax system. But they are not expected to do so quickly. The obstacles range from the technical (it would be complicated) to the economic (it would hurt homeowners at a delicate time for the housing market) to the political (it would expose government officials who own many homes.",上个月，在经过了10万名工作人员长达10年的努力之后，中央政府表示，终于弄清楚了一个问题:国内的7.9亿套公寓和其他房地产归谁所有。这意味着政府可以启动一个全国性的房地产征税制度了。但估计他们不会很快这样做。征收房产税的障碍包括技术上的(会相当复杂)、经济上的(会在房地产市场脆弱的时候给房主带来损失)和政治上的(会令拥有多套房地产的政府官员曝光)。
"The idea of introducing a property tax is not new. The Communist Party's Central Committee, in many ways China's highest decision-making body, resolved in 2003: ""When conditions permit, a unified and standardized property tax will be levied on real estate.""","征收房地产税并不是一个新想法。在很多方面算是中国最高决策机构的中共中央委员会早在2003年就作出决定:""条件具备时对不动产开征统一规范的物业税。"""
"Many economists support a real estate tax, notably Lou Jiwei, a retired finance minister who remains an intellectual leader among China's technocrats. ""A real estate tax is the most suitable type of tax as a local tax, and should be piloted as soon as possible after the economy returns to normal growth,"" he wrote in February.","许多经济学家支持征收房地产税，其中具有代表性的人物是曾任财政部长、现已退休的楼继伟，他在中国技术官僚中仍然享有知识领袖的地位。""房地产税是最适合作为地方税的税种，在经济转为正常增长后应尽快开展试点，""他在今年2月写道。"
"Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist China, nationalized China's land from the 1940s through the 1960s, seizing it from affluent families who were killed in large numbers and transferring ownership to the state. Since the 1980s, local governments have covered many of their costs for road construction, school operations and other activities by leasing large blocks of that land to developers.",在20世纪40年代到60年代，共产主义中国的创始人毛泽东将土地从富裕家庭手中夺走(办法包括将土地拥有者大批杀死)，将其所有权交给国家。自20世纪80年代以来，地方政府主要靠将大片土地出租给开发商来维持道路建设、学校运行和其他活动的支出。
"Until last year, sales of land leases accounted for 7 percent of the Chinese economy. By comparison, the average for real estate taxes in the 38 industrialized democracies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is 1.9 percent.",直到去年，出售土地租约的收入曾占中国经济总量的7%。相比之下，经济合作与发展组织的38个工业化民主国家的房地产税收在经济总量中占比的平均值是1.9%。
The United States is particularly reliant on property taxes. Local governments collect 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product each year through these taxes and spend much of it to pay for public schools.,美国尤其依赖房地产税。美国地方政府每年征收的房地产税占国内生产总值的3%，这些税收的大部分用于公立学校的开支。
"For China, raising money through land leases worked well for a long time. But a slow-motion crash of the housing market has set off bond defaults by dozens of developers, who have been left struggling to finish apartment projects, much less to buy land for new ones.",对于中国来说，地方政府用出租土地的方法筹集资金曾在很长一段时间里运作良好。但房地产市场的缓慢崩溃已导致几十家开发商债券违约，令它们尚未完工的公寓项目难以为继，更不用说为新项目购买土地使用权了。
"Revenue from land sales over the last several decades has allowed China to keep other taxes low. Although China calls itself a socialist country, it has practically no taxes on investment gains, inheritances or personal wealth. National and local governments rely on a regressive combination of heavy sales taxes, salary taxes and business taxes, in addition to the land leases to developers.",过去几十年的土地财政让中国一直保持着较低的其他税收。尽管自称社会主义国家，但中国几乎不对投资收益、遗产或个人财富征税。除了向开发商出租土地，中央和地方政府的收入也依赖累退税收组合，包括高额的销售税、所得税和商业税。
What keeps China from imposing a property tax?,什么原因让中国不征收房地产税?
"Public resistance to a property tax is strong. Apartment owners believe that real estate taxes should be the responsibility of the developers, who have already paid the government handsomely for the land to build housing.",公众对房地产税强烈抵制。公寓业主认为，房地产税应该是开发商的责任，开发商为了在土地上盖楼已经向政府缴纳了一大笔钱。
"""The general complaint is, 'We have already paid so much for an apartment that there is no way we're also going to pay a real estate tax,' "" said Shitong Qiao, a Duke University law professor.","""一个普遍的抱怨是，'我们已经为买房子花了那么多钱，再让我们缴纳房产税，没门儿，'""杜克大学法学教授乔仕彤说。"
"A further difficulty is that local officials, who are in charge of devising a real estate tax, have a lot to lose from one. A perk of civil service jobs has been the chance to buy apartments for little or nothing, particularly during the 1990s.",另一个困难是，负责制定房地产税的地方官员们将产生很多损失。干公务员这行的一个好处是，有机会花很少的钱或根本不花钱得到公寓，尤其是在20世纪90年代。
"With some apartments in big cities selling for several million dollars, and with senior municipal officials earning only $30,000 or $40,000 a year, imposing a 1 percent annual tax could claim their entire incomes. A tax could also expose the wealth of officials who speculated in land.",一些大城市一套公寓的售价高达上千万元人民币，而市政府高级官员的年收入只有二三十万元，如果对房地产征收1%的税，那将占掉他们一年的全部收入。征收房地产税还会将投机土地的官员的财富公之于众。
Introducing a property tax could drive down housing prices at a time when construction in all but the largest cities is weak. Many homeowners are already worried about losing money on their apartments.,引入房地产税还可能会压低房价，目前所有的房地产项目都处于疲软状态，除几个大城市外。许多房主已担心他们的公寓会赔钱。
"""The smaller cities have a greater need for property taxes to balance their budget deficits, but their housing markets are also not as strong as in the big cities,"" said Zhu Ning, a professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance.","""小城市为平衡预算赤字，更需要征收房产税，但小城市的房地产市场不如大城市的那么强劲，""上海高级金融学院教授朱宁说。"
What could China do to start taxing real estate?,中国为开征房地产税能做些什么?
"Last year, the central government studied whether to introduce a ""mansion tax"" on the largest and fanciest apartments and houses in China, said two people familiar with China's economic policymaking who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the subject publicly.","中央政府去年曾研究过是否对中国最大、最豪华的公寓和住宅征收""豪宅税""的问题，两名熟悉中国经济政策制定的人士说，由于没有公开讨论这个问题的授权，他们要求不具名。"
"But a mansion tax has not advanced because of concern that it could damage already fragile confidence in the housing market, both of the people said.",但由于担心可能损害房地产市场本已脆弱的信心，豪宅税的问题未能取得进展，这两名人士说。
A long-term option suggested by overseas experts like Professor Qiao is to require apartment owners to start paying taxes when the original land leases for their buildings expire.,乔仕彤等海外专家建议的一个长远解决办法是，要求公寓业主在建公寓的原始土地租约到期后开始缴纳房产税。
"A few early land leases after Mao's death were for as little as 20 years, and have expired.",一些毛泽东去世后不久出售的土地租约只有20年的使用时间，其使用权已经到期。
But most recent residential land leases have been for 70 years. Waiting decades to tax many apartments would not help China deal with its current fiscal crisis.,但更近的住宅用地租约有70年的使用时间。等几十年后才对许多公寓征收房产税不能帮助中国应对当前的财政危机。
"Jia Kang, a former finance ministry research director who still advises the ministry, said that completing the real estate registration system meant China was nonetheless making progress toward someday enacting a real estate tax.",曾在财政部的一个研究所担任所长、目前仍为财政部顾问的贾康说，完成不动产登记制度意味着中国仍在朝着有朝一日征收不动产税的方向迈进。
"""The unified registration of real estate is the most basic prerequisite for optimizing the management of the real estate market,"" he said. ""It will also play a role in supporting a future real estate tax.""","""不动产统一登记是优化房地产市场管理的最基本前提，""他说。""这也将在支持未来的房地产税方面发挥作用。"""
One by one the tour buses descended on the blue collar neighborhood in Hong Kong known as To Kwa Wan literally translated as Potato Bay unloading throngs of travelers from mainland China outside large restaurants where a quick lunch awaited them inside.,旅游巴士一辆接一辆地来到香港蓝领社区土瓜湾，在大餐厅外面卸下成群的中国内地游客，他们是来这里吃简餐的。
"Outfitted in white, red and orange ball caps to denote which tour they belonged to, the visitors crowded the sidewalks, smoked cigarettes under a ""No Smoking"" sign and bumped into the glass storefront of a real estate office where Nicky Lam, a property agent, was rolling her eyes.","游客们头上戴着白色、红色、橙色的棒球帽，帽子的颜色表明他们属于哪个旅游团。他们挤满了人行道，有人在""禁止吸烟""的标志下抽烟，有人冲进一家房地产办公室的玻璃门，坐在办公室里的房地产经纪人妮基·林(音)对这一切颇为恼火。"
"""They're very loud,"" Ms. Lam said, complaining that some of the tourists used her office bathroom and water cooler without asking.","""他们很吵，""林女士说，她抱怨有些游客不问可否，就随便用她办公室里的卫生间和饮水机。"
"""One tourist came in and asked for restaurant recommendations,"" she added. ""I stared at him and said, 'This is a real estate office.'""","""有游客进来问我有什么好吃的推荐，""她补充道。""我看着他说，'这里是做地产的。'"""
The return of budget mainland tour groups in recent months for the first time since China's borders were closed by the pandemic in early 2020 has revived old tensions in a city transformed by Beijing's political crackdown.,新冠病毒大流行2020年初暴发后，中国曾关闭边境。内地的低价旅行团近几个月才重回香港，让这座因中国政府的政治镇压而改变的城市重新燃起了曾经的紧张气氛。
"Before the pandemic, an influx of mainlanders and their wealth into Hong Kong sent prices and rents soaring, fueling frustrations among the city's residents that sometimes spilled over into outright bigotry. In the nearly three years since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law over Hong Kong to assert its political dominance, criticism of the mainland has often been muted.",内地人和他们的财富曾在疫情前涌入香港，导致了当地的房价和租金飙升，加剧了香港居民的不满情绪，这种情绪有时甚至演变成公然的歧视。自从近三年前，中国政府为维护自己的政治主导地位，对香港实施覆盖范围广泛的国家安全法以来，这里已经不大听得到批评内地的声音。
"Now, the public response to the budget tourists arriving on packages that cost as little as $175 for a two-day visit has been less than welcoming, and at times, downright rude.",现在，对花钱少的游客，香港公众的反应已谈不上热情，有时甚至极为粗鲁，这些游客参加的是两天只花175美元的旅游团。
"Local residents alsosay the tourists who tend to travel in groups of two dozen or more are too noisy, aresnarling traffic and areblighting public spaces by squatting and dining on boxed lunches outdoors. One group offended local sensibilities by slurping cup noodles outside a public toilet in Repulse Bay, a beach redoubt of multimillion-dollar homes.",当地居民还说，这些动辄二三十人的旅行团太吵，妨碍交通，还有人蹲在外面吃盒饭，有碍观瞻。在数百万美元豪宅的藏身之地浅水湾，有旅游团在一个公共厕所外大声吃着杯面，颇让当地人难堪。
"Even some members of Hong Kong's legislature, which is fully stacked with pro-Beijing lawmakers, have lost patience.",就连全部由亲北京人士组成的香港立法会的一些议员也失去了耐心。
"""Can we have some good quality tour groups?"" Kitson Yang asked his colleagues during a recent legislative session while holding up printed pictures of the tourists deluging parts of the city.","""我们能不能有一些优质旅行团呢?""杨永杰在最近一次立法会上问同事们，他手中举着涌入香港部分地区的游客的照片。"
"Before the pandemic, mainland visitors powered Hong Kong tourism, comprising nearly 80 percent of all arrivals in 2018. After the city imposed some of the strictest pandemic measures in the world, restaurants, hotels and shops in Hong Kong were starved for business. The arrival of the budget tours coincides with the government's push to revive tourism in the city of 7.5 million residents. Largely because of a lack of flights, though, high-spending tourists have stayed away,.",在疫情前，内地游客是香港旅游业的主力军，占了2018年香港入境游客的近80%。疫情暴发后，香港采取了一些世界上最严格的防控措施，当地的餐馆、酒店和商店没了生意。低价团是在政府努力重振这座750万人口城市的旅游业时到来的。但在相当程度上由于缺少航班，高消费的游客一直没有出现。
"Budget mainlandtourists don't face that problem because they travel by bus or boat. But local business owners have complained about their spending habits, which typically amount to a few minor purchases in local pharmacies akin to visiting New York and coming away with a tube of Neosporin from Walgreens.",来自内地的穷游旅行客不受航班限制，因为他们是坐大巴或轮船来的。但当地企业主们对这些游客的消费习惯颇有微词，他们常常只在当地药店里买点儿什么，就像是去纽约玩的人只从沃尔格林店买走一管新孢菌素。
"""Budget tourists are mainly older people. They don't spend much,"" William Chong, the operator of a pharmacy in Kowloon, said recently after emerging from a six-minute burst of activity in his store the amount of time tour guides allot each group for shopping in any one store.","""低价团大部分是老人家，他们不会花太多钱，""九龙一家药店的经营者威廉·张(音)不久前在经历了六分钟的忙乱后说道，那是导游分配给旅游团在每家店的购物时间。"
"In the pharmacy, the visitors swept up ointments and instant coffee, but left high-value goods like ginseng untouched.",游客们把药店里的药膏和速溶咖啡一扫而空，但无人过问人参等高价商品。
"On online anti-government forums, the tour groups are providing fodder for ridicule, harkening back to the days when some local residents would openly use the slur ""locusts"" to refer to mainlanderswho traveled to Hong Kong to buy cheaper powdered baby formula, medicine and cosmetics to resell in China.","在网上的反政府论坛上，这些旅游团正在提供讥笑的素材，让人想起以前有当地民众公开用""蝗虫""一词辱骂来港购物内地人的事情，当时许多内地人批量购买售价比内地低的婴儿奶粉、药品和化妆品，将其带回大陆转销。"
"The taunting works both ways. Mainland users of Douyin, the domestic Chinese version of TikTok, have been making hidden camera-style videos mocking Hong Kongers' poor command of Mandarin, in the predominantly Cantonese-speaking city. Others have posted videos of instances they felt slighted by restaurant staff for using Mandarin.",讥笑是双向的。TikTok中文版抖音的内地用户们一直在制作隐藏摄像头式的视频，嘲笑香港人糟糕的普通话(香港人主要说粤语)。还有人发布了他们认为是因为自己在饭馆里使用普通话，受到服务员冷落的视频。
"Miu Wang, a tour guide, was recentlyon the second deck of a white-and-pink car ferry in Victoria Harbor that had been converted into a floating restaurant. She watched over dozens of mainlanders tucking into a modest spread that included egg drop soup, stir fried lettuce and a braised chicken and potato dish that was mostly potato.",导游米尤·王(音)最近在维多利亚港一艘用白色和粉红色汽车渡轮改造成的水上餐厅的二层甲板上，看着几十名内地游客狼吞虎咽地吃着几道普通菜，包括蛋花汤、炒生菜，以及一道基本都是土豆的土豆烧鸡肉。
"A 20-year veteran of the business, she said Hong Kongers were snobs.",她已经在旅游业干了20年，她说香港人自命高雅。
"""I need to take care of dozens of visitors at once, ""Ms. Wang said about complaints that the tourists exhibit boorish behavior. ""I can't control each of them.""","""我一次要照顾几十个游客，""王女士在谈到有关游客行为粗鲁的投诉时说。""我不可能管得住每个人。"""
"The city's tourism minister, Kevin Yeung, has urged residents to be more accommodating, even while calling for stricter oversight of visitors.",香港旅游局长杨润雄呼吁民众采取更容纳的态度，同时呼吁对游客加强监管。
"""Tourists will make the street crowded, but it is a signal of economic growth,"" Mr. Yeung said in a recent television interview. ""Hong Kong people have been known to be welcoming. It is the time to show this spirit again.""","""游客会让街道拥挤，但这是经济发展的表现，""杨润雄最近在一次电视采访中说。""香港人过往是有好客之道的，是时候把这个精神拿出来了。"""
"To deal with the increased crowds, traffic police now direct buses in neighborhoods like To Kwa Wan. Crowd control barriers on sidewalks funnel tourists toward restaurants.",为了应对不断增多的人群，政府派警察到土瓜湾等地方指挥巴士交通，还在人行道上设置了控制人群的障碍物，将游客引向餐馆。
"""I wanted to travel here the last three years but I couldn't because of the pandemic,"" said Zhang Zhanbin, 43, from Hebei Province in China's north, who was visiting Hong Kong for the first time on a four-day tour that cost about $400.","""之前疫情三年其实我也想来，但是没来成，""来自中国河北省的游客、现年43岁的张占斌说，这是他第一次来香港，四天的旅行费用大约400美元。"
"Mr. Zhang, a mustachioed rubber factory worker, said he could care less about the complaints because Hong Kong was back in Chinese hands, and not a British colony.",在橡胶厂当工人的张先生留着大鬈曲八字胡，他一点也不在乎那些抱怨，因为香港回到了中国人手里，不再是英国殖民地。
"""I'm not too worried about Hong Kong people discriminating against us."" he said. ""After all, Hong Kong has been returned.""","""我没太担心香港人对我们的歧视，""他说。""毕竟香港都回归了嘛。"""
"Hong Kong was supposed to maintain a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after its return to Chinese rule in 1997. The protests that engulfed the city in 2019 were aimed at preserving those freedoms, and ultimately failed. Signs of the city's authoritarian turn now dot the urban landscape, from the billboards promoting National Security Education Day to the banners extolling the words of China's top leader, Xi Jinping.",香港是1997年回归中国的，本该在回归后保持50年的高度自治。2019年席卷香港的抗议活动本来是为了维护这些自由，但最终以失败告终。香港转向专制的迹象在这座城市现在到处可见，从宣传国家安全教育日的广告牌，到颂扬中国最高领导人习近平讲话的横幅。
"Those changes have made Hong Kong more attractive to mainland visitors like Guo Xiuli, a 56-year-old retired state worker from the southern city of Chaozhou, who spent a recent morning taking photographs in Golden Bauhinia Square, a popular tourist site near the heart of the financial district.",这些变化已让香港对内地游客更有吸引力，比如来自南方城市潮州的退休公务员、现年56岁的郭秀丽(音)，最近的一个上午她在靠近市中心金融区的热门旅游景点金紫荆广场拍照。
"Ms. Guo, who was not a member of a budget tour group, said she had been treated with more respect compared with her first visit to Hong Kong in 2004, when she felt that speaking Mandarin made her a target of bigotry.",郭女士参加的不是经济型旅游团。她说，与2004年第一次来香港相比，她这次受到了更多的尊重。那次来香港时，她觉得说普通话让她成为偏见的对象。

"For weeks, little was known about why prominent international consulting firms in China were being raided by the police.

"Now, the motivation behind the raids, which included American firms such as theMintz GroupandBain & Companyand most recently Capvision Partners, a consulting company with headquarters in New York and Shanghai, is beginning to come to light after state media on Monday revealed a multiagency crackdown on the consulting industry in the name of national security.",突击搜查的对象包括美思明智和贝恩咨询等美国公司，以及最近的凯盛融英——一家总部位于纽约和上海的咨询公司。现在，在国家媒体周一披露了以国家安全的名义对咨询业进行的多部门联合打击之后，这些突击搜查行动背后的动机开始浮出水面。
"Beijing has also moved to limit the availability of financial data to foreign customers and expanded an already sweeping counterespionage law. In the business community, concern is growing that more Chinese commercial information could be swept up in the intensifying geopolitical rivalry with the United States that has frustrated China, particularly over losing access to advanced American semiconductors.",北京还采取行动限制外国客户可以获取的金融数据，并扩大了一部涵盖范围本已经很广的反间谍法。在商业界，人们越来越担心更多的中国商业信息可能被卷入与美国不断加剧的地缘政治竞争中，这种竞争使中国感到不满，特别是在失去获得美国先进半导体的机会方面。
"Using language that echoed the recent denunciation of the West by China's top leader, Xi Jinping, China's state broadcaster, CCTV, accused Western countries of stealing intelligence information in key industries, including defense, finance, energy and health, as part of a ""strategy of containment and suppression against China.""","中国国家广播机构中央电视台的措辞与中国最高领导人最近对西方的谴责相呼应，指责西方国家窃取关键行业的情报信息，包括国防、金融、能源和卫生，作为""对华遏制打压战略""的一部分。"

"The campaign threatens to undercut Beijing's attempts to persuade foreign businesses to reinvest in China and help revive an economy still trying to climb back after large parts of it had been effectively closed to the world by tough anti-Covid restrictions. New data released by the Chinese government on Tuesday showed a steep decline in imports last month, another sign that growth remains fragile.",为了帮助仍在竭力复苏的经济，北京试图说服外国企业重新开始投资中国，而这场运动有可能削弱这一努力。此前，因严厉的新冠限制措施，中国大部分地区的经济基本上对世界关闭。中国政府周二公布的新数据显示，上月进口急剧下降，这是增长依然脆弱的又一个迹象。
"""Whatever China's gaining by restricting 'sensitive' information is not worth the reputational costs China is paying with foreign businesses,"" said Gerard DiPippo, asenior fellowat the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior U.S. intelligence officer, who added that the raids ""will have a chilling effect, especially with investors and local staff employed by U.S. firms.""","战略与国际研究中心高级研究员、前美国高级情报官员杰拉德·迪皮波表示:""中国通过限制敏感信息获得的任何好处，跟在外国企业当中付出的声誉代价比起来都是不值得的，""他还说，突击搜查""会产生寒蝉效应，尤其是对投资者和美国公司雇用的当地员工""。"
"The crackdown is shining a spotlight on a sprawling industry of due-diligence and business intelligence firms that sprang up along with China's rise to help make sense of the country's lucrative, but often opaque, economy.",打击行动使人们注意到一个由尽职调查和商业情报公司组成的庞大行业，这些公司随着中国的崛起而兴盛，帮助外界了解中国利润丰厚但往往不透明的经济。
"Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in a statement that the organization was ""concerned"" by the raids.

"Officers raided several of the firm's offices in China, including in Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou and Shenzhen, state media said, adding that the company was not ""earnestly fulfilling the responsibilities and obligations"" of preventing espionage.","官方媒体称，官员突击搜查了凯盛在中国的几个办事处，包括上海、北京、苏州和深圳，并解释称该公司没有""认真履行反间谍安全防范责任义务""。"
Capvision did not respond to requests for comment.,凯盛没有立即回应置评请求。

"In March, Mintz, which specializes in corporate investigations, said that Chinese authorities had raided its offices, detained five of its Chinese staff and closed the branch. Last month, Bain said security officials had visited its offices and questioned employees.",今年3月，专门从事企业调查的美思明智集团表示，中国当局突击搜查了其办公室，拘捕了五名中国员工，并关闭了该分公司。上个月，贝恩公司表示，安全官员前往其办公室，对员工进行了询问。
"The police told Jiangsu Television, a state broadcaster, that Capvision had frequently contacted ""secret-related personnel"" in the Chinese Communist Party as well as officials in fields such as defense and science. The authorities accused Capvision of hiring consulting experts ""with high remuneration"" to ""illegally obtain various types of sensitive data,"" which they said posed a ""major risk and hidden peril to China's national security.""","警方告诉官方电视台江苏广电总台，凯盛经常联系中共的""涉密人员""以及国防和科学等领域的官员。当局指责凯盛以""高额报酬""雇佣咨询专家""非法获取我国各类敏感数据""，称其""对我国家安全构成了重大风险隐患""。"
"The CCTV report said the inquiry resulted in the arrest of at least one employee of a state-owned company who was sentenced to six years in prison for providing ""state secrets and intelligence"" to Capvision's foreign clients.","中国央视报道称，调查导致一家国有企业的至少一名员工被捕，他因向凯盛的外国客户提供""国家秘密、情报""而被判处六年监禁。"
"The image of the employee, surnamed Han, was blurred in an interview with the state broadcaster and appeared to be wearing a prison uniform. He said he initially refused to provide Capvision with what he described as ""secret information,"" but that he changed his mind when the firm offered to double his consultancy fee. The report did not describe what company or industry the employee worked for.","这位接受官方媒体采访的员工姓韩，他似乎穿着囚服，样貌经过模糊处理。他说他最初拒绝向凯盛提供他所说的""保密信息""，但当该公司提出将他的咨询费加倍时，他改变了主意。该报道没有明确表明这名员工在哪个公司或行业工作。"
"Last month, China's newly revised counterespionage law expanded the definition of what could be construed as spying, a reflection of Mr. Xi's heightened security state. The law alarmed foreign businesses and governments because it stipulated that sharing ""documents, data, materials and objects"" could be considered spying if the information had ""a bearing on national security and interests,"" a criteria seen as overly broad and potentially arbitrary.","上个月，中国新修订的反间谍法扩大了对间谍活动的定义，这反映了习近平对国家安全的强调。该法令外国企业和政府感到震惊，因为它规定，如果含有""涉及国家安全和利益""的信息，分享""文件、数据、材料和物品""可被视为间谍活动，这一标准被认为过于宽泛，而且可能导致武断的裁决。"
"The revisions signal Beijing's renewed focus on limiting the flow of what it considers sensitive information to foreign investors and governments. China hascurtailed foreign accessto its biggest academic database that distributes research papers, dissertations and statistics, while there are reports that access to the country's database of corporate registrations had beenrestrictedfor some overseas users.",这些修订表明，中国政府愈发重视限制其认为敏感的信息流向外国投资者和政府。中国已经限制了外国对其最大的学术数据库的访问，该数据库发布研究论文、学位论文和统计数据，同时有报道称，一些海外用户在访问中国的企业注册数据库时受到限制。
China is locked in a standoff with the United States over restrictions on microchip technology and growing unease about Chinese dominance of materials and components used in the production of electric vehicles. The free flow of goods helped build a global supply chain that tethered the United States and China as economic partners if not geopolitical allies but those ties have now been frayed.,美国对中国限制微芯片技术，并对中国在电动汽车生产中使用的材料和部件的主导地位感到日益不安，中美由此陷入对峙。货物的自由流动有助于建立一个全球供应链，将美国和中国联系在一起成为经济伙伴——即使不是地缘政治盟友——但这些关系现在已被破坏。
"Capvision was founded in 2006 by former Bain consultants and Morgan Stanley investment bankers and is based in New York and Shanghai with 700 employees, according to the company's website.",凯盛的网站显示，该公司由曾在贝恩工作的咨询师和前摩根士丹利的投行人士于2006年创立，在纽约和上海有700名员工。

"In the United States, such firms were targeted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2011 as part of a crackdown on insider trading at hedge funds. In those cases, the firms were often used to pass on nonpublic information about companies' earnings and strategies to gain a trading advantage. Such firms have largely faded from public view in the United States.",在美国，这些公司成为2011年美国证券交易委员会的对冲基金内幕交易打击行动的目标。在这些案件中，这些公司通常被用来传递有关公司收益和战略的非公开信息，以获得交易优势。此后这些公司在美国基本上已经从公众视野中消失了。

"BEIJING The hospital in southern Beijing advertised itself as specializing in vascular tumors, especially benign birthmarks that often appear in infants.",北京——这家位于北京南部的医院宣传自己专门治疗血管肿瘤，尤其是经常出现在婴儿身上的良性胎记。
"But when a fire broke out there last month, killing at least 29 people, many of the victims had been there for another reason: They were older people with disabilities receiving nursing care, some of them staying at the private hospital for months or even years, even though it was not licensed as a provider of long-term elder care.",但是，在上个月该医院那场造成至少29人死亡的火灾中，许多受害者是因为另一个原因来到这里:他们是接受护理的失能老年人，其中一些人在这家私立医院待了几个月甚至几年，尽管该医院没有提供长期老年护理的资质。
"The tragedy at Changfeng Hospital the deadliest fire in China's capital in more than two decades has renewed scrutiny of a long-running problem. China's population is rapidly aging, with 400 million people, nearly 30 percent of the population, expected to be over 60 by 2040. But medical resources have not kept up; there were only about eight million nursing home or elder care beds at the end of 2020, according to official statistics.",长峰医院的悲剧是20多年来中国首都发生的最严重火灾，它令人们再次审视一个长期存在的问题。中国人口正在迅速老龄化，预计到2040年将有4亿人超过60岁，占总人口的近30%。但医疗资源并没有跟上;根据官方统计数据，截至2020年底，只有大约800万个养老院或老年护理床位。
"The authorities have recognized the urgency of addressing the shortage, with Beijing's latest five-year plan pledging to raise that number to nine million beds by 2025. But many obstacles remain.",当局已经意识到解决这一短缺问题的紧迫性，北京最新的五年计划承诺，到2025年将床位数量提高到900万张。但仍存在许多障碍。
"Social stigmas against retirement or nursing facilities are still widespread in a culture that emphasizes children's caretaking duties toward their parents. Even for people who are willing to embrace care institutions, public facilities often have long waiting lists, and private ones which are not covered by public medical insurance can be prohibitively expensive.",在一个强调子女对父母照顾责任的文化中，对退休或护理机构的社会污名仍然普遍存在。即使愿意接受护理机构，公共机构往往有很长的等待名单，而私人机构——不在公共医疗保险范围内——可能贵得令人望而却步。
"And then there is the problem of facilities becoming properly licensed to offer nursing care in the first place, a process complicated by bureaucratic requirements and a dearth of trained staff, according to experts. As a result, some private companies that want to meet the demand for senior care operate underground.",专家表示，还有一个问题是，医疗机构首先要获得提供护理服务的资质，这个过程因官僚主义的要求和缺乏训练有素的工作人员变得复杂。因此，一些想要满足老年人护理需求的私营公司选择了地下运作。
"Local officials are now investigating whether Changfeng Hospital was illegally offering long-term elder care, according to state media reports. Some people who escaped the blaze told Chinese media that some patients' limited mobility may have contributed to the death toll.",据官方媒体报道，当地官员正在调查长峰医院是否非法提供长期老年人护理。一些从大火中逃生的人告诉中国媒体，一些病人行动不便可能是造成大量死亡的原因之一。
There is no clear link between the potentially unlicensed care and the fire; deadly fires have also broken out at licensed nursing homes. But the fire has drawn public attention to the underground market and the reasons for its existence.,可能存在的无护理资质问题和火灾之间没有明确的联系;有资质的养老院也曾发生致命的火灾。但这场火灾引起了公众对地下市场及其存在原因的关注。
Some victims' relatives and public health experts have urged the authorities to look beyond punishment and toward bringing the providers out of the shadows.,一些受害者亲属和公共卫生专家敦促当局不要只顾惩罚，而是要让这些服务提供者从阴影之下现身。
"""This is just the peak of the iceberg,"" said Sabrina Luk Ching Yuen, a professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who studies aging, adding that there were likely many similar cases of underground care. ""If the market is there, what is the government trying to do?""","""这只是冰山一角，""新加坡南洋理工大学研究老龄化问题的教授陆贞元说。她还表示，类似的地下护理案例可能还有很多。""如果这方面有市场，那么政府想做什么?"""
"Efforts by The New York Times to reach victims or their relatives directly were unsuccessful. Changfeng Hospital has been closed to visitors since the fire, and when Times reporters tried to interview victims or their relatives at other hospitals where the injured were transferred, they were blocked or escorted out by hospital staff.",《纽约时报》试图直接联系受害者或其亲属，但没有成功。自火灾发生以来，长峰医院一直不对访客开放，时报记者试图在其他医院采访伤者或其亲属时遭到了医院工作人员阻止或带离。
"The authorities, as is common after disasters in China, have tried to control the narrative and prevent reporters from speaking with victims. They have said only that the patients who died ranged from 40 to 88 years old, with an average age of 71, and that most of the 21 seriously injured patients had chronic diseases.",当局试图控制报道，并阻止记者与受害者交谈，这在中国发生灾难后很常见。当局只是表示，死亡的病人年龄从40岁到88岁不等，平均年龄为71岁，21名重伤者中大多数患有慢性病。
"But some Chinese news outlets managed to interview relatives of Changfeng Hospital patients, who described an elderly father who had been there since last summer because of disabilities after a cerebral hemorrhage, and another man, 76, who had no motor skills and lived there full time.",但一些中国新闻媒体设法采访了长峰医院病人的亲属，他们描述了一位年迈的父亲，因为脑溢血导致失能，他从去年夏天开始就住在那里;还有一位76岁的老人，已失去行动能力，一直住在那里。
"The relatives reportedly said they were drawn to the hospital because of its ability to provide medical care for their loved ones with disabilities. In contrast, nursing homes in China historically have provided little to no medical care.",据报道，亲属们说，他们选择这家医院是因为它能够为他们的失能亲人提供医疗服务。相比之下，中国的养老院历来很少，甚至不提供医疗服务。
"The relatives also appreciated that bed turnover was less of a concern at private hospitals, which, though significantly more expensive than public ones, were less crowded. According to one report, one woman said that her father had been forced to shuttle between several different institutions before she found Changfeng Hospital.",亲属们还表示，私立医院不那么在意床位周转率的问题，它们比公立医院贵得多，但病房没那么拥挤。根据一份报告，一名女性说，在她找到长峰医院之前，她的父亲辗转更换了几家设施。
"That woman said she was paying about $870 a month in nursing fees for her father. Some online advertisements for a nursing facility at the same address as Changfeng Hospital listed fees as high as $1,400 a month. The average monthly pension in Beijing was 4,157 yuan, or about $600, in 2019.",她说她每个月要为父亲支付大约6000元的护理费。一些与长峰医院有着相同地址的护理机构的网络广告显示，收费高达每月10000元左右。2019年，北京人均月养老金为4157元。
"Private hospitals have many incentives to try to capitalize on the unmet demand for long-term medical care, said Bei Wu, a professor of global health at New York University who has studied aging in China. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, many struggled to draw enough patients to make money, because of their heftier price tags.",纽约大学研究中国老龄化问题的全球健康教授吴蓓表示，私立医院有很多动机去利用未得到满足的长期医疗护理需求。甚至在新冠大流行之前，许多私立医院就已经难以吸引到足够多的病人，因为它们价格更高。
"Then, under China's three years of strict Covid restrictions, people who could avoid hospitals did so. Out-of-town patients, who often traveled to major cities like Beijing for care, dwindled as the country sought to limit movement.",然后，在中国三年严格的新冠限制下，人们尽量避免去医院。随着国家试图限制人们的行动，经常前往北京等大城市寻求治疗的外地患者减少了。
"The publicly traded parent company of Changfeng Hospital lost more than $14 million between 2020 and the first half of 2022, according to public filings. It did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",公开文件显示，从2020年到2022年上半年，长峰医院的上市母公司亏损近1亿元。该公司没有回应多次置评请求。
"""I can see some ways this pushed private hospitals to say, 'Hey, we can provide the care for these older adults with disabilities because this can be a potential revenue-generating source,'"" Dr. Wu said.","""我可以看出，这在某种程度上促使私立医院说，'对啊，我们可以为这些失能老年人提供护理，因为这可能是一个潜在的创收来源，'""吴蓓说。"
"The government has, in fact, promoted the integration of medical and elder care, encouraging nursing homes to build medical facilities and hospitals to offer more nursing services.",事实上，政府已经推动医疗和养老的融合，鼓励养老院建设医疗设施和医院，提供更多护理服务。
"But China, like many countries, has a dire shortage of staff trained to care specifically for older patients. And the government departments that oversee medical care and nursing care are separate, further slowing the approval process, said Professor Luk, in Singapore.",但与许多国家一样，中国严重缺乏受过老年患者照护训练的工作人员。新加坡的陆贞元表示，监管医疗和护理的政府部门是分开的，这进一步放慢了审批过程。
"""The intention is good,"" she said of the integration plan. ""But, in reality, it's really hard to implement.""","""意图是好的，""她谈到整合计划时说。""但在现实中，这确实很难实施。"""
"She said she hoped one outcome of the fire in Beijing would be a call to action for the government: Either it should provide more long-term care facilities itself, or make it easier for private companies to do so.",她说，她希望北京大火的一个结果是呼吁政府采取行动:要么政府自己提供更多长期护理设施，要么让私营公司更容易做到这件事。
"Indeed, the need is only going to grow. The number of older Chinese with disabilities is expected to more than double this decade, reaching 100 million by 2030, according to official statistics.",事实上，这种需求只会越来越大。据官方统计，中国失能老年人的数量预计将在这个十年增加一倍以上，到2030年达到1亿。
"The facilities are especially important to the lucky few who have found spaces for their relatives there. Hua Ailing, a post office accountant in a small county in Anhui Province, chose to send her 89-year-old mother to a private hospital licensed for long-term care last year, after her mother lost the ability to walk. She said she felt more comfortable sending her there than to a traditional nursing home, where medical care could be unreliable.",这些设施对于为亲人在那里找到住处的少数幸运者来说尤其重要。华爱玲(音)是安徽省一个小县城的邮局会计。去年，在89岁的母亲失去行动能力后，她选择将母亲送到一家有长期护理资质的私立医院。她说，把母亲送到那里比送到传统的养老院更让人放心，因为后者的医疗服务可能靠不住。
"If the option had not existed, she and her siblings would not have known what to do. ""After a time, we couldn't care for her ourselves,"" Ms. Hua said. ""After all, we're all in our 60s, too.""","如果没有这个选择，她和她的兄弟姐妹就不知道该怎么做了。""再过一段时间，我们自己也照顾不了她了，""华爱玲说。""毕竟，我们也都是60多岁的人了。"""
"A heartbreaking video of a retiree that showed what groceries she could buy with 100 yuan, or $14.50 roughly her monthly pension and sole source of income went viral on the Chinese internet. The video was deleted.",一条令人痛心的视频在中国互联网上疯转，一位退休老人展示她用100元——大约是她一个月的养老金，也是她的唯一收入来源——可以买到些什么菜。视频随后被删除。
"A singer vented the widespread frustration among young, educated Chinese about their dire finances and gloomy job prospects, like gig work. ""I wash my face every day, but my pocket is cleaner than my face,"" he sings. ""I went to college to help rejuvenate China, not to deliver meals."" His song was banned and his social media accounts were suspended.","受过教育的年轻人对惨淡的财务和就业前景——比如打零工——的普遍不满，这些都在一位歌手的作品中得到了抒发，""虽然我每天都洗脸，但口袋比脸还干净，""他唱道。""读书是为了中华崛起，而不是去送外卖快递。""他的歌被封禁，社交媒体帐号被删。"
"A migrant worker toiling to support his family gained widespread sympathy and attention last year after he tested positive for Covid, and officials released extensive details of his movements. He became known as the hardest-working person in China. Censors blocked discussions about him, and local authorities were stationed outside his house to prevent journalists from visiting his wife.","去年，一位民工感染新冠后的行踪被官方事无巨细地发布，他为了养家糊口而四处奔波的事迹因此引起了广泛的同情与关注。他被称为""最辛苦的中国人""。审查者屏蔽了有关他的讨论，地方当局派人守在他家门外，阻止记者探访他的妻子。"
"China says it is a socialist country that aims to promote common prosperity. In 2021, its top leader, Xi Jinping, declared ""a comprehensive victory in the battle against poverty."" Yet many people remain poor or live just above the poverty line. With the country's economic prospects dimming and the people's increasing anxiety about their future, poverty has become a taboo subject that can draw ire from the government.","中国自称是一个以实现共同富裕为目标的社会主义国家。2021年，最高领导人习近平宣布""脱贫攻坚战取得了全面胜利""。然而还是有许多人处于贫困中或生活在贫困线以下。随着该国经济前景日渐黯淡，人们对未来越来越感到焦虑，贫困成了一个禁忌话题，可能会招致政府的愤怒。"
"In March, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet regulator, announced that it would crack down on anyone who publishes videos or posts that ""deliberately manipulate sadness, incite polarization, create harmful information that damages the image of the Party and the government, and disrupts economic and social development."" It bans sad videos of old people, disabled people and children.","3月，中国互联网监管机构国家互联网信息办公室宣布，将对发布视频或文章刻意""渲染悲情煽动对立，制造损害党和政府形象、干扰经济社会发展""的人予以打击。该行动禁止发布有老人、残障人士和儿童的悲情视频。"
"Behind the ban is a government eager to keep all talk about China positive. The Communist Party brags about how many people it lifted out of poverty in the past four decades, while refusing to mention how it had thrown the entire nation into abject poverty under Mao Zedong.",在这条禁令的背后，政府正迫切希望确保有关中国的讨论都是正面的。中共吹嘘自己在过去四十年里帮助了多少人摆脱贫困，同时又拒绝提及毛泽东治下让整个国家陷入赤贫的往事。
"Poverty alleviation is a medal the party flaunts to claim its legitimacy. But despite China's rise as an economic power, it has a drastically inadequate social safety net, and the government is eager to block any discussion of the conditions poor people face.",扶贫是一枚中共用来彰显其政权合法性的奖章。虽然中国的经济实力蒸蒸日上，其社会保障仍然严重不足，政府决意阻止一切有关穷人困苦境况的讨论。
"Searching the Chinese word ""pinkun,"" or poverty, on the country's biggest news portal, qq.com, the top news item is about research that shows poverty is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.

"Hu Chenfeng recorded the footage that was removed from the Chinese internet. On popular video sites, he had posted a recording showing an elderly woman living on barely $15 a month. In the words of many social media commenters, he was revealing too much. ""This subject is untouchable,"" one commenter wrote on a now-deleted discussion thread on Zhihu, a site similar to Quora. Another wrote, ""His account was censored simply because he showed what life is like for many people.""","那则已在中国互联网上删除的视频是由户晨风拍摄的。他在流行的视频网站上发布了一段视频，展示了一位老太太如何仅靠每月100元的生活费支撑的。用许多社交媒体评论人士的话说，他是在揭露不能揭露的事情。""这个话题是不能碰的，""在知乎上，一个现在已经删除的问答中有人这样写道。另一个人说，""他被炸号只是因为他展现了许多人的生活。"""
"In the video, which survives outside the Chinese internet on YouTube, Mr. Hu interviews the woman, a 78-year-old widow, on the street in the southwestern city of Chengdu. She said she planned to buy only rice, about the only thing she could afford. She hadn't eaten meat for a long time. Tears rolled down her cheeks as she recounted her financial hardship. The two walk through a grocery store. They bought rice, eggs, pork and flour. The bill came to 127 yuan ($18). Mr. Hu insisted on paying.",这条通过YouTube得以在中国互联网以外的地方存活下来的视频中，户晨风在西南城市成都的街头采访了这位78岁的孤寡老人。她说她打算只买大米，这大概是她唯一买得起的东西了。她已经有很长时间没吃到肉。在讲述自己的困境时，眼泪顺着她的脸颊流下。两人一起逛了超市。他们买了米、鸡蛋、猪肉和面粉。最后的账单金额是127元。户晨风坚持由他来买单。
"He was emotional, too, signing off with ""a heavy heart.""","这件事也让他很难过，最后以一句""今天心情有点沉重""结束了视频。"
The video was removed from the two biggest user-generated video platforms in China. Mr. Hu's accounts were suspended.,视频已从中国最大的两家用户生成视频平台上删除。户晨风的账号被封。
"Even a discussion thread on Zhihu about why the government doesn't allow videos about the poor was censored. ""Because theoretically there's no poor people in China,"" one social media user speculated in a written post before the thread disappeared. ""China has eliminated poverty.""","就连知乎上一个关于政府为何不允许播放有关穷人视频的讨论也遭到了审查。""因为理论上中国没有穷人，""一名社交媒体用户在帖子消失前猜测道。""中国已经消除了贫困。"""

"Income inequality is a problem in many countries, including the United States. In China, the biggest divide in wealth is among rural and urban residents. The gap is created by government rules that peg social benefits, including schooling, health care and pensions, to where a person was born, not according to their residence, income or needs. The policy hurts retirees in particular.",收入不平等在包括美国在内的许多国家都是一个问题。在中国，最大的财富差距是在农村和城市居民之间。这一差距是由政府规定造成的，这些规定将包括教育、医疗和养老金在内的社会福利与一个人的出生地挂钩，而不是根据人们的居住地、收入或需求。这项政策对退休人员的伤害尤其大。
"In 2021, older people from the countryside received on average $27 a month in social security benefits, according to a government report. That pension is merely about 5 percent of what the average urban retiree gets.",根据一份政府报告，2021年，来自农村的老年人平均每月领取约180元的社会保障福利。这仅仅是城市退休人员平均养老金的5%。
"One viral video about seniors struggling to make ends meet took place in one of China's most populous provinces, Henan, where the government raised monthly pensions for rural residents from $16 to $18 this year. The video shows two porters in their 70s unloading a truckload of cement using their hands and shoulders.",一段有关老年人难以维持生计的疯传视频是在中国人口最多的省份之一河南拍摄的。今年，河南省政府将农村居民的养老金从每月113元提高到123元。视频显示，两名70多岁的搬运工正在用手和肩膀从一辆卡车上卸水泥。
"In China's go-go years of miraculous economic growth, straddling the 1990s to mid-2010s, poverty wasn't a topic that people paid much attention to. Now, with the country's economic engine sputtering, Chinese who are new to the middle class are worried that they could fall back into poverty, part of the reason these videos attracted attention.",从上世纪90年代到本世纪10年代中期，中国经济出现了奇迹般的快速增长，在这段时间里，贫困并不是人们关注的话题。现在，随着国家的经济引擎熄火，刚进入中产阶级的中国人担心他们可能会重新陷入贫困，这也是这些视频引起关注的部分原因。
"Because of propaganda and censorship, many of them weren't aware of the depth and prevalence of poverty in the country.",由于宣传和审查制度，他们当中许多人都没有意识到这个国家贫困的深度和广度。
"When the premier at the time, Li Keqiang, said in 2020 that 600 million Chinese 40 percent of the population had monthly income of less than $150, some people, who didn't know where the numbers came from, called it fake news. The official People's Daily had to call on the State Statistics Bureau to confirm it was true. The official Chinese press seldom mentioned the inconvenient number again.",2020年，时任总理李克强说，6亿中国人——占中国人口的40%——月收入低于1000元，一些不知道数字来源的人称这是假新闻。官方的《人民日报》只得致电国家统计局证实这一消息的真实性。中国官方媒体很少再提及这个令人难堪的数字。
Another reason poverty is seen as a novelty among the middle class is that local governments usually chase beggars and homeless people off the streets. They become invisible in big cities. A friend's daughter in Beijing asked her last year what a beggar was. I recently met a 13-year-old new Chinese immigrant in San Francisco who was shocked by the sight of homeless people. She said she'd never seen one in Beijing.,贫困在中产阶级中被视为新鲜事物的另一个原因是，地方政府通常会把乞丐和无家可归的人赶离街头。他们在大城市里销声匿迹。去年，一位朋友在北京的女儿问她什么是乞丐。我最近在旧金山遇到了一个13岁的中国新移民，看到无家可归的人，她感到震惊。她说她在北京从来没见过这样的人。
"The Beijing government does not only bar beggars and homeless people from staying in the city. In the winter of 2017, it kicked many low-income people out of their apartments to get rid of what it called ""low-quality population.""","北京政府不仅仅是禁止乞丐和无家可归的人留在城市。2017年冬天，它将许多低收入者赶出了公寓，以摆脱所谓的""低端人口""。"
"Now with video streamers roaming the country, trying to find revealing facts that attract online attention, the public can see the poor and some of the unpleasant aspects of life in China. That is one reason for the censorship.",现在，随着视频直播者在全国各地游走，试图寻找可以曝光的事实来吸引网民注意，公众可以看到中国贫困和生活中一些不愉快的侧面。这就是它们遭到审查的一个原因。
"In addition to poverty, the government doesn't want the public to dwell on another big social problem: youth unemployment, which the government says has reached nearly 20 percent.",除了贫困，政府也不希望公众关注另一个重大的社会问题:青年失业率，政府称已达到近20%。
"A songwriter used a well-known literary character, Kong Yiji, an educated but poor intellectual living during the Qing dynasty, to counter the government line that young people can't find work because they aren't trying hard enough. The song was censored and the singer's online accounts suspended.",一位词曲作者用著名的文学人物孔乙己——一个受过良好教育但生活贫困的清朝知识分子——来反驳政府的说法，即年轻人找不到工作是因为他们不够努力。这首歌遭到审查，歌手的网络账户也被封禁。
"The official media, in turn, churned out articles about college graduates earning decent livings by collecting garbage or becoming street vendors.",另一方面，官方媒体发表了关于大学毕业生通过收废品或在街上摆摊过上体面生活的文章。
"The government wants to ""deny the prevalence of economic recession and unemployment"" and avoid accountability, a commenter wrote.","一位评论者写道，政府想要""否认普遍存在的经济衰退和失业""并避免问责。"
"The same can be said about poverty. By censoring videos and online discussions, the government is evading its responsibility to provide the most basic social safety net to the poor.",贫困也是如此。通过审查视频和网络讨论，政府正在逃避为穷人提供最基本的社会保障的责任。
"""I shot these videos in the hope of making some money while pushing our society to move forward just a little bit,"" Mr. Hu, the videographer, said in a video posted in a backup social media account that had not been blocked. ""But I never expected that this is forbidden.""","""我拍这些视频是希望赚点钱，同时推动我们的社会向前一点点，""拍摄视频的户晨风通过一个未被屏蔽的小号发布视频说。""但我没想到这是被禁止的。"""
"The yurt stood in the middle of a sweeping northern Chinese grassland, beneath a cloudless sky. A reedy folk tune played. Nearby, sheep grazed.",晴朗的天空下，一望无际的中国北方草原中，坐落着一顶毡包。尖利的民乐声响起。不远处有羊儿在吃草。
"Suddenly the livestream, which had been showing the idyllic vista, cut to a man in his 30s, wearing a Mongolian hat with a pointed golden spire. ""Welcome, brothers and sisters!"" he announced from his perch atop a platform bed. ""How's the signal? I set up Wi-Fi in my yurt."" He held up a bag of beef jerky, branded with a cartoon image of his face. ""If it's your first time here, I'm Taiping, and I make beef jerky.""","突然，正在展现这一派恬静美景的直播画面转向了一个三十来岁的男人，他戴着有金色尖顶的蒙古帽。""欢迎兄弟姐妹们!""他坐在一张炕上说道。""卡不卡?我在蒙古包里设了个Wi-Fi。""他拿起一包牛肉干，包装上印有他的卡通形象。""如果第一次来我直播间，太平哥是做牛肉干的。"""
"It was another day at work for Taiping, a Chinese livestreaming salesman. Illuminated by carefully arranged studio lights, speaking into two iPhones propped up on a table, Taiping began wooing the thousands of viewers who tapped into his channel. He dangled unwrapped jerky before the camera, describing traditional Mongolian air-drying techniques. He shredded it with his fingers to show its tenderness.",对中国直播推销员太平来说，这就是一个平常的工作日。在精心安排的演播室灯光下，太平对着固定在桌上的两部iPhone讲话，向成千上万来到他直播间的观众推销产品。他拆出一根牛肉干在镜头前摆弄，讲解传统的蒙古牛肉风干技术。他把牛肉撕成一条条，展现肉质的柔嫩。
"Viewers, by typing comments, sent real-time questions that bubbled from the bottom of the video feed, about how spicy it was or which flavor was best. (Taiping, who read each comment aloud, suggested buying half original, half cumin.) Some longtime fans sent animated pink hearts or thumbs-up symbols, while others simply wanted to say hello. ""I missed you, too,"" Taiping, who like many ethnic Mongolians uses only one name, replied to one viewer.","观众通过文字评论实时提出的问题从画面下方跳出，他们问牛肉干辣不辣，或哪种口味最好吃。(太平大声读出每一条评论，建议搭配着买，原味和孜然味各一半。)有一些老粉丝会发动画红心或大拇指图标，还有些只是来打招呼的。""我也想你啊，""和许多蒙古族人一样只使用名字的太平对一位观众说。"
"By the end of the four-hour session, during which he barely paused to drink water, he had received more than 650 orders, totaling $15,000.",四小时的直播过程里，他甚至很少停下来喝口水，最后一共拿到了超过650份订单，总值约10万元人民币。
"Taiping is one of countless Chinese riding the explosive wave of influencer culture and live online videos in the country to transform the way people buy and sell. Last year alone, an estimated $500 billion in goods were sold via livestream on apps like Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, or Kuaishou, another short video platform an eightfold increase since 2019.",无数像太平这样的中国人正在追逐这股网红文化和网络直播的风潮，它已经彻底改变了这个国家购买和出售商品的方式。仅去年一年，在抖音、快手等短视频平台上出售的商品总额估计就达到了5000亿美元——是2019年的八倍。
"Star streamers have become celebrities.The most famous, including Li Jiaqi whose prowess at trying on and pitching makeup products earned him the nickname ""lipstick king"" areable to attract tens of millions of viewers per session. Kim Kardashian once appeared with another top Chinesestreamer, Viya, to promote her perfume in China, selling 15,000 bottles within minutes.","走红的主播成了名人。这其中，最著名的李佳琦——他因为善于把化妆品用在自己脸上来推销而得到了""口红一哥""的称号——每次直播可以吸引数千万观众。金·卡戴珊曾经出现在另一位中国顶尖主播薇娅的直播中，推广她在中国销售的香水，几分钟内就卖出了15000瓶。"
"The format emerged in China several years ago, then became ubiquitous during the coronavirus pandemic. Now nearly half of China's one billion internet users have tried it, even as it remains largely unfamiliar in the West. To Americans, it may be reminiscent of television shopping but interactive and, as a result, far more compelling.",这种销售形式多年前就已经在中国出现，而后在新冠大流行期间变得无处不在。如今中国的10亿互联网用户有将近一半使用过这种服务，而西方世界多数人对此还很陌生。对美国人来说，这可能让他们想起电视购物——但这是一种有互动的形式，因此也更具吸引力。
"The most successful streams are as much entertainment as they are sales pitches. Hosts hawk everything from makeup to microwaves, in an energetic patter that marries the urgency of an auctioneer with the intimacy of an old friend. They tell jokes and personal anecdotes to hold viewers' attention. They call individual fans by name to earn their trust. They promise exclusive deals to win their dollars.",最成功的主播既是推销员，也是娱乐艺人。他们用急匆匆的、充满活力的语调推销着从化妆品到微波炉的一切，有着拍卖师的紧迫感，同时又像个亲切的老朋友。他们会讲笑话、拉家常，保持观众的注意力。他们会呼唤某些粉丝的名字，赢得他们的信任。他们会承诺提供独家的优惠来提高销量。
"For viewers, the appeal is not only convenience, but also the feeling ofbeing catered to. They can ask a host modeling clothing to show it from a different angle, or inquire how long a snack will keep. They place orders in the stream, never interrupting their favorite host's spiel.",对于观众来说，它的吸引力不仅在于方便，还在于有人招呼的感觉。他们可以要求主持人从不同的角度展示服装，或者询问一种零食的保质期多久。他们在直播间里下单，从不打断他们心爱的主播的滔滔不绝。
"Restaurants, beauty salons, and even car dealerships and property developers now court customers in real time. Global brands from Ikea to Louis Vuitton have paid China's influencers to stream their products. But much of the appeal of this line of business is that anyone can do it: Farmers, factory workers and retirees have joined the frenzy.",无论餐馆、美容院，甚至汽车经销商和房地产开发商，现在都在实时吸引客户。从宜家到路易威登等全球品牌都付钱给中国网红，让他们在网上宣传自己的产品。但这一行的吸引力很大程度上在于任何人都可以做:农民、工厂工人和退休人员都加入了这一热潮。
"Taiping, a former herdsman, now runs his own jerky factory and has more than one million followers. He recently starred in a Kuaishou ad campaign splashed across subway stations in Beijing.",太平曾经是一名牧民，现在经营着自己的牛肉干工厂，拥有超过100万粉丝。他最近登上了快手在北京地铁站的一则广告。
Yet withthe market's breakneck growth has come new challenges. Fierce competition has driven many streamers away. A broader economic slowdown has fueled layoffs at the companies behind the streaming platforms.,然而，随着市场的飞速增长，新的挑战也随之而来。激烈的竞争迫使许多主播离开。更广泛的经济放缓促使流媒体平台背后的公司裁员。
"And the Chinese government, worried that the business was growing too big, too fast, has issued a flood of ever-evolving regulations. Celebrity hosts have abruptly disappeared from view.",中国政府担心该行业发展得太大、太快，出台了大量不断变化的监管规定。一些知名主播突然从人们的视野中消失了。
"The story of livestreaming e-commerce, then, is not only about the rise of a new form of shopping. It is a window into the opportunities and perils of doing business in today's China, as Beijing seeks greater control of private enterprise.",因此，电商直播的故事不仅仅是关于一种新购物形式的兴起。随着北京寻求对私营企业的更大控制，这是一个了解当今中国经商机遇与风险的窗口。
"""The Chinese state is so caught up in this economy; it has a dual goal of boosting development, which is a huge imperative for them, and maintaining stability,"" said Lin Zhang, a media studies professor at the University of New Hampshire who has studied Chinese e-commerce. ""Sometimes, this tension is impossible for them to resolve.""","""这种经济令中国政府非常为难;他们有促进发展的目标，这对他们是当务之急，但他们也有维稳的目标，""研究中国电子商务的新罕布什尔大学媒体研究教授张琳说。""有时候两者的冲突是不可能调和的。"""
A High-Tech New Opportunity,高科技的新机遇
"Growing up, Taiping could hardly have imagined making a fortune by any means, let alone by talking into his phone. Born in the plains of Inner Mongolia, a region in northernChina where temperatures can plummet to minus 20 degrees, he left school after fifth grade, working as a herdsman, security guard and truck driver. He hardly spoke Mandarin, China's dominant language, as his schoolteachers had taught mostly in Mongolian.",从小到大，太平几乎无法想象自己能够通过任何方式发财，更不用说只需要对着手机说话。他出生在中国北方地区内蒙古的草原，那里的气温可以骤降到零下20度。他读完五年级就辍学了，做过牧民、保安和卡车司机。他几乎不会说中国的主要语言普通话，因为他的学校老师大多用蒙古语授课。
"In 2015, noticing that his town's scenic grasslands were attracting tourists, Taiping, then 30 years old, decided to borrow $15,000 to make and sell his own beef jerky. But weeks later, the tourist season ended.",2015年，30岁的太平注意到本镇风景优美的草原正吸引着游客，他决定借10.5万元来制作并出售自己的牛肉干。但几周后，旅游旺季结束了。
Then a friend introduced him to Kuaishou.,后来一个朋友向他介绍了快手。
"The app, pronounced kwai-show, started as China's first short video platform, a place where users shared clips of themselves dancing, cooking or harvesting crops. Taiping quickly saw business potential: Hebegan posting prerecorded videos about his jerky, shipping it to people who messaged him to buy.",这个应用程序最初是中国第一个短视频平台，用户可以在这个平台上分享自己跳舞、做饭或收割庄稼的视频。太平很快就看到了商业潜力:他在上面发布预先录制的视频介绍牛肉干，然后给发信息要求购买的人发货。
"Soon, a different opportunity arose. Kuaishou itself had also been looking for ways to make money, and around the time Taiping joined, it introduced livestreaming. At first, streamers earned money purely by performing, trying to attract fans who could send virtual tips; the platform took a cut. But before long, some streamers began staging outlandish stunts to lure viewers, like eating light bulbs, or discussing topics considered taboo, like teenage pregnancy.",很快，另一种机会出现了。快手本身也一直在寻找赚钱的方法，在太平加入的时候，平台引入了直播功能。起初，主播纯粹靠表演赚钱，试图吸引可以虚拟打赏的粉丝;平台从中抽成。但不久之后，一些主播开始上演一些古怪的噱头来吸引观众，比如吃灯泡，或者讨论少女怀孕等被视为禁忌的话题。
"Chinese officials, alarmed by what they called ""vulgar"" content, ordered the company to clean up. Kuaishou scrambled for a new direction and, in 2018, landed onlive sales. By encouraging streamers to sell products, it could still capitalize on the popularity of livestreaming, but in a more predictable context.","中国官员对这些在他们看来""低俗""的内容感到震惊，命令该公司进行整顿。快手努力寻找新的方向，并在2018年推出了直播销售。通过鼓励流媒体销售产品，这样仍然可以利用直播的流行，但环境变得更为可控。"
"One day, Taiping received a phone callfroma Kuaishou representative, whosaid the company was looking to support rural entrepreneurs. It wanted to help Taiping expand through livestreaming.",一天，太平接到了快手的代表打来的电话，他说快手希望支持农村企业家。它希望通过直播帮助太平把生意做大。
"Taiping hesitated. ""My Mandarin wasn't good,"" he recalled. ""I was nervous. I didn't know how to interact with people.""","太平犹豫了。""我以前汉语说不好，""他回忆说。""我紧张。不知道怎么跟人交流。"""
"But the company offered to fly him to Beijing for training; he had never been on a plane, so he agreed. He received a crash course in public speaking, employee management and trademark registration. Kuaishou, eager to advertise its wholesome new direction, promoted his journey in the media.",但公司提出出机票钱让他到北京接受培训;他从来没有坐过飞机，于是就同意了。他接受了公开演讲、员工管理和商标注册方面的速成课程。快手急于宣传其健康的新方向，在媒体上宣传了他的旅程。
"Over time, Taiping who at first had kept a Mandarin dictionary just offscreen became confidentand unflappable. He heartily gnawed his jerky on camera. He invited fans, whom he called ""old friends,"" to visit, promising a personal grasslands tour. When he occasionally still stumbled over a word, he poked fun at his limited education.","随着时间的推移，最初还需要在屏幕之外放一本普通话字典的太平变得自信而镇定。他在镜头前大嚼牛肉干。他邀请被他称呼为""老铁""的粉丝们来参观，承诺那将是一场为个人定制的草原之旅。偶尔还为一个词磕磕绊绊时，他就取笑自己读书少。"
"In 2018, he sold $650,000 worth of jerky earning 30 times more that year than two years earlier.",2018年，他卖出了价值450万元的牛肉干，当年的收入是两年前的30倍。
"Then the pandemic hit, turbocharging online shopping. The value of Kuaishou's e-commerce sales grew six times in 2020 over the prior year, according to company statistics, mirroring booms at Douyinand Taobao Live, the other major live shopping platform. In 2021, Kuaishou went public for $5.4 billion, the world's biggest technology initial public offering since Uber.",然后，新冠疫情爆发推动了网上购物。根据快手的统计数据，该公司2020年的电子商务销售额比前一年增长了五倍，与抖音以及另一个主要在线购物平台淘宝直播一样红火。2021年，快手上市，融资54亿美元，成为继优步之后全球最大的科技公司首次公开募股。
"Taiping's business soared, too. He now has 10 customer-service employees who help him respond to fans while he talks. He still sometimes streams from his grassland yurt but also had a yurt backdrop built above his brick-and-mortar store. Onscreen, he wears traditional clothing customers like the feeling of authenticity, he said but off duty, favors Fila athletic suits.",太平的生意也蒸蒸日上。他现在有10名客服人员，在他讲话时帮助他回应粉丝。他有时还会去他的草原蒙古包里直播，但在他的实体店也搭了一个蒙古包布景。在屏幕上，他穿着传统服装——他说顾客喜欢那种地道的感觉——但下班后，他喜欢穿斐乐的运动服。
"""Before, how would I know what a trademark was?"" he said. ""Now I have three.""","""我以前哪知道商标?""他说。""我现在有三个商标。"""
Chasing an Elusive Dream,追逐遥不可及的梦想
"More than 1,000 miles south of Taiping's grassland empire, the city of Yiwu is a living showcasefor how pervasivelivestreaming sales have become.",在太平的草原帝国以南1600多公里处，义乌市生动地展示了直播销售的普及程度。
"The city, a manufacturing hub south of Shanghai, claims China's first college forlivestreaming e-commerce, as well as multiple training academies that offer days- or weeklong courses. Its office towers house dozens of companies dedicated to managing streamers. The city government, to woo high-earning influencers, has promised prime school placement for their children. Officials built a red archway above a street, trumpeting in neon letters: ""Social Media and E-Commerce Capital.""","位于上海以南的制造业中心义乌拥有中国第一所直播电商学院，以及多家提供几天或一周课程的培训学校。那里的写字楼内有数十家致力于管理主播的公司。市政府为了吸引高收入的网红，承诺统筹安排其子女入学。官员们在一条街道上方建造了一个红色拱门，用几个霓虹灯大字大肆宣扬""社交媒体和电子商务之都""。"
"Every day, Yiwu drawsaspiring streamers like Wang Tiebiao, 55, who is from a small city in eastern Shandong Province about 700 miles away. Mr. Wang had been delivering cargo and selling cheap stainless steel cookware, barely covering inventory costs. Then he saw a Douyin video recruiting streamers to sell home goods for a factory in Yiwu, and promising free training.",每天，义乌都会吸引像55岁的王铁标(音)这样满怀抱负的主播，他来自1100多公里外山东省东部的一个小城市。王铁标过去一直做的是货物运输和销售廉价不锈钢炊具，几乎无法负担库存成本。然后他看到一个抖音视频在招募主播为义乌的一家工厂卖家居用品，并承诺免费培训。
"""If you open a physical business, you have to pay rent, buy goods, invest so much,"" Mr. Wang said in February, days after getting to the city. ""For this, you just need yourself and a phone.""","""投资实体店你又要租房，又要进货的，资金多大，""王铁标在2月来到这座城市几天后说。""这个出个人就可以了，然后有个手机就行了。"""
"But the rapid expansion of the field, which has created more opportunities for anybodyto jump in, has also made it more difficult to hang on. If Taiping embodied livestreaming's potential for riches, Yiwu is closer to most people's reality.",这个领域的迅速扩张创造了更多的机会，任何人都可以进入，但也让坚持下去变得更加困难。如果太平体现了直播的致富潜力，义乌更接近大多数人的现实。
"Under Mr. Wang's deal with the factory, he could choose any of its goods to promote on his personalDouyin account. He would receive a commission on any sales. He had no income otherwise.",根据王铁标与工厂的协议，他可以选择工厂的任何商品放在他的个人抖音账户上进行推广。任何销售都能让他获得佣金。没有销售就没有收入。
"To make a sale, however, he had to stand out against legions of other streamers not only the fellow newbies working for the same factory, but also the smooth-talking veterans trained and backed by production companies. From his free training, he learned only a few catchphrases and basic technical skills.",然而，为了卖出东西，他必须在众多其他主播中脱颖而出——不仅是同一家工厂里的那些新手，还有那些由制作公司培训和支持的能说会道的老手。从他的免费培训中，他只学到了一些流行语和基本的操作技能。
"For several days, Mr. Wang wandered around the factory's showroom, assessing what among the rows of plastic bowls and spatulas he could pitch well. One morning, fixing his camera on a decorative hourglass shaped like interlocking gemstones, he tested the techniques he had learned for sweet-talking viewers.",几天来，王铁标在工厂的展示厅里转来转去，看着一排排塑料碗和锅铲，估量着什么好卖。一天早上，他将摄像头对着一个宝石形状的装饰性沙漏，检验自己学到的那些吸引观众的技巧。
"""Fans are the heavens and earth, so hit that follow button,"" he said. His glasses and measured delivery gave him a soothing, professorial air, and he avoided extended silences. Still, his viewers stayed in the single digits.","""粉丝是天，粉丝是地，点个关注，""他说。他的眼镜和有条不紊的讲话让他有一种舒缓的、教授般的气质，他避免长时间的沉默。尽管如此，他的观众仍停留在个位数。"
"""There's some metaphysics, or luck, or secrets that we don't know,"" Mr. Wang said.","""谁知道他这玩意，很多玄学的东西，很多运气的东西，要不就是有很多秘密咱不掌握，""王铁标说。"
Some secrets may be just a matter of money. Many streamers now complain that the apps promote only accounts that pay for traffic. Big agencies splurge on advertising.,有些秘密可能只是钱的问题。许多流媒体现在抱怨说，这些应用程序只推广为流量付费的帐户。大机构在广告上一掷千金。
"Within days of arriving in Yiwu, several of Mr. Wang's fellow trainees had pivoted to looking for more traditional work. Still, Mr. Wang, who had amassed about 1,000 followers, planned to keep trying.","""对于那些没有大量初始资金的人来说，要真正取得成功越来越难，""电子商务学者张琳教授说。""它非常工业化。"""
"""If I were just another cog in a factory, I could make a few thousand dollars, but I don't want that,"" he said. ""Since we all have to work anyway, I'd rather work for something that has a chance of success.""",抵达义乌几天后，王铁标的几位同期实习生就转向了更传统的工作。尽管如此，已经积累了大约1000名粉丝的王铁标仍然打算再试一试。
The State Tries to Clean Up And Control,"""稳稳当当的进厂当螺丝也能挣几千块钱，""他说。""既然都是做事，那么就抱着成功几率大的方向努力。"""
But that success can vanish as quickly as it appears.,政府试图整顿——并控制
"First to disappear was Viya, whose real name is Huang Wei, the livestreaming star who had broadcast with Ms. Kardashian. One day in December 2021, all of her social media accounts were deleted.",但这种成功消失的速度和它的到来一样快。
"Several months later, Li Jiaqi, the lipstick king, was abruptly cut off midstream. He posted on social media that he was fixing a technical glitch then went silent.",最先消失的是本名黄薇的薇娅，一名曾与卡戴珊一起直播过的主播。2021年12月的一天，她的所有社交媒体账户都被删除了。
Both had run afoul of the other major force reshaping the livestreaming market: government scrutiny.,"几个月后，""口红一哥""李佳琦突然中断直播。他在社交媒体上发帖说正在修复一个技术故障——然后就没了消息。"
"Growth was so quick that at first few rules existed to govern it, and soon complaints of misconduct piled up. Brands accused influencers of faking viewership numbers to demand higher commissions. Shoppers reported receiving counterfeit goods from streamers who had seemed trustworthy. Beijing had little way of knowing just how much streamers were earning.",两个人都与重塑直播市场的另一主要力量发生了冲突:政府审查。
"And as audiences grew, so did the potential for livestreams to promote ideas beyond what to buy in a format that was, by definition, unpredictable, posing political concerns for a government fixated on control.",这个领域增长非常迅速，以至于起初几乎没有什么规则来监管它，人们对不当行为的投诉很快堆积如山。品牌指责网红伪造观看量以索取更高的佣金。消费者举报说，他们从看上去可靠的主播那里买到了假货。北京几乎无法知道主播的收入有多少。
"Starting in late 2020, regulators began playing catch-up, issuing increasingly detailed restrictions on what streamers could say and do part of a broader crackdown on the tech sector, whichBeijing believed had grown too influential.",随着观众数量的增长，直播对于购物之外的东西也越来越有推广潜力——这种形式从一开始就是不可预测的，会给一门心思要控制的政府带来政治担忧。
"Many of the regulations aim to protect consumers. Unproven claims that products can promote weight loss or improve feng shuiare forbidden. Platforms often ban the use of superlatives, like ""cheapest"" or ""best."" The rules are enforced through a mix of human censors and artificial intelligence; penalties range from 10-minute suspensions to permanent bans.",从2020年底开始，监管机构开始跟进，对主播的言行做出越来越详细的限制——这是对科技行业更广泛打击的一部分，北京认为科技行业的影响力已经过大。
"Viya'soffensewas evading more than $100 million in taxes, according to the authorities. Theyfined her$210 million, then apparently erased her from the internet. More than a year later, she has not resurfaced.","许多法规旨在保护消费者。宣称产品有助于减肥或改善风水等未经证实的说法被禁止。平台通常禁止使用""最""字，例如""最便宜""或""最好""。这些规则是结合了人工审查员和AI来执行的;处罚范围从停播10分钟到永久禁播。"
"But the governmentalso wants live-streamers to abide by its moral and political standards. Platforms have banned smoking and low necklines. A state-issuedcode of conduct, issued in June, ordered hosts not to disparage the Chinese Communist Party, and to""establish a correct world outlook.""",据当局称，薇娅的罪行是逃税超过1亿美元。他们对她处以2.1亿美元的罚款，然后似乎将她从互联网上抹去了。一年多后，她还是没有再露面。
"""To be a live-streamer, you must have reverence,"" a commentary in People's Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, said. ""You absolutely must not cross the bottom line for the sake of traffic, or test the law for the sake of money.""","但政府还希望直播者遵守其道德和政治标准。平台已经禁止吸烟和低胸装束。6月，国家发布了行为准则，要求主播不得贬低中国共产党，并""树立正确的世界观""。"
"As the rules proliferated, they risked eroding the central appeal of live-streamed shopping: the entertaining, carnivalesque atmosphere. Mr. Li, the star streamer, had drawn an ardent following with his sassy, at-times off-color jokes, poking fun at other celebrities. But as regulations emerged, he said, he restrained his style. In an interview with a Chinese news outlet in 2021, heacknowledged that some fans thought he had become boring; sometimes, he said, heagreed.","""当网络主播，必须得有敬畏之心，""共产党喉舌《人民日报》去年夏天的一篇评论说。""绝不能为了流量突破底线，为了赚钱挑战法律、频打擦边球。"""
"But Mr. Li could not avoid all risks. In the livestream last year where he was cut off midstream, he pitched hisviewers on a tank-shaped ice cream cake one day beforethe anniversary of the Chinese military's June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators. There is no indication that Mr. Li intended to deliver a politically charged message. The topic is heavily censored in China and many younger people do not know about it. Still, he vanished for three months.",越来越多的规则可能会侵蚀直播购物的核心吸引力:娱乐、狂欢的气氛。明星主播李佳琦以其泼辣、时而粗俗的笑话，以及与其他名人逗乐的行为吸引了一群狂热追随者。但他说，随着法规的出现，他克制了自己的风格。在2021年接受一家中国新闻媒体采访时，他承认一些粉丝认为他变得无聊;他说，有时他也这么觉得。
"The constantly evolving landscape has also weighed on smaller-time streamers, like Taiping.","但李佳琦也无法规避所有风险。去年，他直播被切断是因为向观众推销了一块坦克形状的冰淇淋蛋糕，而那正值""六四""纪念日的前一天——1989年6月4日，中国军队对天安门的民主示威者进行了血腥镇压。没有迹象表明李佳琦想要借此传递带有政治色彩的信息。关于""六四""的话题在中国受到严格审查，许多年轻人都不知道这件事。尽管如此，他还是消失了三个月。"
"Viewers frequently ask him to speak in Mongolian, and he used to readily comply. But then the streaming platforms started issuing automated warnings for speaking in languages other than Mandarin. (The government has made Mandarin usage a key part of assimilationist policies; other languages may also be harder for censors to understand.)",变幻无常的格局也让太平这样的小众主播感到了压力。
"Taiping now at most says hello in Mongolian. ""I won't talk at random,"" he said. ""I've seen what happened to others, and I warn myself.""",经常有观众要他说蒙古语，他过去总会欣然应允。但后来直播平台开始对汉语以外的语言发出自动警告。(讲汉语是政府民族同化政策的关键;其他语言也会让审查人员更难理解。)
"In recent months, the pace of new regulations has slowed, as the government has pledged to rejuvenate the economy, including by supporting tech companies. Government reports have called livestreaming e-commerce an important channel for boosting consumption.","如今太平顶多用蒙古语跟观众打招呼。""我不乱说话，""他说。""我就看到别人的东西，警告自己。"""
Tech companies still see room for expansion. Douyin last year reported 124 percent annual growth in livestreaming sales.,近几个月来，随着政府承诺重振经济——这包括支持科技企业——监管新规的出台有所放缓。政府报告将电商直播称为促进消费的重要渠道。
"In the United States, YouTube and Amazon have poured money into it. But it has struggled to catch on. Americans have returned to in-personshopping after the pandemic, and unlike in China, Western social media apps don't have as many built-in payment features. Facebook and Instagram recently abandoned live shopping.",科技企业仍看到了扩张的空间。抖音去年公布的直播销售额年增长124%。
"Even in China, the future of the business is far from certain.",在美国，YouTube和亚马逊已经在大举投资电商直播。但它很难发展出中国的规模。疫情后，美国人恢复了实体购物的习惯，而西方社交媒体应用程序并未设置那么多内置支付功能，这也与中国不同。Facebook和Instagram最近都放弃了直播购物。
"Taiping, despite his success, doesn't see himself streaming forever. Spending hours every day performing for the camera is exhausting; once the stream turns off, he often doesn't want to talk.",但即便在中国，该行业的未来也充满了不确定性。
"He dreams of moving to a big city, becoming amore traditional businessman.",尽管太平取得了成功，但他不认为自己会永远播下去。每天在镜头前表演那么久令他精疲力尽;只要下播，他往往就失去了说话的欲望。
"Once, he imagined passing his account to his preteen daughter, but no longer. ""By then, who knows if e-commerce will still be around?"" he said. ""There will probably be something new.""",他梦想在大城市安家，做一个更传统的商人。
"Li You, Joy Dongand Liu Yi contributed research.","他曾幻想过让未成年的女儿以后继承自己的账号，但最终打消了这个念头。""到她的时候电商不一定有了，""他说。""也得出来一波新的东西。"""
"In the latest official scrutiny of a prominent American business in China, the authorities visited the Shanghai offices of the U.S. management consulting firm Bain & Company this month to question its employees.",中国的有关部门本月来到美国管理咨询公司贝恩公司(Bain & Company)上海分公司，对员工进行问话，这是最新一起知名美国企业在中国受到官方盘问的事件。
"In a written statement, Bain said it is ""cooperating as appropriate with the Chinese authorities,"" but declined to comment on the nature of the investigation and whether its employees' phones and computers had been seized during the visit.","贝恩在一份书面声明中表示，它正在""与中国有关部门进行必要的合作""，但拒绝就调查的性质以及员工的手机和电脑在搜查时是否遭到没收发表评论。"
"The questioning at Bain came less than a month after the authorities detained five Chinese nationals working in Beijing for the Mintz Group, an American consulting company with 18 offices around the world, and closed the branch. The five Chinese nationals were held overnight before their families were notified that they had been detained. China's foreign ministry later said that the company was suspected of engaging in unlawful business operations.",在对贝恩公司员工进行问话不到一个月前，当局拘留了在北京为美思明智集团(Mintz Group)工作的五名中国公民，并关闭了该办事处，这家美国咨询公司在全球设有18个办事处。这五名中国公民在被拘留一夜后，他们的家人才接到通知。中国外交部随后表示，该公司涉嫌非法经营。
Mintz had no immediate response on Thursday to a request for comment on whether any of its five employees had been released.,周四，美思明智没有立即回应关于其五名员工是否已获释的置评请求。
"Companies that buy or invest in a factory or another company typically hire a business like Mintz to do what is known as a due diligence review, checking to make sure there are no hidden problems involving the target company. Bain, by contrast, provides corporate advice: Companies share details of their sales, operations and long-term plans with Bain to obtain an independent perspective on how they can improve.",企业在购买或投资一家工厂或另一家公司时，通常会聘请像美思明智这样的公司进行所谓的尽职调查，确保没有涉及收购企业的隐藏问题。与美思明智不同，贝恩做企业咨询:企业与贝恩分享销售、运营和长期计划的细节，以获得关于如何改进的独立意见。
"The raid on Bain's operations in Shanghai is the latest sign of the strained economic relationship between the U.S. and China. Beijing is especially upset about restrictions imposed by the Biden administration preventing the sale of critical semiconductor-making equipment to China. Without critical chip-making tools, China's semiconductor industry, already considered a technological laggard, will struggle to close the gap on leading firms and gain access to cutting-edge technologies used in everything from military equipment to consumer electronics.",对贝恩上海分公司的突袭是中美经济关系陷入紧张的最新迹象。拜登政府施加了限制措施，阻止向中国出售关键的半导体制造设备，这令北京尤为不安。中国半导体行业已经被认为技术落后，如果没有关键的芯片制造工具，将难以缩小与领先企业的差距，并难以获得用于从军事设备到消费电子产品等各个领域的尖端技术。
"Beijing is also unhappy that U.S. law enforcement authorities have arrested two men in New York City, accusing them of helping to run an unauthorized Chinese police outpost to intimidate and control Chinese citizens. American prosecutors also filed charges against 42 Chinese police officers and other officials, accusing them of various actions against dissidents in the United States. The Ministry of Public Security accused U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday of having ""maliciously concocted"" and ""completely fabricated"" the charges.","北京还对美国的执法部门感到不满。美国执法当局在纽约市逮捕了两名男子，指控他们帮助管理一个未经批准的中国警察站，用于恐吓和控制中国公民。美国检察官还指控42名中国警察和其他官员在美国对异见人士采取各种行动。周三，公安部指责美国检察官的指控是""恶意炮制""、""完全是无中生有""。"
"""If the U.S. continues to go its own way, China will resolutely counter it to the end,"" the ministry said.","""如美方继续一意孤行，中方必将坚决反制到底，""公安部表示。"
"Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen called for a constructive and healthy economic relationship between the two countries in an address last week that seemed aimed at lowering the temperature in the trans-Pacific relationship. She specifically said the U.S. does not need to ""decouple"" its economy from China and that Chinese growth does not have to come at the expense of U.S. economic leadership.","财政部长耶伦上周在一次讲话中呼吁两国建立建设性和健康的经济关系，这似乎是为了这一跨太平洋关系降温。她特别指出，美国不需要与中国经济""脱钩""，中国的增长也不必以牺牲美国的经济领导地位为代价。"
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai declined to comment on the questioning of Bain employees.,美国驻北京大使馆和上海美国商会拒绝就贝恩员工受到问话一事置评。
"China's targeting of advisory firms comes as the country's top legislative body approved a revised espionage law that broadens the list of activities that would constitute spying. The amended counterespionage law, passed on Wednesday, has alarmed foreign businesses because normal business activities could expose executives and employees at foreign firms to be marked as a spy.",中国将咨询公司作为目标之际，它的最高立法机构批准了反间谍法修订案，扩大了间谍活动的构成范围。周三通过的修订案令外国企业感到担忧，因为正常的商业活动可能会使外国公司的高管和员工被列为间谍。
It is a common business practice for companies to investigate local markets and do background research on potential partners or competitors before investing money. They often rely on advisory firms like Mintz and Bain to help with that work.,公司在投资之前对当地市场进行调查，并对未来的合作伙伴或竞争对手做背景研究，是一种常见的商业惯例。它们通常依靠美思明智和贝恩这样的咨询公司来帮助完成这项工作。
"China's scrutiny of prominent U.S. firms is sending a mixed message after China's economic policymakers had pushed last month for more foreign investment. The foreign business community has grown concerned that the economic pragmatism that helped to build the world's second-largest economy has taken a back seat to the ideological and national security priorities of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping.",上个月，中国的经济决策者还在推动更多外国投资，而现在对知名美国公司的审查发出了一个含混不清的信息。外国商界越来越担心，曾经帮助建立世界第二大经济体的经济实用主义已经让位于中共及其领导人习近平的优先事项，即意识形态和国家安全。
"Foreign companies were especially thrown by China's draconian ""zero-Covid"" policies over the past three years that frequently disrupted businesses, brought economic growth nearly to a halt, and prevented overseas executives from visiting employees and operations in the country.","过去三年，中国严苛的新冠""清零""政策令外国公司尤为担忧，这些政策经常扰乱业务，使经济增长几近停滞，并使海外高管难以前往中国查看员工和业务情况。"
"Li Qiang, China's premier, told a forum of foreign business leaders last month that the country strives to create a business environment ""that is market oriented, ruled by law and internationalized."" It will continue to open up the economy, he said, ""no matter how the international situation changes,"" according to state-owned CCTV News.","中国总理李强上个月在一次外国商界领袖论坛上表示，中国着力打造""市场化、法治化、国际化""的营商环境。据官方的央视新闻报道，他说，""无论国际形势如何变化""，中国将继续开放经济。"
It is not clear whether Beijing is targeting the actual consulting firms or the prominent clients that they advise in China's hard-to-navigate business environment.,这些咨询公司在中国难以驾驭的商业环境中为客户提供咨询建议，目前尚不清楚北京针对的是咨询公司本身还是它们的知名客户。
"The Financial Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the situation, that Chinese police had raided Bain's offices on multiple occasions, removing computers and phones but not detaining employees.",《金融时报》早些时候援引知情人士的话报道，中国警方多次突击搜查贝恩的办公室，没收电脑和手机，但没有拘留员工。
Police raids in China on American advisory firms raise difficult legal dilemmas for the firms. The Chinese government sometimes imposes gag orders in connection with raids.,中国对美国咨询公司的警方突击检查给这些公司带来了艰难的法律困境。中国政府有时会针对突击搜查发出禁言令。
Multinationals typically share sensitive information with advisory firms under confidentiality agreements that require the clients to be notified if any of their data is compromised. So firms that are raided face conflicting legal obligations to the Chinese government and to their clients.,跨国公司通常根据保密协议与咨询公司共享敏感信息，这些协议要求当客户数据泄露时通知客户。因此，遭到搜查的公司面临着对中国政府及其客户在法律义务上的冲突。
Many global companies operating in China are trying to wall off their computer systems outside of China to limit potential losses of trade secrets and other valuable data.,许多在中国经营的跨国公司正试图隔离在中国境外的计算机系统，以限制损失商业机密和其他有价值数据的可能性。
"For years, Xi Jinping, China's leader, has railed against greed and corruption in the country's financial sector, making an example of a few prominent figures along the way.",多年来，中国领导人习近平一直在抨击国内资本行业的贪婪和腐败，并树立了几个典型。
"But recently, the anti-graft campaign has kicked into overdrive, sweeping up a who's who from the country's financial and insurance sector as Mr. Xi and the Chinese Communist Party seek to consolidate control over a critical facet of the economy.",但最近，随着习近平和中共寻求巩固对这一关键经济领域的控制，金融反腐运动进入了高潮，银行和保险行业的众多名人卷入其中。
"China's anti-corruption officials warned bankers in February that it would ""investigate and deal with the people who neglect the party's leadership."" They directed the finance executives to embrace the party's values and avoid emulating what they see as the West's singular focus on money.","中国负责反腐败的官员曾在今年2月警告银行家，将""严肃查处罔顾党对金融工作""领导的人。他们要求金融行业的主管们接受党的价值观，不要效仿其所谓的西方""唯金钱论""。"
"In addition to the discipline campaign, China has carried out sweeping reforms of its financial regulatory system, while deeply embedding party officials into state-owned financial institutions.",除了加强纪律，中国还对国内的金融监管系统进行了全面改革，并向国有金融机构派驻纪检监察组。
"Mr. Xi and his deputies are using the disciplinary cases to force party loyalty on the financial system, said Wu Qiang, a current affairs writer and a political analyst in Beijing.",习近平及其副手们正在利用反腐案件迫使金融系统保持对党的忠诚，北京的时事作家兼政治分析师吴强说道。
"""They can only do it through the control of personnel changes, and run the party's leadership through it,"" Mr. Wu said.","""只能说是人事上的控制，并且把党性贯穿于其中，""吴强说。"
"The lengths to which the government would go to knock down prominent business figures became apparent in 2017 when the police snatched Xiao Jianhua, a China-born billionaire known for managing assets for the country's ruling elite, from his apartment at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison last year.",2017年的肖建华案凸显了政府打击金融行业要人的力度。中国出生的亿万富翁肖建华曾因替中国统治精英们管理资产闻名，他从他长期居住的香港四季酒店的公寓里被警方抓走。去年，他被判处13年有期徒刑。
"The party later stepped in to effectively stop Jack Ma, co-founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, from going forward with what would have been a blockbuster stock offering of Ant Financial in 2020. Ant, the financial sister company of Alibaba, scrapped its plans and Mr. Ma this year agreed to give up control of Ant.",后来，中共还出面叫停了电子商务巨头阿里巴巴联合创始人马云的蚂蚁金服上市计划，它本来有望成为2020年引发轰动的首次股票发行。阿里巴巴的金融姊妹公司蚂蚁金服取消了上市计划，马云已在今年同意放弃对蚂蚁金服的控制股权。
"In 2022, Chinese regulators said they punished banking and insurance institutions 4,620 times, a 19 percent increase from a year earlier, while issuing 7,561 penalties to officials, up 26 percent.",中国监管机构称，他们在2022全年处罚银行保险机构4620家，比上一年高出19%，同时处罚责任人员7561人次，比加上一年高出26%。
"""Disciplining finance is a potent way to keep elites in check,"" said Yuen Yuen Ang, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University.","""加强金融行业的纪律是控制精英的有效方式，""约翰霍普金斯大学政治经济学教授洪源远说。"
"Since the start of this year, dozens of Chinese executives and senior officials in the country's financial sector have been put under investigation or sanctioned, according to the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the country's top anti-corruption watchdog, and the National Supervisory Commission, the government regulator that works in concert with the discipline commission.",来自中共中央纪律检查委员会(中国最高反腐监督机构)以及国家监察委员会(它与纪检委协同工作)的信息显示，自今年年初以来，已有数十名中国金融业高管和高级官员被调查或受处分。
Here are some of the prominent figures and firms that have been caught up in the dragnet this year.,以下是今年身陷法网的一些知名人士和公司。

"Huang Xianhui, the former party secretary and general manager of Beijing Branch of China Huarong Asset Management, is under investigation for suspicion of duty-related violations of law.",中国华融资产管理公司北京分公司原党委书记、总经理黄宪辉涉嫌职务犯罪正在接受调查。
"Huarong Asset Management, a so-called bad debt firm established in 1999, is one of four major state-owned companies set up after the Asia financial crisis to take over loans and other assets that had plunged in value.",华融资产管理公司是一家成立于1999年的所谓坏账公司，是政府在亚洲金融危机后为接管价值暴跌的贷款和其他资产成立的四大国有企业之一。
"In January 2021, Lai Xiaomin, the former chairman of Huarong, was sentenced to death on charges of bribery, corruption and bigamy after taking some $277 million in bribes. He was executed several weeks later in a rare use in China of capital punishment for economic crimes.",2021年1月，中国华融原董事长赖小民被判处死刑，他被指控收受贿赂折合人民币约17.88亿余元，犯有受贿、贪污和重婚等罪。他在数周后被处决。中国极少对经济犯罪做出死刑判决。

"Liu Liange, Bank of China",中国银行刘连舸
"Liu Liange, former party secretary and president of the Bank of China, is under investigation by the country's top anti-corruption watchdogs.",中国银行原党委书记、行长刘连舸正在接受中国最高反腐机构的调查。
"Mr. Liu was removed as the party secretary of the bank in February and a month later resigned as president and other roles. The Bank of China, a state-owned commercial lender, is the focus of claims of misappropriation of funds, the improper classification of the risks of certain loans and other alleged offenses.",刘连舸已在今年2月被免去中国银行党委书记的职务，一个月后，他辞去了行长和其他职务。中国银行是一家国有商业银行，它处于政府对挪用资金、某些贷款风险分类不当，以及其他涉嫌违法行为进行调查的焦点。
"On the same day Mr. Liu was removed as party secretary of the bank, regulators disclosed that the bank had been fined, along with four other financial institutions, for similar violations.",就在刘连舸被免去中国银行党委书记职务的同一天，监管机构透露，该行和其他四家金融机构已因上述违规行为被罚款。

"In February, Chinese prosecutors filed a case against Mr. Tian, accusing him of bribery, insider trading and leaking insider information. The prosecution also accused Mr. Tian of ""abusing power for personal gain that caused particularly heavy losses to national interests.""","今年2月，中国的检察官对田惠宇提起诉讼，指控他受贿、内幕交易和泄露内幕信息。检方还指控田惠宇""徇私舞弊、滥用职权，致使国家利益遭受特别重大损失""。"
"Wang Liang, president of China Merchants Bank, said in October 2022 that ""Tian Huiyu's case is only a personal incident and has no direct relationship with CMB.""","招商银行行长王良在2022年10月表示，""田惠宇案件是他个人的事件，与招商银行没有直接的关系。"""

January,1月
"Zhou Gaoxiong, Guangdong Rural Credit Union",广东省农村信用社联合社周高雄
"Zhou Gaoxiong, the former party secretary and chairman of the Guangdong Rural Credit Union, was expelled from the party in January after being accused of serious duty violations and suspected bribery crimes. Mr. Zhou, who had retired three years earlier, was also forced to give up his pension benefits.",广东省农村信用社联合社原党委书记、理事长周高雄被指控以权谋私、涉嫌受贿等罪名，已在今年1月被开除党籍。已在三年前退休的周高雄还被取消了相应退休待遇。
"The move continued a crackdown on China's rural banks after a scandal in Henan Province last year when rural banks refused to let depositors withdraw their money, causing waves of protests.",这是中国整治村镇银行的继续。河南去年曾发生村镇银行拒绝让储户取款的丑闻，引发了抗议浪潮。
The authorities started the investigation of Mr. Zhou for alleged violations of discipline and law last November.,去年11月，当局以涉嫌违纪违法的罪名对周高雄进行调查。
"China's internet censorship is well known, but a report has quantified the extent of it, uncovering more than 66,000 rules controlling the content that is available to people using search engines.",中国的互联网审查众所周知，但一份报告量化了审查的程度，发现了超过6.6万条规则控制着人们通过搜索引擎获得的内容。
"The most diligent censor, by at least one measure, is Microsoft's search engine Bing, the only foreign search engine operating in the country, according to the report, which was released on Wednesday by the Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity research group at the University of Toronto.","根据多伦多大学网络安全研究小组""公民实验室""周三发布的报告，至少从一项衡量标准来看，审查最认真的是微软的搜索引擎必应，这是在该国运营的唯一一个外国搜索引擎。"
"The findings suggested that China's censorship apparatus had become not only more pervasive, but also more subtle. The search engines, including Bing, have created algorithms to ""hard censor"" searches deemed to be politically sensitive by providing no results or by limiting the results to selected sources, which are usually government agencies or state news organizations that follow the Communist Party's line.","报告表明，中国的审查机制不仅变得更加普遍，而且更加隐蔽。包括必应在内的搜索引擎已经创建了算法来""硬审查""被认为具有政治敏感性的搜索，不提供搜索结果或将结果限制在选定的来源，这些来源通常是遵循共产党路线的政府机构或国家新闻机构。"
"""You might get no results if it is a very sensitive topic, but if your query is subject to this kind of self-censorship, what happens is you actually appear to get results as normal, but that's not actually happening,"" said Jeffrey Knockel, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab and an author of the report. ""You're getting results only from certain pre-authorized websites.""","""如果是非常敏感的话题，你可能得不到任何结果，但如果你的搜索受到这种自我审查，那么你看上去像是得到了正常的结果，但实际上并不是这样，""公民实验室高级研究员、报告作者杰弗里·诺克尔说。""你获得的结果仅来自一些事先批准的网站。"""
"The organization's researchers studied eight online platforms that offer search tools: the search engines Baidu, Sogou and Bing; the social media sites Weibo, Douyin, Bilibili and Baidu Zhidao; and the e-commerce giant Jingdong.",该组织的研究人员研究了八个提供搜索工具的网络平台:搜索引擎百度、搜狗和必应;社交媒体网站微博、抖音、哔哩哔哩和百度知道;还有电商巨头京东。
"All are subject to extensive legal restrictions that have long censored criminal activity, obscenity, pornography, violence and gore, in addition to virtually any political, ethnic or religious content viewed as threatening to Communist Party rule and social stability.",所有这些平台都受到广泛的法律限制，长期审查犯罪活动、淫秽、色情、暴力和血腥内容，此外还有几乎所有被视为威胁共产党统治和社会稳定的政治、种族或宗教内容。
"More recent restrictions have extended to defamation of the country's heroes or martyrs, illegal surrogacy and misleading or false information about Covid-19 in Beijing.",最近还扩展到限制诽谤国家英雄或烈士、非法代孕以及有关北京新冠疫情的误导性或虚假信息。
Each of the companies have created mechanisms to comply with the government's ever-evolving restrictions.,每家公司都建立了机制来遵守政府不断变化的限制。
"The report found that Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, restricted search results for the term ""Chinese spy balloon"" so that only information from official Chinese sources would appear to those seeking to learn about the surveillance airship shot down by the United States in February.","报告发现，微博对""中国间谍气球""的搜索结果加以限制，这样一来，寻求了解美国2月击落侦查气球事件的人只会看到来自中国官方信源的信息。"
"Baidu blocked all results for searches that included the country's leader, Xi Jinping, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the international warrant for the Russian president's arrest issued days ahead of Mr. Xi's visit to Moscow in March.",百度曾屏蔽所有关于以下内容的搜索结果:中国领导人习近平、俄罗斯总统普京以及在习近平3月访问莫斯科前几天发布的对俄罗斯总统的国际逮捕令。
"The report said that the Chinese tech companies had adopted more rules than Bing, one of the few foreign tech platforms allowed in the country, but compared with Baidu, Bing's rules were broader and affected more search results. They also on average restricted results from more domains.",报告称，中国科技公司采用的规则比必应更多，必应是中国允许的为数不多的外国科技平台之一。但与百度相比，必应的规则范围更广，影响的搜索结果也更多。一般来说，他们还限制来自更多域名的结果。
"Caitlin Roulston, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said the company would look into the findings but had not yet fully analyzed them. ""We are reaching out to Citizens Lab directly to get more information so that we can conduct any further investigation needed,"" she said.","微软发言人凯特琳·罗尔斯顿表示，公司将就报告的发现做出调研，但尚未对其进行全面分析。""我们正在直接联系公民实验室以获取更多信息，以便我们可以进行必要的进一步调查，""她说。"
"Microsoft is one of the few foreign technology companies that still operates inside China, and it has acknowledged that to do so required complying with the country's censorship laws, something other companies, most prominently Google, refused to do.",微软是少数仍在中国运营的外国科技公司之一，它承认在中国运营需要遵守中国的审查法，另一些公司——尤其是谷歌——拒绝这样做。
"Conditions in China have often been fraught for Microsoft, with the company's products facing crackdowns from the authorities. In 2019, Bing itself was blocked temporarily. In 2021, Microsoft shut down LinkedIn in China after seven years in the country, citing regulatory and competitive obstacles.",微软在中国的处境常常令人担忧，该公司的产品面临当局的打击。2019年，必应本身被短暂屏蔽。2021年，微软以监管和竞争障碍为由，在LinkedIn进入中国7年后关闭在该国的业务。
"Mr. Knockel said the study reinforced the argument that foreign tech companies could do little to restrict censorship or other demands from the government. China, for example, has signaled that it will restrict the operations of artificial intelligence in chat bots, which Microsoft has already unveiled for Bing.",诺克尔说，这项研究强化了这样一种论点，即外国科技公司在限制审查制度或政府的其他要求方面无能为力。例如，中国已表示将限制人工智能在聊天机器人中的运用，微软已经为必应推出了这样的聊天机器人。
"""Just simply allowing American tech companies to do business in China isn't going to solve any of the censorship or larger human rights issues that we would like to be solved in China,"" Mr. Knockel said.","""仅仅使美国科技公司能够在中国开展业务，并不能解决我们希望在中国解决的任何审查制度问题或更大的人权问题，""诺克尔说。"
"BEIJING China said on Tuesday that it would no longer require travelers entering the country to show a negative P.C.R. test for the coronavirus, another step toward reopening after a long period of pandemic-era isolation.",北京——中国周二表示，将不再要求入境旅客出示新冠病毒核酸检测阴性证明。在经历了大流行时期的长时间与世隔绝后，它向重新开放又迈出了一步。
"But it was not clear whether testing requirements would be abolished altogether. A spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry said only that, beginning on April 29, people going to China ""can"" take an antigen test to ""replace"" the previously mandated P.C.R. test within 48 hours before boarding their flight.","但目前尚不清楚是否会彻底取消检测要求。中国外交部发言人只是表示，从4月29日起，前往中国的旅客""可以""用登机前48小时内的抗原检测""替代""以前必须的核酸检测。"
"Airlines would not check test results before boarding, the spokeswoman, Mao Ning, added at a regularly scheduled news briefing. She did not say whether others, such as immigration officials, would check.",发言人毛宁在例行记者会上还表示，航空公司不再在登机前查验检测结果。她没有说其他人，比如移民官员是否会查验。
"Notices by Chinese embassies overseas said that travelers arriving in China would still need to fill out a health declaration form, and that customs officials would conduct unspecified spot checks.",中国驻外大使馆的通知称，抵达中国的旅客仍需填写健康申报表，海关将按一定比例进行抽样检测。
"For three years, China imposed the world's strictest coronavirus restrictions, implementing lockdowns and regular mass testing in the name of ""zero Covid."" Then, the government abruptly abandoned those rules in December as the economy sagged, the virus spread widely and protests broke out across the country. Beijing has since declared that it is open to the world, and tried to woo foreign businesspeople and diplomats.","中国在三年里实施了世界上最严格的新冠病毒防控措施，以""新冠清零""的名义实施大规模封控和经常性的全员核酸检测。后来，随着经济萎靡不振、病毒广泛传播，以及全国各地爆发抗议活动，政府在去年12月突然放弃了这项政策。之后，北京宣布重新开放国门，试图吸引外国商人和外交官来华。"
"In practice, the reopening has been slowed, in part, by geopolitical tensions. Tourist visas were not reinstated until last month. International flights remain prohibitively expensive for many, often costing thousands of dollars. The United States and China have not yet lifted tit-for-tat caps that they imposed on routes between their two countries during the pandemic.",实际上，重新开放的速度一直比较慢，部分原因是地缘政治紧张局势。中国政府直到上个月才恢复签发旅游签证。国际航班机票对许多人来说仍非常贵，动辄数千美元。美国和中国尚未取消大流行期间对往来航班施加的针锋相对的限制措施。
"Testing requirements also became politicized. In January, as the coronavirus spread widely across China, several countries, including the United States, Japan and South Korea, announced mandatory tests for inbound travelers from China. China, in response, doubled down on its requirement for travelers from those countries and also suspended the issuance of some visas for Japanese and South Koreans. (South Korea had also suspended some visas for Chinese travelers.)",检测要求也变得政治化。今年1月，随着新冠病毒在中国广泛传播，包括美国、日本和韩国在内的多个国家宣布要求来自中国的旅客在入境时必须出示核酸阴性证明。作为回应，中国加强了对来自这些国家的入境旅客的要求，并暂停向日本人和韩国人发放某些类别的签证。(韩国也暂停了向中国旅行者发放某些签证。)
"The United States, Japan and South Korea no longer require any pre-departure tests for travelers arriving from China, but China had not changed its rule until Tuesday.",美国、日本、韩国已不再要求来自中国的旅客在出发前做任何检测，但中国直到周二才改变了本国的规定。
"Travelers from other countries to China, meanwhile, had been allowed to take antigen tests.",中国在此前已允许从其他国家到中国旅行的人只做抗原检测。
"One day before the rule change was announced, Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, had called for the abolition of the P.C.R. test requirement, noting that it was costly and time-consuming for many travelers, and was motivated by a ""predominance of geopolitical considerations.""","在中国宣布此消息的前一天，外交关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠曾呼吁中国政府废除核酸检测要求，他指出，该要求对许多旅行者来说既费钱又费时，而且其动机""由地缘政治考虑主导""。"
"The rule ""cannot be justified on public health grounds, and it is alienating the Chinese diaspora overseas, impeding China's tourism industry, and hindering China's post-Covid reopening efforts,"" Mr. Huang wrote in a blog post on the New York-based council's website.","该委员会的总部设在纽约，黄严忠在委员会网站上发布的一篇博文中写道，登机前出示核酸检测证明的规定""不能以公共卫生为理由证明合理，它疏远了海外华人侨民，阻碍了中国的旅游业，妨碍了中国在新冠疫情后重新开放的努力""。"
"China has insisted all along that its Covid measures were purely driven by science. In her announcement, Ms. Mao, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, said China would ""continue to scientifically optimize"" its rules.","中国一直坚称其新冠病毒防控措施完全是基于科学。外交部发言人毛宁在记者会上称，中国将继续""科学优化防控政策""。"
"BEIJING A high-ranking editor at a Chinese Communist Party newspaper who often wrote liberal-leaning commentaries is expected to stand trial for espionage in Beijing, after he was arrested while eating lunch with a Japanese diplomat.",北京——一名经常撰写自由主义倾向评论文章的中共党报高级编辑预计将在北京以间谍罪受审，此前，他在与一名日本外交官共进午餐时被捕。
"The editor, Dong Yuyu, was a columnist and deputy editor of the editorial section at Guangming Daily, one of the party's major newspapers. For decades, he had routinely met with foreigners, including diplomats and journalists, in part to inform his own prolific writing. But now the authorities are eyeing those interactions as proof that he was working as a foreign agent, potentially for Japan or the United States, according to Mr. Dong's family.",编辑董郁玉是《光明日报》评论部副主任和专栏作家，该报是中共党报之一。几十年来，勤于笔耕的董郁玉与包括外交官和记者在内的外国人士保持着频繁的往来，这在一定程度上是为了写作需要。但据董郁玉的家人说，现在当局正在将这些往来视为证据，认为他可能是日本或美国的间谍。
"In the decade since China's top leader, Xi Jinping, took power, he has encouraged and at times outright exhorted suspicion of foreign and especially Western countries, which he has cast as bent on undermining China. At the same time, he has virtually eliminated the space for liberal views like Mr. Dong's in part by depicting them as another symptom of foreign meddling.",自上台后的十年里，中国最高领导人习近平一直在鼓励、有时甚至公然宣扬对外国尤其是西方国家的怀疑，他认为这些国家一心要破坏中国。与此同时，他几乎抹杀了像董郁玉这样的自由主义观点的空间——在某种程度上将这些观点称之为外国干涉的又一表现。
"The relatively liberal Chinese publications where Mr. Dong once published, in addition to writing for his own employer, have been gutted. Chinese journalists have been barred from writing for overseas publications; previously, Mr. Dong had contributed several articles to The New York Times's Chinese website.",除了为自己的单位写稿外，董郁玉还给相对自由的中文出版物撰稿，现在它们都已遭封杀。中国记者已被禁止为海外出版物撰稿;此前，董郁玉曾多次为纽约时报中文网供稿。
"It is not clear whether Mr. Dong, 61, was targeted for his liberal views, his contacts with foreigners or both, according to his family members, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. They said the only evidence presented thus far has been his contacts with foreign diplomats and overseas academic fellowships he received.",据他的家人说，目前尚不清楚61岁的董郁玉之所以成为目标，是因为他的自由主义观点还是他与外国人的接触，或两者兼而有之。由于害怕遭到报复，他们要求匿名。他们说，迄今为止提供的唯一证据是他与外国外交官的联系，以及他获得的海外学术奖学金。
"""His foreign ties were not suspicious but a normal part of his job and a normal interaction between peoples in most parts of the world,"" the family said in a statement. ""The message seems to be that foreign contacts are taboo.""","""他的外国关系没有疑点，不过是他正常工作的一部分，是世界多数地区人与人之间的正常交往，""他的家人在一份声明中说。""这里所传达的信息似乎是，与外国接触是禁忌。"""
"Mr. Dong was detained on Feb. 21 last year, while meeting a Japanese diplomat at a hotel restaurant in central Beijing. The diplomat was also detained an incident that prompted protests from the Japanese government, which accused China of violating international standards on diplomatic immunity. China said, without providing evidence, that the diplomat had been engaged in activities ""inconsistent"" with his work.","去年2月21日，董郁玉在北京市中心一家酒店的餐厅跟一名日本外交官碰面时被捕。这名外交官也被拘留——事件引发了日本政府的抗议，指责中国违反了外交豁免权的国际准则。中国在未提供证据的情况下表示，这名外交官从事了与他的工作""不符""的活动。"
"The diplomat was released after several hours. Mr. Dong, however, was held for six months in a murky form of secret detention, then formally arrested. Last month, he was indicted.",几小时后，这名外交官获释。然而，董郁玉被不明不白地秘密关押了六个月，然后被正式逮捕。上个月，他遭到了起诉。
"It is not clear when he will stand trial. Charges related to national security are shrouded in secrecy, with trials held behind closed doors. Espionage can carry a prison sentence of 10 years or more.",目前尚不清楚他何时受审。与国家安全有关的指控是保密的，审判闭门进行。从事间谍活动可判处10年或以上徒刑。
"Mr. Dong began working at Guangming Daily in 1987, after graduating from the prestigious Peking University law school.",董郁玉从著名的北京大学法学院毕业后，于1987年开始在《光明日报》工作。
"He had long been interested in promoting the rule of law and an independent judiciary, his family said topics on which the government in earlier decades had allowed public debate.",他的家人说，他长期以来一直对促进法治和司法独立感兴趣——对于这些话题，政府在前几十年是允许公开讨论的。
"He wrote a piece encouraging the government to offer more loans for poor students, which won an award from the All-China Journalists Association. In 2012, in a piece for The Times, he worried that the government was overly focused on economic growth, overlooking pollution and other issues.",他写了一篇促进政府为贫困学生提供更多贷款的文章，获得中国记协颁发的一个奖项。2012年，在给时报写的一篇文章中，他担心政府过度关注经济增长，忽视了污染和其他问题。
"In a 2013 review of the Harvard scholar Roderick MacFarquhar's history of the Cultural Revolution, Mr. Dong criticized the party's portrayal of the decade of chaos and bloodshed, which had been led by Mao Zedong, as the work of a few bad actors.",2013年，在为哈佛大学学者马若德(Roderick MacFarquhar)的文革史撰写书评时，董郁玉批评中共将毛泽东领导下的十年动乱和血腥推到几个坏人身上。
"""No matter what internal criteria are used to divide a political party into 'good guys' and 'bad guys,' these people all represent the entire party in formulating and implementing policies,"" he wrote in a liberal history journal. ""Therefore, this party must also take political responsibility for the consequences of these policies.""","""不论依据什么样的党内标准划分出政党内部的'好人'与'坏人'，这些人都代表整个政党在制定和实施政策，""他在一本自由主义的历史杂志上写道。""因此，这个党也必须为这些政策的后果。"""
"Mr. Dong won a Nieman journalism fellowship at Harvard University in 2006. He also was a visiting fellow at Japan's Keio University in 2010, and a visiting professor at Hokkaido University in 2014.",董郁玉于2006年获得哈佛大学尼曼新闻奖学金。他还于2010年在日本庆应义塾大学担任访问学者，并于2014年在北海道大学担任访问教授。
"But the comparatively more open environment at the time ended with Mr. Xi's ascent. In 2017, an investigation of Guangming Daily by party authorities labeled the 2013 book review ""anti-socialist,"" and he was threatened with demotion, Mr. Dong's family said. Mr. Dong was also not a party member, putting him in the minority at the paper.","但当时相对开放的环境随着习近平的上台而结束。董郁玉的家人说，2017年，中共当局对《光明日报》的调查将那篇2013年的书评贴上了""反社会主义""的标签，他受到降级威胁。董郁玉也并非党员，这使他在该报属于少数派。"
"Still, he continued to write. In 2018, under a pen name, which is common for opinions writers at Chinese publications to have, he wrote a widely read critique of local officials in Jiangxi Province for destroying coffins in a campaign to promote cremation.",尽管如此，他笔耕不辍。2018年，他以笔名写了一篇批评江西省地方官员在推广火葬时销毁棺材的文章，被广为流传。中国的撰稿人往往用笔名发表评论。
"And his audience was not only domestic, but also included a community of foreign scholars, journalists and diplomats eager for insight into China's often opaque political and social landscapes. In an open letter in support of Mr. Dong, released on Monday, some of them said he was an ""excellent ambassador for China"" who had always been transparent about their engagements, scheduling meetings in public places.","他的读者不仅来自国内，还有一群外国学者、记者和外交官，他们渴望深入了解中国往往不透明的政治和社会环境。在周一发布的一封支持董郁玉的公开信中，其中一些人称他是一位""优秀的中国大使""，对于接触从来不遮遮掩掩，在公共场所安排会面。"
"Ann Marie Lipinski, the curator of the Nieman fellowship, said in an email that ""any speculation that his journalism fellowship offers evidence of espionage is ill-founded.""","尼曼奖学金的负责人安·玛丽·利平斯基在一封电子邮件中说，""任何关于他的新闻奖学金提供了间谍活动证据的猜测，都是没有根据的。"""
"Mr. Dong's role as an ""interpreter"" of China had become even more important but also riskier in recent years, said John Kamm, the founder of the U.S.-based Dui Hua Foundation, which works to free political prisoners in China. ""This is a loss for understanding between China and the outside world,"" he said.","近年来，董郁玉作为中国""解读者""的角色变得更加重要了——但也更具风险，美国对话基金会的创始人康原(John Kamm)说。该基金会致力于释放中国的政治犯。""这对中国与外界之间的相互理解是一个损失，""他说。"
"Five months after ChatGPT set off an investment frenzy over artificial intelligence, Beijing is moving to rein in China's chatbots, a show of the government's resolve to keep tight regulatory control over technology that could define an era.",在ChatGPT掀起对人工智能技术的投资狂潮五个月后，中国政府正在采取措施控制本国的聊天机器人，展示了政府对可能定义一个时代的技术进行严格监管的决心。
"The Cyberspace Administration of China unveiled draft rules this month for so-called generative artificial intelligence the software systems, like the one behind ChatGPT, that can formulate text and pictures in response to a user's questions and prompts.",中国国家互联网信息办公室本月公布了生成式人工智能服务管理办法征求意见稿。生成式人工智能是一种软件系统，它能根据用户的问题和提示生成文本和图片，支撑ChatGPT的就是这样的系统。
"According to the regulations, companies must heed the Chinese Communist Party's strict censorship rules, just as websites and apps have to avoid publishing material that besmirches China's leaders or rehashes forbidden history. The content of A.I. systems will need to reflect ""socialist core values"" and avoid information that undermines ""state power"" or national unity.","根据该管理办法，公司必须遵守中共严格的审查规定，网站和应用程序必须避免发布诋毁中国领导人或触及历史禁区的内容。人工智能生成的内容需要体现""社会主义核心价值观""，""不得含有颠覆国家政权""或""破坏国家统一""的信息。"
"Companies will also have to make sure their chatbots create words and pictures that are truthful and respect intellectual property, and will be required to register their algorithms, the software brains behind chatbots, with regulators.",公司还必须确保它们的聊天机器人生成的文字和图片是真实的，并尊重知识产权，公司需按照要求将它们的算法(也就是聊天机器人背后的软件)在监管机构备案。
"The rules are not final, and regulators may continue to modify them, but experts said engineers building artificial intelligence services in China were already figuring out how to incorporate the edicts into their products.",虽然管理办法尚未定稿，监管机构也许会继续对其进行修改，但专家表示，在中国构建人工智能服务的工程师们已经在寻找将这些规则置入产品的办法。
"Around the world, governments have been wowed by the power of chatbots with the A.I.-generated results ranging from alarming to benign. Artificial intelligence has been used to ace college exams and create a fake photo of Pope Francis in a puffy coat.",聊天机器人的能力令各国政府惊叹不已，从令人担忧到无伤大雅，人工智能生成的结果不一而足。人工智能已被用来在大学考试中取得优异成绩，还被用来制作了一张教皇方济各穿着白色羽绒服的假照片。
"ChatGPT, developed by the U.S. company OpenAI, which is backed by some $13 billion from Microsoft, has spurred Silicon Valley to apply the underlying technology to new areas like video games and advertising. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital estimates that A.I. businesses could eventually produce ""trillions of dollars"" in economic value.","ChatGPT由美国公司OpenAI开发，微软为OpenAI提供了约130亿美元的支持，这款软件促使硅谷的公司将其背后的技术应用于视频游戏和广告等新领域。据风险投资公司红杉资本估计，人工智能企业最终可能产生""数万亿美元""的经济价值。"
"In China, investors and entrepreneurs are racing to catch up. Shares of Chinese artificial intelligence firms have soared. Splashy announcements have been made by some of China's biggest tech companies, including most recently the e-commerce giant Alibaba; SenseTime, which makes facial recognition software; and the search engine Baidu. At least two start-ups developing Chinese alternatives to OpenAI's technology have raised millions of dollars.",在中国，投资者和企业家们正在竞相迎头赶上。人工智能公司的股价飙升。一些最大的科技企业都在大张旗鼓地宣布推出相关产品，包括最近的电子商务巨头阿里巴巴、制造人脸识别软件的商汤科技，以及搜索引擎百度。至少有两家开发OpenAI技术中国替代产品的初创企业已筹集到了数百万美元的资金。
"ChatGPT is unavailable in China. But faced with a growing number of homegrown alternatives, China has swiftly unveiled its red lines for artificial intelligence, ahead of other countries that are still considering how to regulate chatbots.",ChatGPT在中国无法使用。但面对越来越多的本土替代品，中国政府迅速公布了人工智能的红线，抢在了其他仍在考虑如何监管聊天机器人的国家的前头。
"The rules showcase China's ""move fast and break things"" approach to regulation, said Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy at Trivium China, a Beijing-based consulting firm.","这些规定展示了中国""快速行动，先破后立""的监管做法，总部设在北京的策纬咨询公司的科技政策主管凯娜(Kendra Schaefer)说。"
"""Because you don't have a two-party system where both sides argue, they can just say, 'OK, we know we need to do this, and we'll revise it later,'"" she added.","""因为不是两党制，没有对如何做争论不休的两方，他们可以直接说，'好，我们知道我们需要做这个，我们做了再说'，""她补充道。"
"Chatbots are trained on large swaths of the internet, and developers are grappling with the inaccuracies and surprises of what they sometimes spit out. On their face, China's rules require a level of technical control over chatbots that Chinese tech companies have not achieved. Even companies like Microsoft are still fine-tuning their chatbots to weed out harmful responses. China has a much higher bar, which is why some chatbots have already been shut down and others are available only to a limited number of users.",聊天机器人使用互联网上的大量信息进行训练，开发人员正在努力解决它们吐出的答案有时候不准确、出乎意料的问题。从表面上看，中国的规定要求在一个技术层次控制聊天机器人，而中国的科技公司目前还做不到这点。就连像微软这样的公司仍在对它们的聊天机器人进行微调，以剔除机器人给出的有害回答。中国的要求高得多，这就是为什么一些聊天机器人已经被封，而另一些仅供少数用户使用。
"Experts are divided on how difficult it will be to train A.I. systems to be consistently factual. Some doubt that companies can account for the gamut of Chinese censorship rules, which are often sweeping, are ever-changing and even require censorship of specific words and dates like June 4, 1989, the day of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Others believe that over time, and with enough work, the machines can be aligned with truth and specific values systems, even political ones.",对于如何训练人工智能系统，使其始终如一地提供与事实相符的答案，专家们对此事的难度存在分歧。一些人对科技公司能否满足中国全方位的审查规定表示怀疑，这些规定通常涉及的内容广泛，而且处在不断变化中，甚至需要审查特定的词语和日子，比如1989年6月4日，那是军队镇压天安门广场民主示威的日子。还有人认为，随着时间的推移和工作做到位，机器人能与真理和特定的价值体系保持一致，甚至是政治价值体系保持一致。
Analysts expect the rules to undergo changes after consultation with China's tech companies. Regulators could soften their enforcement so the rules don't wholly undermine development of the technology.,分析人士预计，与中国科技公司磋商后，管理办法会发生变化。监管机构可能放松执行力度，这样就不至于从整体上削弱人工智能技术的发展。
"China has a long history of censoring the internet. Throughout the 2000s, the countryhas constructed the world's most powerful information dragnet over the web. It scared away noncompliant Western companies like Google and Facebook. It hired millions of workers to monitor internet activity.",中国对互联网的审查由来已久。政府在本世纪的前十年里建起了世界上最强大的网络信息监管系统。这吓跑了谷歌和 Facebook等不服从的西方公司。政府雇了数百万人来监控互联网上的活动。
"All the while, China's tech companies, which had to comply with the rules, flourished, defying Western critics who predicted that political control would undercut growth and innovation. As technologies such as facial recognition and mobile phones arose, companies helped the state harness them to create a surveillance state.",与此同时，不得不遵守审查规定的中国科技公司却蓬勃发展起来，这让西方批评人士对政治控制会削弱增长和创新的预测落空。随着人脸识别技术和手机的出现，中国的科技公司帮助政府利用这些技术来建造一个监控国家。
"The current A.I. wavepresents new risksfor the Communist Party, said Matt Sheehan, anexperton Chinese A.I.and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",当前的人工智能浪潮给中共带来了新的风险，研究中国人工智能方面的专家、卡内基国际和平基金会研究员马特·希恩说。
"The unpredictability of chatbots, which will make statements that are nonsensical or falsewhat A.I. researchers call hallucination runs counter to the party's obsession with managing what is said online, Mr. Sheehan said.","希恩表示，聊天机器人的不可预测性会让其做出荒谬或错误的(也就是研究人员称为""幻觉""的)陈述，这与中共痴迷于管理网上言论的做法背道而驰。"
"""Generative artificial intelligence put into tension two of the top goals of the party: the control of information and leadership in artificial intelligence,"" he added.","""生成式人工智能给中共的两个主要目标制造了矛盾:一个是控制信息，一个是在人工智能方面领先，""他补充说。"
"China's new regulations are not entirely about politics, experts said. For example, they aim to protect privacy and intellectual property for individuals and creators of the data upon which A.I. models are trained, a topic of worldwide concern.",专家表示，中国的新规定并不完全是关于政治的。例如，政府也要保护个人隐私和数据创建者的知识产权，这是全世界都关心的话题，因为训练人工智能系统依靠数据。
"In February, Getty Images, the image database company, sued the artificial intelligence start-up Stable Diffusion for training its image-generating system on 12 million watermarked photos, which Getty claimed diluted the value of its images.",今年2月，图像数据库公司Getty Images起诉了人工智能初创公司Stable Diffusion，后者用1200万张带水印的图片训练了自己的图像生成系统，Getty声称该公司的做法稀释了其图片的价值。
"China is making a broader push to address legal questions about A.I. companies' use of underlying data and content. In March, as part of a major institutional overhaul, Beijing established the National Data Bureau, an effort to better define what it means to own, buy and sell data. The state body would also assist companies with building the data sets necessary to train such models.",为了解决有关人工智能公司使用底层数据和内容的法律问题，中国正在采取措施，从更高层面予以推动。今年3月，中国成立了国家数据局，这是重大机构改革的一部分，是为了更好地定义拥有数据、买卖数据的含义。国家数据局还将协助公司建立训练人工智能模型所需的数据集。
"""They are now deciding what kind of property data is and who has the rights to use it and control it,"" said Ms. Schaefer, who has written extensively on China's A.I. regulations and called the initiative ""transformative.""","""他们现在正在决定数据属于什么样的财产，谁有权使用和控制数据，""凯娜说道，她写过大量有关中国人工智能监管的文章，她认为该管理办法是""变革性的""。"
"Still, China's new guardrails may be ill timed. The country is facing intensifying competition and sanctions on semiconductors that threaten to undermine its competitiveness in technology, including artificial intelligence.",尽管如此，中国的新护栏可能不合时宜。中国在半导体方面正临着日益激烈的竞争和制裁，这可能会削弱中国在包括人工智能在内的技术上的竞争力。
"Hopes for Chinese A.I. ran high in early February when Xu Liang, an A.I. engineer and entrepreneur, released one of China's earliest answers to ChatGPT as a mobile app. The app, ChatYuan, garnered over 10,000 downloads in the first hour, Mr. Xu said.",今年2月初，人们曾对中国的人工智能充满希望，当时人工智能工程师兼企业家徐亮发布了一款手机应用，那是中国对ChatGPT的最早回应。徐亮表示，这款名为元语智能的应用程序在第一个小时里就获得了超过1万次下载。
"Media reports of marked differences between the party line and ChatYuan's responses soon surfaced. Responses offered a bleak diagnosis of the Chinese economy and described the Russian war in Ukraine as a ""war of aggression,"" at odds with the party's more pro-Russia stance. Days later, the authorities shut down the app.","很快就出现了元语智能的回答与党的路线明显不符的媒体报道。这些回答对中国经济的描述十分黯淡，还将俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争描述为""侵略战争""，这与中共的亲俄立场背道而驰。几天后，当局关闭了这款应用程序。"
"Mr. Xu said he was adding measures to create a more ""patriotic"" bot. They include filtering out sensitive keywords and hiring more manual reviewers who can help him flag problematic answers. He is even training a separate model that can detect ""incorrect viewpoints,"" which he will filter.","徐亮表示，他正在增加措施，以创造一个更""爱国""的机器人。这些措施包括过滤掉敏感的关键词，雇佣更多的人工审查者来帮助标记有问题的答案。他甚至正在训练另外一个能检测到""不正确观点""的模型，这样就能将这些观点过滤掉。"
"Still, it is not clear when Mr. Xu's bot will ever satisfy the authorities. The app was initially set to resume on Feb. 13, according to screenshots, but as of Friday it was still down.",尽管如此，徐亮的机器人何时才能让当局满意目前尚不清楚。截屏显示，元语智能预计恢复时间是2月13日，但截至周五仍处于关闭状态。
"""Service will resume after troubleshooting is complete,"" it read.","""系统更新维护中，""程序界面上的文字显示。"
"Early in 2020, on the same day that a frightening new illness officially got the name Covid-19, a team of scientists from the United States and China released critical data showing how quickly the virus was spreading, and who was dying.","2020年初，在一种可怕的新疾病被正式命名为""Covid-19""的同一天，一个由美国和中国科学家组成的团队发布了关键数据，显示该病毒的传播速度以及对哪些人最致命。"
The study was cited in health warnings around the world and appeared to be a model of international collaboration in a moment of crisis.,世界各地发布的健康警告都在援引该研究，它似乎成为了危机时刻国际合作的典范。
"Within days, though, the researchers quietly withdrew the paper, which was replaced online by a message telling scientists not to cite it. A few observers took note of the peculiar move, but the whole episode quickly faded amid the frenzy of the coronavirus pandemic.",然而，几天之内，研究人员悄悄撤回了这篇论文，以一条信息取代，告诉科学家们不要引用该论文。一些观察人士注意到了这个异常的举动，但整件事在新冠大流行病的恐慌中很快就消失了。
"What is now clear is that the study was not removed because of faulty research. Instead, it was withdrawn at the direction of Chinese health officials amid a crackdown on science. That effort kicked up a cloud of dust around the dates of early Covid cases, like those reported in the study.",现在我们很清楚的是，这项研究并不是因为研究错误而被删除，而是在一项对科学的打压行动中，在中国卫生官员的指示下被删除的。这一努力为早期新冠病例，例如那些该研究提到的病例的出现时间蒙上了一层阴影。
"""It was so hard to get any information out of China,"" said one of the authors, Ira Longini, of the University of Florida, who described the back story of the removal publicly for the first time in a recent interview. ""There was so much covered up, and so much hidden.""","""从中国获得任何信息都很难，""其中一位论文合著者、佛罗里达大学的艾拉·朗吉尼说。他在最近的一次采访中首次公开描述了该研究被撤回背后的故事。""太多信息被掩盖，被隐藏。"""
"That the Chinese government muzzled scientists, hindered international investigations and censored online discussion of the pandemic is well documented. But Beijing's stranglehold on information goes far deeper than even many pandemic researchers are aware of. Its censorship campaign has targeted international journals and scientific databases, shaking the foundations of shared scientific knowledge, a New York Times investigation found.",中国政府让科学家封口、阻碍国际调查，以及对关于大流行病的在线讨论加以审查，这些均有据可查。但北京对信息的控制比许多流行病研究人员所意识到的要更为深入。《纽约时报》的一项调查发现，其审查活动将目标对准国际期刊和科学数据库，动摇了共享科学知识的基础。
"Under pressure from their government, Chinese scientists have withheld data, withdrawn genetic sequences from public databases and altered crucial details in journal submissions. Western journal editors enabled those efforts by agreeing to those edits or withdrawing papers for murky reasons, a review by The Times of over a dozen retracted papers found.",中国科学家因政府的压力而隐瞒了数据，从公共数据库中撤回了基因序列，并修改了向期刊提交的论文的关键细节。时报对十几篇被撤回的论文进行审查后发现，西方期刊编辑出于不明原因同意了修改或撤回了论文，从而给这些行为提供了帮助。
Groups including the World Health Organization have given credence to muddled data and inaccurate timelines.,包括世界卫生组织在内的团体让混乱的数据和不准确的时间线有了可信度。
"This scientific censorship has not universally succeeded: The original version of the February 2020 paper, for example, can still be found online with some digging. But the campaign starved doctors and policymakers of critical information about the virus at the moment the world needed it most. It bred mistrust of science in Europe and the United States, as health officials cited papers from China that were then retracted.",这种对科学研究的审查并没有全面奏效:例如，仔细检阅后，仍然可以在网上找到2020年2月论文的原始版本。但这场运动使医生和政策制定者在世界最需要的时候无法获得有关该病毒的关键信息。它在欧洲和美国滋生了对科学的不信任，因为卫生官员引用了来自中国的论文，而这些论文随后被撤回。
The crackdown continues to breed misinformation today and has hindered efforts to determine the origins of the virus.,这场压制行动至今仍在持续滋生错误信息，并阻碍了确定病毒来源的努力。
"Such censorship spilled into public view recently, when an international group of scientists discovered genetic sequence data that Chinese researchers had collected from a Wuhan market in January 2020 but withheld from foreign experts for three years a delay that global health officials called ""inexcusable.""","近日，这样的审查进入了公众视野，一个国际科学家小组发现了中国研究人员于2020年1月从武汉市场收集到的、但对外国专家隐瞒了三年的基因序列数据——全球卫生官员称这一延迟是""不可原谅的""。"
"The sequences showed that raccoon dogs, a fox-like animal, had deposited genetic signatures in the same place that genetic material from the virus was left, a finding consistent with a scenario in which the virus spread to people from illegally traded market animals.",序列显示，在病毒基因物质留存的同一位置发现了一种类似狐狸的动物貉留下的基因特征，这一发现与病毒从市场上非法交易的动物传播给人类的情况相符。
"The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. At a news conference this month, scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention called such criticism ""intolerable.""","中国驻华盛顿大使馆没有回应置评请求。在本月的新闻发布会上，中国疾控中心的科学家称这种批评是""无法容忍的""。"
"It is impossible to ascribe a single motive to the crackdown. Beijing controls and shapes information as a matter of course, particularly in moments of crisis. But some of the censorship changed the timeline of early infections, a delicate topic as the government faced criticism over whether it responded to the outbreak quickly enough.",几乎无法将这种信息压制归咎于单一动机。对北京来说，控制和塑造信息是理所当然的事，尤其是在危机时刻。但一些审查改变了早期感染的时间线，早期的感染是一个敏感话题，因为中国政府在应对疫情是否足够迅速方面面临批评。
There is no evidence that the censorship is designed to conceal a specific scenario for the origins of the pandemic. Some scientists believe that Covid-19 spread naturally from animals to humans. Others argue that it may have spread from a Chinese laboratory. Both sides have pointed to censored data to support their theories.,没有证据表明审查制度旨在掩盖大流行起源的某个场景。一些科学家认为，新冠从动物自然传播到人类。另一些人则认为可能是从中国实验室传播的。双方都指向那些被审查的数据以支持他们的理论。
But they have come to agree on one point: The Chinese government's grip on science has stifled the search for truth.,但他们在一点上达成了一致:中国政府对科学的控制扼杀了对真相的探索。
"""I think there's a major political agenda that is impacting the science,"" said Edward Holmes, a University of Sydney biologist who was part of the group that analyzed the sequences containing raccoon dog DNA.","""我认为有一个严重的政治议程正在影响科学，""悉尼大学生物学家爱德华·霍姆斯说，他是分析了含有貉DNA序列的小组的成员。"
"Soon after the group alerted Chinese researchers to their findings, the genetic sequences temporarily disappeared from a global database. ""It's just pathetic that we're in this stage where we're having cloak-and-dagger conversations about deleted data,"" Dr. Holmes said.","该小组将他们的发现告知中国研究人员，不久后这些基因序列一度从全球数据库中消失。霍姆斯表示:""我们在偷偷摸摸讨论被删除的数据，走到这一步实在是可悲。"""
Ever-Changing Dates,不断变化的日期
"For a brief moment, the coronavirus appeared to challenge China's notoriously tough hold on information. On Feb. 6, 2020, when averting a pandemic still seemed possible, the Chinese internet lit up with the death of Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who had been punished for warning about the outbreak before falling ill himself.",在一段短暂的时期里，新冠病毒似乎挑战了中国臭名昭著的严格信息控制。2020年2月6日，当避免一场大流行似乎仍有可能的时候，中国互联网因李文亮去世的消息而沸腾了。李文亮是一名武汉医生，在生病前因就疫情发出警告而受到惩罚。
"Anger boiled over. People sensed that officials had withheld lifesaving information. Across China, they asked: How many had caught the virus in December? Who had known? Why hadn't more been done?",愤怒爆发了。人们感觉到官员在隐瞒能拯救生命的信息。在中国各地，人们质问:有多少人在12月感染了病毒?谁知道这些情况?为什么没有采取更多措施?
"Around that time, researchers confirmed that the virus had been spreading for weeks from human to human, a fact that Chinese officials had initially dismissed.",大约在那个时候，研究人员证实，这种病毒已经在人与人之间传播了数周，中国官员最初否认了这一事实。
"The Chinese government reacted by tightening online censorship and wresting control of research. The censorship was piecemeal at first. The Ministry of Science and Technology told scientists to prioritize handling the outbreak, not publishing papers. One European scientist recalled his Chinese collaborators asking him to sign a nondisclosure agreement promising not to share data on research that had already been published.",中国政府的反应是加强网络审查，并夺取对研究的控制权。起初的审查是零散的。科技部要求科学家优先处理疫情，而不是发表论文。一位欧洲科学家回忆道，他的中国合作者要求他签署一份保密协议，承诺不分享已经发表的研究数据。
"Soon, Chinese researchers were asking journals to retract their work. Journals can withdraw papers for a number of legitimate reasons, like flawed data. But a review of more than a dozen retracted papers from China shows a pattern of revising or suppressing research on early cases, conditions for medical workers and how widely the virus had spread topics that could make the government look bad. The retracted papers reviewed by The Times had been flagged by Retraction Watch, a group that tracks withdrawn research.","很快，中国研究人员要求期刊撤下自己的论文。期刊可以出于一些合理的原因撤回论文，比如有缺陷的数据。但是，对来自中国的十几篇撤回论文的回顾显示，中国存在一种模式，即修改或压制有关早期病例、医务工作者条件及病毒传播范围的研究——这些话题可能会有损政府形象。时报审查的撤稿论文都已经被追踪撤稿研究的组织""撤稿观察""标记出来。"
Among them were a study that included infected children in southern China; a survey of depression and anxiety among Chinese medical workers who had been treating Covid-19 patients; and even a letter published in The Lancet Global Health by two nurses who described the desperation they felt while working in hospitals in Wuhan.,其中包括对中国南方受感染儿童的研究;对治疗新冠患者的中国医务人员抑郁和焦虑情况的调查;甚至还有两名护士在《柳叶刀全球健康》上发表的一封信，描述了她们在武汉医院工作时的绝望。
"""Even experienced nurses may also cry,"" they wrote.","""即使是经验丰富的护士也会哭，""她们写道。"
"Journals are typically slow to retract papers, even when they are shown to be fraudulent or unethical. But in China, the calculus is different, said Ivan Oransky, a founder of Retraction Watch. Journals that want to sell subscriptions in China or publish Chinese research often bend to the government's demands. ""Scientific publishers have really gone out of their way to placate the censorship requests,"" he said.","期刊撤回论文的速度通常很慢，即使它们被证明存在欺诈或有违伦理。但""撤稿观察""的创始人之一伊万·奥兰斯基说，在中国，情况有所不同。想要在中国征订或发表中国研究成果的期刊往往屈从于政府的要求。他说:""科学出版商确实竭尽全力去取悦审查要求。"""
"As the virus spread, China formalized its controls. A government task force was put in charge of all coronavirus research. Officials in the eastern province of Zhejiang discussed ""strengthening the management"" of scientific results, records show.","随着病毒的传播，中国采取了固定的信息控制措施，将所有的新冠病毒研究纳入一个政府工作组的统一管理。有记载显示，浙江省的官员讨论了""加强科研成果信息发布管理""。"
"Then on March 9, scientists from top Chinese laboratories published a paper about how the coronavirus might be mutating. The research appeared in Clinical Infectious Diseases, a prestigious journal published by Oxford University Press.",在那之后的3月9日，来自中国顶级实验室的科学家们发表了一篇关于新冠病毒可能如何变异的论文。这项研究发表在牛津大学出版社旗下的著名期刊《临床传染病》上。
"The topic was seemingly apolitical, but it relied on samples collected from patients in Wuhan starting in mid-December 2019. That added to evidence that the virus was spreading widely before the Chinese government took action.",虽然这个研究课题看似与政治无关，但它用的是从2019年12月中旬起从武汉患者身上采集的样本。这进一步证明了新冠病毒在中国政府采取行动之前就已经广泛传播。
"The paper landed just as the government formalized its censorship policy. The following day, China's Ministry of Education ordered universities to submit research topics to the government task force for approval, according to a directive posted on a university's website.",这篇论文出来时正是政府将审查政策正规化之际。第二天，据出现在一所大学网站上的通知，中国教育部要求高等学校如要发表研究信息需提交政府工作组审核同意。
"Those who did not vet their scientific projects or who caused ""serious adverse social impacts"" would be punished, the directive said.","通知说，未按规定报批或造成""严重不良社会影响的""科研人员将受到惩罚。"
"The move sent a chill through Chinese science. Schools tightened restrictions on faculty media interviews and instructed professors to comply with the directive, university notices show.",此举令中国科学界不寒而栗。大学网站上的信息显示，学校加强了对教学人员接受媒体采访的限制，并发通知要求教授按照教育部的规定去做。
"The journal retractions continued, and for unusual reasons.",从期刊上撤稿仍在继续，而且原因不同寻常。
"One group of authors noted that ""our data is not perfect enough."" Another warned that its paper ""cannot be used as the basis for the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2."" A third said its findings were ""incomplete and not ready for publication."" Several scientists promised in retraction notices to update their findings but never did.","一个作者团队给出的原因是，""我们的数据还不够完善。""另一团队警告，其论文""不能作为SARS-CoV-2起源和演化的依据""。第三个团队表示，其研究结果""不完整，还没有准备要发表""。有几名科学家在撤稿声明中承诺更新他们的研究结果，但一直没有那样做。"
"Because Chinese scientists have been muzzled, it is difficult to neatly distinguish between censored papers and those retracted for legitimate scientific reasons.",因为中国科学家被封口，所以很难清楚地区分哪些论文撤稿是因为审查，哪些是出于正当合理的科学原因。
The censorship helped the government tell a story.,这些审查帮助了政府的叙事。
"""China emerged from the pandemic as an early winner,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert at Seton Hall University. ""They started to present a new narrative on the outbreak, in terms of not just the origin, but also in terms of the government's role in responding to the pandemic.""","""中国很早就以优胜者的形象走出了大流行，""西顿霍尔大学全球卫生专家黄严忠说。""他们开始对疫情做出新的叙事，不仅从病毒起源的角度，而且从政府应对大流行的作用的角度。"""
"Two months after posting the paper on coronavirus mutations, Clinical Infectious Diseases published an update. The new version said that the Wuhan samples were not collected in December after all, but weeks later, in January.",在发表了有关新冠病毒变异的论文两个月后，《临床传染病》刊登了一个更新。更新的版本称，武汉的病毒样本总归不是2019年12月采集的，而是在几周后的次年1月采集的。
"The paper's corresponding author, Li Mingkun of the Beijing Institute of Genomics, did not respond to requests for comment.",该论文的通讯作者、北京基因组研究所的李明锟没有回应置评请求。
"After Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle tweeted about the discrepancy, the journal's editors posted a third version of the paper, adding yet another timeline. This revision says the samples were collected between Dec. 30 and Jan. 1.",西雅图弗雷德·哈钦森癌症中心的杰西·布鲁姆在Twitter上指出了这个差异后，期刊编辑发布了这篇论文的第三个版本，添加了又一个时间线。这次修改称，样本的采集时间是12月30日至1月1日。
"A correction merely says that the previous dates had been ""unclear.""","该期刊刊登的更正只是说之前的日期""不明确""。"
"In an email to The Times, the journal editors said the correction was ""the most appropriate approach to clarify the scientific record.""","该期刊的编辑在发给时报的一封电子邮件中写道，发表更正是""澄清科学记录的最合适做法""。"
An Origin Mystery,起源之谜
Chinese scientists ignored requests for years to release information about swabs taken from surfaces at the Wuhan market. That refusal has hindered efforts to determine how the pandemic began.,中国科学家多年来一直不理睬外界提出的公布从武汉市场各个表面采集的样本信息的要求。这种拒绝阻碍了明确大流行起源的努力。
"Dr. Holmes, the University of Sydney biologist, said that as far back as two years ago, he stressed to Chinese researchers the importance of those samples. He even sent them a raccoon dog genome sequence, hoping they would compare it with samples from the market. The researchers did not make the data public until this year.",悉尼大学生物学家霍姆斯表示，早在两年前，他就向中国研究人员强调了这些样本的重要性。他甚至将貉的基因组序列发给了他们，希望他们能用这个基因组序列与市场上采集的样本进行比较。研究人员直到今年才将数据公开。
"The World Health Organization, the supposed repository for reliable information about the virus, has only added to confusion about the pandemic's origins. After errors were found in a major March 2021 report from the organization and China, an agency spokesman, Tarik Jasarevic, promised that officials would correct the mistakes.",世界卫生组织本应是有关该病毒的可靠信息存放处，但它反而增加了人们对大流行起源的困惑。人们在2021年3月来自世卫组织和中国的一份重要报告中发现了一些错误后，世卫组织发言人塔里克·亚沙雷维奇曾承诺，官员们将纠正这些错误。
"Two years later, they have not. The flawed report remains online, painting an inaccurate timeline of the earliest known cases. Mr. Jasarevic now refers questions about the report to the scientists who prepared it.",两年过去了，他们并没有纠正。那份存在错误的报告仍在网上，继续提供一个不准确的最早已知病例时间表。亚沙雷维奇现在把有关报告的问题送交给那些拟定报告的科学家们来回答。
"""That's a deep and in many ways unforgivable mystery, when the data were demonstrated to be false,"" said Lawrence Gostin, the faculty director of Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law and a longtime W.H.O. adviser. ""It either shows that W.H.O. wasn't insistent enough with China, or that China simply didn't cooperate.""","""当数据被证明不正确时，那是一个很大的、在许多方面都无法原谅的谜，""乔治城大学奥尼尔国家和全球卫生法研究所所长劳伦斯·戈斯汀说，他长期担任世卫组织的顾问。""这要么表明世卫组织对中国的要求不够坚决，要么表明中国根本就不合作。"""
Some scientists have become similarly suspicious that China's censorship has affected the genetic databases that underpin worldwide research.,一些科学家也同样怀疑，中国的审查制度影响了支撑全球研究的基因数据库。
"Dr. Bloom, the Seattle evolutionary virologist, was poring over tables in a scientific paper in June 2021 when he discovered that dozens of gene sequences had been deleted from the Sequence Read Archive, a U.S. government database. The sequences, from early 2020, had been submitted by scientists from Wuhan University. But they had curiously vanished.",2021年6月，西雅图的病毒演化专家布鲁姆在研读一篇科学论文中的表格时，发现数十个基因序列已从美国政府的数据库Sequence Read Archive中被删除。这些来自2020年初的序列由武汉大学科学家提交，但后来奇怪地消失了。
"The U.S. government's National Library of Medicine, which manages the database, said at the time that the Wuhan researchers had asked that the sequences be withdrawn and implied that it was the only instance during the pandemic in which data was removed at the request of scientists in China.",管理该数据库的是美国政府的国家医学图书馆，它当时表示，这些序列是武汉的研究人员要求撤回的，并暗示，在大流行期间应中国科学家要求删除数据仅此一例。
"But a March 2022 review by an outside consultant showed that the scientists withdrew another, unrelated sequence on the same day. After Dr. Bloom published a paper about the deleted Wuhan University sequences, they reappeared online but most had been moved to a database affiliated with the Chinese government.",但一名外部顾问2022年3月的审查显示，武汉的科学家们在同一天撤回了另一组不相关的序列。在布鲁姆博士发表了一篇关于被删除的武汉大学序列的论文后，它们重新出现在网上——但大部分已被转移到与一个中国政府有关联的数据库中。
This controversy and the recent dust-up over the discovered-then-deleted-then-recovered raccoon dog DNA from a separate database have prompted calls for transparency from these genetic archives.,这个争议，以及最近有关另一个数据库中发现、删除然后又恢复的貉DNA引发的争吵促使人们呼吁这些基因数据库保持透明。
"Virginie Courtier-Orgogozo, an evolutionary biologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research, said all pandemic-related sequences should be released to global health experts, particularly from early samples. ""Among people who were sick in December, we have less than 20 sequences,"" she said. (The National Library of Medicine said that sharing withdrawn data was against its policy.)","法国国家科学研究中心的进化生物学家维尔日妮·库尔捷-奥尔戈戈佐表示，所有与大流行相关的序列都应该向全球卫生专家公开，尤其是早期样本的序列。""我们只有来自2019年12月的患者的不到20个序列，""她说。(国家医学图书馆表示，共享撤回的数据违反其政策。)"
The Chinese government's grip on science continues.,中国政府对科学研究的控制仍在继续。
"The laboratory of a Chinese scientist who studies the wildlife trade was recently shuttered while the authorities investigated unfounded concerns that its research related to the origins of the pandemic, according to a scientist outside China who collaborated on the work.",一名研究野生动物贸易的中国科学家的实验室最近被关闭，当局毫无根据地担心这个实验室的研究与大流行病的起源有关，正在对其进行调查，据一名参与该研究的境外科学家表示。
"On April 1, Beijing limited foreign access to the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, an academic portal, curtailing insight into research there. Leaders have urged Chinese scientists to publish in domestic journals rather than international publications.",今年4月1日，中国政府对从海外访问学术门户网站中国知网进行了限制，限制了外界对那里的学术成果的了解。领导人敦促中国科学家把研究论文发表在国内期刊上，而不是国际出版物上。
"And this month, Chinese government scientists said it was time to start investigating outside China for the virus's origins.",本月，中国政府的科学家表示，是时候开始在中国境外调查新冠病毒的起源了。
It was a nod to the widely refuted claim that the pandemic began somewhere else.,这是对受到广泛驳斥的大流行源于其他地方这一说法的认同。
"A dozen people have been detained in connection with a hospital fire in Beijing that has claimed the lives of at least 29 victims, the Chinese authorities said on Wednesday, attributing the blaze to possible negligence after sparks from internal construction ignited flammable paint.",中国当局周三表示，与北京长峰医院火灾有关的12人已被刑拘，这场火灾已夺去至少29人的生命，当局表示，火灾是由住院部内部改造施工作业过程中产生的火花引燃现场可燃涂料的挥发物所致。
"At a news conference on Wednesday, officials said most of the deceased were patients at Changfeng Hospital when the fire erupted around midday Tuesday in the southwestern part of Beijing. A nurse, a medical worker and a relative of a patient also died in the fire. Another 21 people were hospitalized in critical or serious condition.",在周三的新闻发布会上，官员们表示，火灾发生在周二中午左右，大多数死者是长峰医院的病人。该医院位于北京西南部。另有一名护士、一名护工和一名患者家属也在火灾中丧生。还有21名危重伤病员在住院治疗。
"A woman who lives in an apartment complex near the hospital, overlooking the section where the fire broke out, said that she started hearing people screaming for help around 1 p.m. the day before.",一名住在医院附近的女士说，前一天，她在下午1点左右开始听到人们大声求救。她住的公寓楼可以俯瞰发生火灾的院区。
"""I looked outside, and the sky was all black,"" said the woman, who declined to give her name.","""我街上一看，天都是黑的，""这位不愿透露姓名的女士说。"
"The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared attention from the authorities, said she saw three people two men and a woman jump from a window on the second highest floor to a ledge protruding from the building, with one crumpling after landing. She showed photos on her phone of a person leaning out of the window.",因害怕受到当局关注，这位女士要求匿名，她表示，她看到有两男一女从大楼顶层往下数的第二层窗户跳到下面的平台上，其中一人在落地后跌倒。她打开手机上的照片，可以看到一人将身体探出窗外。
"""They were crawling from the windows, and I was scared they would fall,"" she said.""","""他们往窗户爬，我怕他们摔倒，""她说。"
"The fire appeared to be the deadliest in the Chinese capital in more than two decades, with the toll exceeding that of a 2002 fire at an internet cafe in the Haidian university district that killed 25 students and shocked the nation.",这场火灾似乎是20多年来在中国首都发生的最致命火灾，死亡人数超过了2002年的海淀网吧大火，那场发生在大学区的火灾导致25名学生丧生，震惊了全国。
"In the initial hours after Tuesday's fire, government censors sought to quell public anger by restricting information on the internet.",在周二火灾发生后的最初几个小时内，政府审查员试图通过限制互联网上的信息来平息公众的愤怒。
"Chinese censors typically go on high alert after major tragedies involving public safety, attuned to the risk that grief and anger hold the potential to spur demonstrations of broader dissatisfaction with the Communist Party.",在发生涉及公共安全的重大悲剧后，中国的审查人员通常会保持高度警惕，担心悲痛和愤怒可能会引发对共产党更广泛的不满情绪。
"On Wednesday morning, the censors appeared to relax as online conversation about the blaze suddenly soared to the top of trending topics on Chinese social media platforms.",周三早上，审查人员似乎有所放松，网上对这场火灾的讨论突然飙升至中国社交媒体平台热搜榜首。
Local officials apologized for the fire and said they would learn from the tragedy.,当地官员为火灾道歉，并表示他们将从这场悲剧中吸取教训。
"""We feel deeply responsible and guilty,"" said Li Zongrong, a deputy district mayor of Beijing's Fengtai district, the area where the hospital is. ""I would like to express our deep condolences to the victims, sincere greetings to the families of the victims, the injured and their relatives, and apologies to the people of the city.""","""我们深感自责和内疚，""医院所在地北京丰台区副区长李宗荣说。""向遇难者表示沉痛哀悼，向遇难者家属、受伤人员及亲属致以诚挚问候，向全市人民表示歉意。"""
"Yin Li, the highest ranking Communist Party official for Beijing, visited the hospital and vowed that the authorities would pursue those who were culpable for the fire, according to the Beijing Daily, the city's official newspaper.",据北京市官方报纸《北京日报》报道，北京市委级别最高的官员尹力视察了医院，并承诺当局将追究火灾的责任人。
"A Beijing public security official said the authorities had detained 12 people, including the hospital's director and deputy director, as well as the head of the construction company overseeing the work at the hospital. They were being investigated for possible violations of safety management regulations that resulted in a major incident with serious casualties, the official said.",北京一名公安官员说，当局已经拘留了12人，包括医院院长和副院长，以及负责监督医院工程的建筑公司负责人。该官员称，由于涉嫌违反安全管理规定造成重大人员伤亡事故，他们正在接受调查。
"A preliminary inquiry found that the fire started from a construction project in the hospital's inpatient department, a fire official said.",一名消防官员说，初步调查发现，火灾是由医院住院部的一个建筑工程引起的。
"Officials said the hospital's east building, where the fire broke out, mainly treats critically ill patients. Nearby residents shared pictures and videos on Chinese social media platforms, such as Weibo, that showed how the fire engulfed the hospital, making it difficult for patients who were on the upper floors to evacuate.",有关官员说，发生火灾的医院住院部东楼主要治疗危重病人。附近的居民在微博等中国社交媒体平台上分享了图片和视频，从中可以看到大火如何吞没医院，使得住在高层的病人难以撤离。
The average age of the hospital patients who died in the fire was 71.,在火灾中死亡的医院病人平均年龄为71岁。
"Like other medical facilities in China, the Beijing Changfeng Hospital suffered greatly during the pandemic as a result of the country's restrictive ""zero Covid"" policies, which limited the number of patients it could accommodate. Built in 1993 with about 150 beds, the hospital was temporarily shuttered at times during the last few years, according to Chinese newsmagazine Caixin.","与中国的其他医疗机构一样，北京长峰医院在疫情期间遭受了巨大损失，因为中国严格的""清零""政策限制了它能容纳的病人数量。据中国的新闻杂志《财新》报道，该医院建于1993年，约有150张床位，在过去几年里曾多次临时关闭。"
"The Beijing hospital is the flagship facility of a medical care group with branches across China. The publicly traded parent company, also named Beijing Changfeng Hospital, incurred significant losses during the pandemic. It lost a combined 66 million yuan, or about $9.5 million, in 2020 and 2021, and an additional $4.6 million in the first half of 2022.",北京的这座医院是一家医疗集团的旗舰机构，该集团在中国各地设有分支。其上市母公司也叫北京长峰医院，在疫情期间遭受了重大损失。该公司在2020年和2021年共亏损人民币6600万元，2022年上半年又亏损3264万元。
"The 29 deaths put this blaze just below the threshold reserved for fires considered the most serious killing more than 30 people or causing 100 million yuan, or $13 million, in damage. Investigations of such fires must be led by the State Council, or China's cabinet.",这场大火的死亡人数达到29人，略低于特别重大事故的门槛——造成30人以上死亡或造成1亿元人民币的损失。对此类火灾的调查必须由中国国务院领导。
"The last disaster to receive that designation was a factory fire in Anyang, a city in Henan Province, that killed 38 people in November, but such blazes have been increasingly rare, a sign of the country's progress in implementing tougher fire regulations.",上一次被认定为特别重大事故的火灾是去年11月发生在河南安阳一家工厂的大火，造成38人死亡，但这类火灾越来越罕见，这标志着中国在实施更严格的消防法规方面取得了进展。
"After the fire on Tuesday in Beijing, public safety officials across China conducted impromptu inspections of hospitals and elder-care facilities late into the night to ensure that evacuation routes were not obstructed, according to local media reports.",据当地媒体报道，周二北京发生火灾后，中国各地的公共安全官员对医院和养老机构进行突击检查直到深夜，以确保疏散路线的畅通。
"Beijing held a meeting with officials from across the city on Wednesday to carry out ""comprehensive large-scale inspection and rectification of hidden dangers"" in the capital.","周三，北京召开全市领导干部会议，在首都开展""全市安全生产隐患大排查大整治""。"
"On Chinese social media, people questioned whether the government could have done more to prevent the tragedy.",在中国的社交媒体上，人们质疑政府是否本可以采取更多措施来防止这场悲剧。
"""Hospitals are full of sick, wounded, and weak people, shouldn't they pay more attention to the safety of their surroundings?"" said one comment on Weibo. ""What should family members do?""","""医院都是病伤弱，不应该是更注重环境安全吗?""微博上的一条评论说。""家属怎么办啊?"""
The neighborhood around the hospital was calm on Wednesday evening. Older residents were walking dogs and parents were watching children on tricycles.,周三晚上，医院周围的街区很平静。年长的居民在遛狗，父母照看着骑三轮车的孩子。
A young couple said that police had been stationed nearby all day.,一对年轻夫妇说，警察在附近守了一整天。
"The hospital's eastern section was mostly dark, except for a few illuminated windows on the top floor. Dark stains blanketed the outer wall of the easternmost part of the complex.",医院东楼基本上是漆黑一片，只有顶楼几扇窗户亮着灯。建筑最东面的外墙覆盖着黑色的污渍。
"The western section was illuminated, and people could be seen in the windows. The hospital is still caring for patients but is not receiving new ones, a guard outside it said.",西楼则灯火通明，从窗户里可以看到人影。医院外的一名保安说，医院仍在治疗现有病人，但不再接收新病人。
"Around 8:30 p.m., at least two police cars were parked nearby, and eight uniformed police officers were standing by the hospital entrance.",晚上8点30分左右，至少有两辆警车停在附近，八名身穿制服的警察站在医院门口。
"Despite the rollback of China's one-child policy, and even after more recent incentives urging families to have more children, China's population is steadily shrinking a momentous shift that will soon leave India as the world's most populous nation and have broad rippling effects both domestically and globally.",尽管中国取消了独生子女政策，甚至在近年开始采取激励措施鼓励家庭生育更多子女，该国的人口仍在稳步减少——这一重大转变将很快使印度成为世界上人口最多的国家，并在中国和全球产生广泛的连锁反应。
"The change puts China on the same course of both aging and shrinking as many of its neighbors in Asia, but its path will have outsize effects not just on the regional economy, but on the world at large as well.",这一变化使中国与许多亚洲邻国一样走上老龄化和萎缩的道路，但这条道路不仅会对地区经济产生巨大影响，而且会对整个世界产生巨大影响。
Here's why economists and others are alarmed by the developments.,以下是经济学家和其他人对事态发展感到担忧的原因。
China's shrinking work force could hobble the global economy.,中国不断萎缩的劳动力可能会拖累全球经济。
"For years, China's massive working-age population powered the global economic engine, supplying the factory workers whose cheap labor produced goods that were exported around the world.",多年来，中国庞大的劳动适龄人口为全球经济引擎提供了动力，廉价的工厂工人生产出口到世界各地的产品。
"In the long run, a shortage of factory workers in China driven by a better-educated work force and a shrinking population of young people could raise costs for consumers outside China, potentially exacerbating inflation in countries like the United States that rely heavily on imported Chinese products. Facing rising labor costs in China, many companies have already begun shifting their manufacturing operations to lower-paying countries like Vietnam and Mexico.",从长远来看，中国工厂工人的短缺——由劳动力教育水平提高和年轻人不断减少所推动——可能会提高中国以外消费者的成本，潜在地加剧美国等严重依赖从中国进口产品的国家的通货膨胀。面对中国不断上涨的劳动力成本，许多公司已经开始将制造业务转移到越南和墨西哥等工资较低的国家。
"A shrinking population could also mean a decline in spending by Chinese consumers, threatening global brands dependent on sales of products to China, from Apple smartphones to Nike sneakers.",人口减少还可能意味着中国消费者支出的减少，威胁到从苹果智能手机到耐克运动鞋等依赖向中国销售产品的全球品牌。
The data is bad news for China's crucial housing market.,这些数据对中国至关重要的房地产市场来说是个坏消息。
"In the short term, a plunging birthrate poses a major threat to China's real estate sector, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the country's economic output. Population growth is a key driver of housing demand, and homeownership is the most important asset for many Chinese people. During widespread pandemic lockdowns that dampened consumer spending and export growth, China's economy became even more dependent on the ailing housing sector.",在短期内，出生率下降对中国的房地产业构成了重大威胁，房地产业约占中国经济产出的四分之一。人口增长是住房需求的主要驱动因素，对许多中国人来说，住房是最重要的资产。在大范围的疫情封锁期间，消费支出和出口增长受到抑制，中国经济更加依赖于境况不佳的房地产行业。
"The government recently intervened to help distressed real estate developers, in an attempt to stem the fallout from its housing crisis.",政府最近出手干预，帮助陷入困境的房地产开发商，试图遏制其住房危机的影响。
"China's shrinking work force may not be able to support its growing, aging population.",中国不断萎缩的劳动力可能无法养活不断增长的老龄化人口。
"With fewer working-age people in the long run, the government could struggle to sustain an enormous population that is growing older and living longer. A 2019 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted that the country's main pension fund would run out of money by 2035, in part because of the shrinking work force.",从长远来看，由于劳动年龄人口的减少，日益老龄化和长寿的庞大人口可能令政府难以维持。中国社会科学院2019年的一份报告预测，该国的主要养老基金将在2035年之前耗尽，部分原因是劳动力萎缩。
Economists have compared China's demographic crisis to the one that stalled Japan's economic boom in the 1990s.,经济学家将中国的人口危机与上世纪90年代导致日本经济停滞的人口危机相提并论。
But China does not have the same resources as a country like Japan to provide a safety net for its aging population. Its households live on much lower incomes on average than in the U.S. and elsewhere. Many older Chinese residents rely on state pension payments as a key source of income during retirement.,但中国没有像日本等国那样的资源，来为其老龄化人口提供社会保障。中国家庭的平均收入远低于美国和其他国家。许多中国老年人依靠国家养老金作为退休期间的主要收入来源。
"China also has some of the lowest retirement ages in the world, with most workers retiring by 60. The situation has put a tremendous strain not only on state pension funds, but also on the country's hospital system.",中国也是世界上退休年龄最低的国家之一，大多数工人在60岁之前退休。这种情况给国家养老基金和医院系统都构成巨大压力。
The crisis has been decades in the making.,这场危机已经酝酿了几十年。
"China introduced the one-child policy in the late 1970s, arguing that it was necessary to keep population growth from reaching unsustainable levels. The government imposed onerous fines on most couples who had more than one child, and compelled hundreds of millions of Chinese women to have abortions. Many families favored boys over girls, often aborting baby girls or abandoning them at birth, resulting in a huge surplus of single men in the Chinese population.",中国在20世纪70年代末推出了独生子女政策，认为有必要防止人口增长达到不可持续的水平。政府对大多数生育一个以上孩子的夫妇处以巨额罚款，并迫使数亿中国女性堕胎。许多家庭重男轻女，经常打掉女婴，或在出生时抛弃她们，导致中国人口中单身男性大量过剩。
"China announced the relaxing of the family size restrictions in 2013, but many demographic experts said the change had come too late to change the country's population trajectory.",中国在2013年宣布放宽家庭规模限制，但许多人口专家表示，这一变化来得太晚，无法改变中国的人口轨迹。
There are no easy fixes.,没有简单的解决办法。
"The government's efforts to start a baby boom to solve the demographic crisis including offering cash handouts and easing the one-child policy to allow for three have failed to stabilize falling birthrates. Educated Chinese women are increasingly delaying marriage and choosing not to have children, deterred by the high costs of housing and education.",政府试图启动婴儿潮，以此解决人口危机——包括提供现金补贴和放宽独生子女政策，允许生三胎——但依然未能稳定不断下降的出生率。由于高昂的住房和教育成本，越来越多受过教育的中国女性推迟结婚，选择不生孩子。
"China has also been unwilling to loosen immigration rules to boost the population, and has historically issued relatively few green cards to replenish its shrinking work force.",中国也不愿意放松移民政策来增加人口，而且历来很少发放绿卡来补充不断萎缩的劳动力。
"To address the labor shortage, China has been outsourcing low-skilled production to other countries in Asia, and adding more automation to its factories, hoping to rely more on artificial intelligence and technology sectors for future growth.",为了解决劳动力短缺问题，中国在将低技能的生产外包给亚洲其他国家，并在工厂中增加自动化程度，希望更多地依靠人工智能和技术部门来实现未来的增长。
"Update:Chinese authorities said they have arrested a dozen people in connection witha hospital firein Beijing that has claimed the lives of at least 29 victims, attributing the blaze to possible negligence after sparks from internal construction ignited flammable paint.",更新:周三，中国当局表示，已逮捕了与医院火灾有关的十几个人，这场火灾已夺走至少29人的生命。当局将火灾归因于内部施工产生的火花引燃可燃涂料后可能的疏忽。
"At a news conference on Wednesday, officials said most of the deceased were patients at Changfeng Hospital when the fire erupted around midday Tuesday in the southwestern part of Beijing. A nurse, a medical worker and a relative of a patient also died in the fire. Another 21 people were hospitalized in critical or serious condition.",在周三的新闻发布会上，官员们表示，大多数死者是长峰医院的患者。这场大火于周二中午左右在北京西南部发生。一名护士、一名医务人员和一名患者的亲属也在火灾中丧生。另有21人因危急或严重伤情住院。
---,---
"At least 21 people died after a fire erupted in a hospital in Beijing on Tuesday, forcing patients trapped inside to cram up against windows, awaiting rescue, while at least one jumped to a roof below to escape the flames and smoke. The fire appeared to be the deadliest in the Chinese capital in the past two decades.",周二，北京一家医院发生火灾，造成至少21人死亡，被困在医院内的患者不得不挤靠在窗户上等待救援，同时至少有一人跳到低层的屋顶以躲避大火和浓烟。这似乎是过去20年里中国首都发生的最致命火灾。
"It broke out in an inpatient building of the Changfeng Hospital in the city's south at just before 1 p.m., and firefighters had largely put out the flames within less than 40 minutes, said the brief official report issued by the Beijing Daily, the city's official newspaper. Dozens of patients were evacuated, but by early evening 21 people had died, apparently from the flames and dense smoke.",北京市官方报纸《北京日报》发布的简短官方消息称，下午临近1点时，位于南城的长峰医院的一栋住院楼发生火灾，消防员在不到40分钟内将大火扑灭。数十名患者被疏散，但截至傍晚时分，已有21人死亡，显然死于大火与浓烟。
"The death count may still rise, and the official report did not say whether any bodies may be left in the building. The toll already surpassed a fire in the Daxing District of Beijing in 2017 that killed 19 people in a cramped apartment building housing migrant workers. In 2002, a fire at an internet cafe in the city killed 25.",死亡人数可能还会上升，官方报道没有说明是否有尸体遗留在大楼内。死亡人数已经超过了2017年北京大兴区的一场火灾，那场大火发生在农民工居住的拥挤公寓楼里，导致19人丧生。2002年，北京一家网吧发生火灾，造成25人死亡。
"The latest disaster is a blow to the Chinese capital, which has been returning to normality after nearly three years of heavy pandemic controls were lifted, giving way to a sometimes deadly wave of Covid infections last year. Official Chinese media reported on the fire late in the evening, many hours after it had been extinguished, in an apparent reflection of the authorities' sensitivity about public anger over the grim news.",在去年解除实行近三年的严厉防疫措施后，中国出现了有时致命的新冠感染浪潮，这场火灾对逐步恢复正常的首都北京是一个打击。中国官方媒体在晚间对大火进行了报道，此时距离大火扑灭已经过了数小时，从中似乎可以看到当局对这一可怕消息或将引发公愤的敏感。
"Yin Li, the Communist Party secretary for Beijing, visited the site of the fire and said that the authorities would pursue whoever was found culpable, the Beijing Daily reported.",据《北京日报》报道，北京市委书记尹力视察了火灾现场，并表示当局将追究相关责任人责任。
"""This fire is heart-rending, and its lessons are utterly profound,"" said Mr. Yin, who as party secretary outranks the mayor. ""This is a warning bell for us, reminding us that there cannot be the least slackening in work safety.""","""这次火灾令人痛心，教训极其深刻，""作为党委书记的尹力地位高于市长。""为我们敲响警钟，提醒我们安全生产这根弦须臾不能松，消除火灾隐患一刻不能停。"""
"In November, an apartment fire in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang region in western China, killed 10 people and prompted protests across China, where many blamed the deaths on pandemic restrictions that impeded residents and firefighters.",去年11月，中国新疆地区首府乌鲁木齐发生公寓大火，造成10人死亡，引发了中国各地的抗议活动，许多人将死亡归咎于阻碍居民和消防员行动的防疫措施。
"On Chinese social media platforms, such as Weibo, residents shared pictures and snippets of footage that showed how the fire in Beijing engulfed much of the building, leaving many inside with no time or avenues of quick escape.",在微博等中国社交媒体平台上，民众分享了照片和短视频，从中可以看到北京的这场大火吞没了住院楼的大部分区域，让许多人没有时间或途径快速逃生。
"Smoke billowed from the windows, while people inside shouted for help, some leaning out of windows. Other footage showed a man climbing out of a window, down some blankets and dropping onto nearby roof. A picture showed the white-tiled exterior of the hospital building heavily charred by the flames and smoke.",浓烟从窗户翻滚而出，里面的人大声呼救，有些人探出窗外。另一个视频显示一名男子爬出窗户，顺着毯子落到附近的屋顶上。一张照片显示，医院大楼的白色瓷砖外墙被火焰和浓烟严重烧焦。
Messages that shared the footage on social media platforms often quickly disappeared after they were issued. The Chinese government has become adept at swiftly censoring news in an effort to to quell public anger and questions about disasters. Some on social media asked why it took so long for the Beijing government to release news of the fire.,在社交媒体平台上分享视频的帖子在发布后通常很快消失。中国政府在迅速审查新闻以平息公众的愤怒和对灾难的质疑这方面已经非常熟练。社交媒体上有人问，为什么北京政府过了这么长时间才发布火灾消息。
"""Even if this had not happened in the capital, shouldn't the public have a basic right to know about a fire disaster that killed 21 people,"" said one comment on WeChat, a Chinese social media service.","""即使这没有发生在首都，公众不应该有基本的权利了解一场导致21人死亡的火灾吗，""微信上的一则评论说。"
"After two decades on loan to the Memphis Zoo, Ya Ya, a female giant panda, is heading home to China. To some animal welfare activists and Chinese people, it's not a moment too soon.",在被租借到孟菲斯动物园20年后，雌性大熊猫丫丫要回家了。对于一些动物福利活动人士和中国人来说，这一刻已是姗姗来迟。
"They are alarmed by videos and photos of Ya Ya in which she has mangy fur and looks somewhat thin. Two animal rights groups, In Defense of Animals and Panda Voices, have been campaigning to send her back to China ""before her health worsens."" They have also blamed the zoo for the death of Ya Ya's mate, Le Le, in February.","看到丫丫的视频和照片，他们很担忧，照片中她的皮毛脏兮兮的，看起来有些消瘦。两个动物权利组织——保卫动物组织和熊猫之声——一直呼吁，""在她的健康恶化之前""将其送回国。他们还将丫丫的伴侣乐乐在2月的死亡归咎于动物园。"
"The zoo strongly denies mistreating either panda, and it has issued a joint statement withChinese officials explaining Ya Ya's health issues. But the campaign has resonated on Chinese social media. Outraged users have analyzed the zoo's ""panda cam"" videos in minute detail, looking for signs of abuse, and some have gone so far as to question China's decades-old practice of using pandas as a tool for diplomacy.","动物园强烈否认虐待这两只熊猫，并与中国官员发表联合声明，解释丫丫的健康问题。但这件事在中国的社交媒体上引起了强烈反响。愤怒的用户详细分析了动物园的""熊猫摄像头""视频，寻找虐待的迹象，有些人甚至质疑中国几十年来将熊猫作为外交工具的做法。"
"A Chinese student in New York, Hugo Zhang, said he became so concerned about Ya Ya's welfare that he flew to Memphis during his spring break to see her in person.",纽约的中国留学生雨果·张说，他非常担心丫丫的安危，所以在春假期间，他飞到孟菲斯亲自看望她。
"""She was in bad shape physically, and appeared to be seriously suffering from skin disease,"" Mr. Zhang said by telephone. He saidthe bamboo she was being fed didn't look fresh to him.","""她的身体状况很差，而且似乎患有严重的皮肤病，""张先生在电话中说。他还说，她吃的竹子在他看来也不够新鲜。"
"China has engaged in ""panda diplomacy"" since 1972, when its leader Mao Zedong promised two of the animals to President Richard M. Nixon. In 1984, China the only country where pandas can be found in the wild finalized an arrangement in which they would be sent to overseas zoos for 10 years at a time.","中国从1972年开始""熊猫外交""，当时中国领导人毛泽东向尼克松总统许诺赠送两只熊猫。1984年，中国(唯一在野外有大熊猫存活的国家)敲定了一项安排，以10年为期将大熊猫送往海外的动物园。"
"Eighteen countries now have pandas on loan from China; they arrive in pairs, inevitably with great fanfare. Analysts say China uses them to project a friendly image and to reward countries it's pleased with. (When President Emmanuel Macron of France visited China last week, a French zoo director was in his delegation; on Tuesday, French and Chinese media reported that two pandas at the ZooParc de Beauval, Huan Huan and Yuan Zai,would have their stay extended through 2027.)","现在有18个国家从中国租借大熊猫;它们成对到达，不可避免地引发轰动。分析人士说，中国利用它们来塑造友好形象，并奖励让中国感到满意的国家。(法国总统马克龙上周访华时，代表团中有一位法国动物园园长;周二，法国和中国媒体报道称，博瓦勒动物园的两只大熊猫""欢欢""和""圆仔""的租期将延长至2027年。)"
"Matthew Fraser, an associate professor at the American University of Paris specializing in soft power and geopolitics, said that Beijing uses pandas to leverage its interests with trading partners. While politics are rarely cited explicitly when pandas are returned, he added, such gestures are often full of symbolic meaning, since the species is native only to China and inevitably become star attractions and main revenue drivers at zoos.",巴黎美国大学专攻软实力和地缘政治的副教授马修·弗雷泽表示，北京利用熊猫从贸易伙伴那里谋求利益。他还说，虽然在归还大熊猫的时候很少明确提及政治，但这种姿态往往充满了象征意义，因为这种动物是中国独有，而且必定会成为动物园的明星和主要收入来源。
"""Almost always when China gives a panda to a zoo in another country, it is usually facilitating some kind of good will and very frequently a trade deal,"" he said in a phone interview. ""When China takes back a panda, it's usually because the regime is very displeased for some reason.""","""几乎每次中国将一只大熊猫送给另一个国家的动物园时，通常都是在示好，往往是为了达成贸易协议，""他在接受电话采访时说。""当中国收回一只大熊猫时，通常是因为当局出于某种原因感到非常不高兴。"""
"Ya Ya, who turns 24 this month, is at the end of her second 10-year stint at the zoo, having arrived in Memphis with Le Le in 2003. On Tuesday,Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said a Chinese expert and two employees of the Beijing Zoo were working with the Memphis Zoo to prepare for Ya Ya's relocation.",本月满24岁的丫丫即将结束她在孟菲斯动物园的第二个10年。2003年，它与乐乐一起来到这里。周二，中国外交部发言人汪文斌表示，北京动物园的一名中国专家和两名工作人员正在与孟菲斯动物园合作，为转移丫丫做准备。
"""The overall condition of the giant panda is relatively stable except for the fur condition caused by skin disease,"" Mr. Wang said. ""The Chinese side has already made preparations to welcome Ya Ya home.""","""除皮肤病导致的毛发脱落外，整体状态相对平稳，""汪文斌说。""中方现已做好接返大熊猫丫丫回国的各项准备。"""
"Rebecca Winchester, a spokeswoman for the Memphis Zoo, said the zoo had regularly provided Chinese officials with data about Ya Ya's health. She said the panda had a genetic condition that affected her immune system and made her fur look patchy. And at 190 pounds, she said, Ya Ya is naturally on the smaller side.",孟菲斯动物园发言人丽贝卡·温彻斯特说，动物园一直定期向中国官员提供丫丫的健康数据。她说，这只熊猫的遗传病影响了她的免疫系统，使她的皮毛看起来不好。而86公斤的丫丫本身就属于身材偏小。
"When Ya Ya paces in her enclosure another detail that alarmed people on social media she is likely exhibiting the hormonal influence of estrus, which female pandas undergo once a year, Ms. Winchester said.",丫丫在它的围栏里踱来踱去是另一个在社交媒体上引起人们警觉的细节，温彻斯特说，当时这很可能是它受到发情期的荷尔蒙影响的表现，雌性大熊猫每年都会经历一次发情期。
"""It is heartbreaking to have an entire narrative out there,"" Ms. Winchester said when asked about the criticism. ""First of all it is hard to control. You don't speak the same language, and it is not easy to travel to Memphis and see her with their eyes.""","""外面有一套完全不同的说法，这令人心碎，""当被问及批评时，温彻斯特说。""首先，这很难控制。你们说的不是同一种语言，而且来孟菲斯亲眼见到它并非易事。"""
"Some of the zoo's critics were apparently opposed to animal captivity in general. ""CLOSE ALL ZOOS!"" one wrote on the zoo's Facebook page.","动物园的一些批评者显然是在总体上反对圈养动物。""关闭所有动物园!""一名用户在动物园的Facebook页面上写道。"
"In areport last year, published in response to concerns on social media, the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens said that when Ya Ya first arrived in Memphis, experts suspected that she had mites, from which her mother had also suffered, and for which Ya Ya had undergone treatments with mixed results. The report also said she had lost weight since experiencing a ""phantom pregnancy"" in 2021.","去年，中国动物园协会针对社交媒体上的担忧发布了一份报告，称丫丫刚到孟菲斯时，专家就怀疑它有螨虫，它的母亲也患有螨虫性皮肤病，因此丫丫接受了治疗，结果好坏参半。报道还称，自从2021年经历""假孕""后，她的体重有所下降。"
"In December, the zoo and the Chinese association announced that Ya Ya and Le Le would return to China in the spring. But Le Le died two months later, at 24. Another joint statement said he had likely died from heart disease. (Wild pandas have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years, while captive pandas typically live for about 30 years.)",12月，孟菲斯动物园和中国动物园协会宣布，丫丫和乐乐将于春季回国。但乐乐在两个月后去世，终年24岁。另一份联合声明称，他很可能死于心脏病。(野生大熊猫的预期寿命为15至20岁，而圈养大熊猫的寿命通常为30岁左右。)
"Chinese fans were glad she was coming home, and some said she should never have left. A video blogger who uses the nickname Yue Yue visited the panda enclosure; calling out in the dialect of giant pandas' native province, Sichuan, she told Ya Ya to eat more and that she'd be home soon.","中国粉丝很高兴它能回家，有些人说它原本就不该离开。昵称""悦悦""的视频博主参观了熊猫馆;她用四川方言喊丫丫多吃点，很快就到家了，四川是大熊猫的出生地。"
"No exact date has been set for Ya Ya's trip home, because a federal agency still needs to finalize a permit for her travel. But she was givenasend-offat the zoo last week,featuring speeches and performances from local Chinese organizations. Earlier, the zoo had filmed a less formal farewell, marching a goat, a tortoise, an aardvark, a sloth, a porcupine and a penguin up to Ya Ya's enclosure, where she nibbled on a stalk and presumably accepted their well wishes.",丫丫回家的确切日期尚未确定，因为联邦机构仍需要最终确定她的旅行许可。但动物园上周为它举办了欢送仪式，当地华人组织做了致辞和表演。早些时候，动物园拍摄了一段非正式的告别视频，一只山羊、一只乌龟、一只土豚、一只树懒、一只豪猪和一只企鹅来到了丫丫的场馆，它在那里啃着竹子，想必是接受了它们的祝福。
"By the usual measures, Loretta Liu had it made. She graduated in 2018 from one of China's top universities, rented an apartment in the glamorous city of Shenzhen, and had been hired as a visual designer at a series of high-flying companies, even as youth unemployment in China was reaching record highs.",按照通常的衡量标准，洛丽泰·刘(音)获得了成功。她于2018年从中国一所顶尖大学毕业后，在令人向往的深圳租了一套公寓，并先后被一系列十分成功的公司聘为视觉设计师，即使是在中国年轻人失业率创下历史新高之际。
"Then, last year, she quit. She now works as a groomer at a chain pet store, for one-fifth of her previous salary. She spends hours on her feet, wearing a uniform in place of her once carefully selected outfits.",然后，她去年辞了职。她如今在一家连锁宠物店做美容师，薪水是以前的五分之一。新工作需要长时间站立，而且得穿制服，而不像过去身着精心挑选的衣服。
And she is delighted.,她很开心。
"""I was tired of living like that. I didn't feel like I was getting anything from the work,"" Ms. Liu said of her previous job, where she said she had little creative freedom, often worked overtime, and felt her mental and physical health deteriorating. ""So I thought, there's no need anymore.""","""就是厌倦吧。厌倦那样的生活。我没有从这个工作当中感受到我有在进步，我有什么累积，""刘女士谈到以前的工作时说，她说自己几乎没有创作自由，还要经常加班，她感觉自己的身心健康状况每况愈下。""所以我当时觉得，没有太大必要了。"""
"Ms. Liu is part of a phenomenon attracting growing attention in China: young people trading high-pressure, prestigious white-collar jobs for manual labor. The scale of the trend is hard to measure, but widely shared social media posts have documented a tech worker becoming a grocery store cashier; an accountant peddling street sausages; a content manager delivering takeout. On Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like app, the hashtag ""My first experience with physical labor"" has more than 28 million views.","一种现象正在中国引起越来越多的关注，刘女士正是其中的一员:年轻人辞掉压力大、地位高的白领工作，选择去干体力活。虽然这个趋势的规模难以衡量，但社交媒体上大量转发的帖子提到了一名技术人员转行去当杂货店收银员，一名会计师转行去街头叫卖香肠，还有一名网站内容管理员转行去送外卖。在类似于Instagram的手机应用小红书上，""#我的体力活初体验""标签的浏览量已超过2800万。"
"Proponents describe the joy of predictable hours and a less competitive atmosphere. They acknowledge that the change requires sacrifices Ms. Liu said she saved about $15,000 before quitting and has cut her spending dramatically but say that they are worth escaping the spiritual draining of their former jobs. Ms. Liu said she much preferred the physical exhaustion of wrestling with uncooperative dogs to the mental toll of poring over design assignments she had not chosen. Many also say they are looking for light physical labor, not intensive work like construction or factory jobs.",这个趋势的支持者提到有规律的工作时间和竞争不那么激烈的环境带给人的快乐。他们承认改行需要做出牺牲——刘女士说她存了大约10万元才辞职，并在辞职后大幅削减了日常开支——但他们说，转行让他们摆脱了以前工作带来的心力憔悴，所以是值得的。刘女士说，她宁愿照料不合作的狗导致的体力消耗，而不要费力地去弄那些不由她选择的设计任务带来的精神损害。许多人还说，他们正在寻找的是轻体力劳动，而不是像建筑工地或工厂工作那样的高强度劳动。
"Around the world, the coronavirus pandemic spurred people to reassess the value of their work see the ""Great Resignation"" in the United States. But in China, the forces fueling the disillusionment of young people are particularly intense. Long working hours and domineering managers are common. The economy is slowing, dimming the prospect of upward mobility for a generation that has known only explosive growth.","在世界各地，新冠病毒大流行促使人们重新评估工作的价值，比如美国出现的""大辞职潮""。但在中国，助长年轻人幻灭感的力量尤为强烈。工作时间长和专横的上司很常见。经济正在放缓，让向上流动的前景变得黯淡，而这代人以前只知道爆炸式的经济增长。"
"And then there were China's three years of ""zero Covid"" restrictions, which forced many to endure prolonged lockdowns, layoffs and the realization of how little control their hard work gave them over their futures.","再就是中国执行了三年的""新冠清零""政策，它迫使许多人忍受长时间的封控和裁员，而且令他们意识到，辛勤工作并不能换来对未来的掌控。"
"""Emotionally, everyone probably can't bear it anymore, because during the pandemic we saw many unfair and strange things, like being locked up,"" Ms. Liu said.","""大家的情绪会有点受不了，疫情期间遭遇了很多不公平的待遇，觉得莫名其妙的被关起来。""刘女士说。"
"The job-changing trend has revived a debate about the futility of the rat race. Two years ago, a similar call to quit work and enjoy life, dubbed ""lying flat,"" spread widely online. Critics accused adherents of wasting their parents' investment and abandoning the industriousness that helped build China into a superpower. But others blamed a values system that had prioritized one, consumerist path to success, for their disenchantment.","换工作的趋势重新引发了关于激烈竞争是否徒劳无益的争论。两年前，网上广泛流传过被称为""躺平""的类似号召，意思是让人们辞去工作、享受生活。批评者指责那样做的人浪费了父母在他们身上的投入，放弃了帮助中国成为超级大国的勤奋努力。但其他人则将他们幻想破灭的原因归咎于一个优先考虑消费主义成功之路的价值体系。"
"Since then, competition for white-collar jobs has grown only more cutthroat. A record number of students are expected to graduate from universities this year, even as companies have cut back on hiring. The unemployment rate among people ages 16 to 24 was nearly 20 percent last summer, according to official statistics, with the rate higher among college graduates.",那之后，白领工作的竞争变得更加残酷。就在企业减少招聘人数之际，预计今年的大学毕业生人数将创下历史新高。据官方统计，16至24岁人群去年夏天的失业率接近20%，大学毕业生的失业率更高。
"So rather than trying even harder to compete, some find the traditionally less coveted route attractive.",所以有些人不愿意更努力地去竞争，而是发现传统上不那么令人垂涎的选择富有吸引力。
"""The purpose of studying and accumulating knowledge is not to land an impressive job, but to have the bravery to accept more possibilities,"" reads the description for one online forum, which invited its more than 39,000 members to ask how tiring setting up a street stall is, or to describe their experience waiting tables.","""我们读书，学习知识，不是为了做到什么了不起的职位，恰恰是有勇气去接受更多可能性吧，""一个网络论坛上的帖子这样写道，该论坛邀请其逾3.9万名成员提问题，比如在街头摆摊有多累，或描述他们当餐厅服务员的经历。"
"When Eunice Wang, 25, was offered a consulting job in Beijing last year after finishing her master's degree, she immediately accepted. She was proud of having stood out among so much competition, and she wanted to see how much further she could go.",现年25岁的尤妮斯·王(音)去年拿到了硕士学位，北京一家企业提供给她一份咨询工作，她立即接受了。她为自己在如此之多的竞争者中脱颖而出感到自豪，她想看看自己在职场上能走多远。
"But China's corporate culture is notoriously demanding, with employee deaths at internet companies prompting questions about overwork and mental health. Soon, Ms. Wang said, she fell into a vicious cycle: She developed anxiety from her heavy workload, but was too busy to decompress. She also had not seen her parents in nearly a year, because of Covid travel restrictions.","但中国的企业文化是出了名的苛刻，互联网公司员工的突然死亡曾引发人们对造成过度劳累、影响心理健康的工作的质疑。王女士说，开始工作后不久，她陷入了一种恶性循环:繁重的工作让人焦虑，但又忙得无暇减压。由于""新冠清零""限制了旅行，她已有将近一年没与父母见面了。"
"Last fall, she quit. She now works at a coffee shop in her hometown Shenyang, in northeastern China, making one-fifth of her previous salary. She is living with her parents and earning extra money through freelance illustrating, a hobby she'd given up in Beijing.",去年秋天，她辞了职。她目前在东北老家沈阳的一家咖啡店工作，收入是以前的五分之一。她住在父母家，并担任自由插画师挣点外快，画画是她在北京时放弃的爱好。
"Ms. Wang, who described her family as comfortably middle class, acknowledged that she was lucky she could afford such a choice. She would return to white-collar work if her parents one day needed financial support, she said. But until then, she valued the opportunity to challenge her long-held notions of success.",王女士将自己的家庭描述为丰衣足食的中产阶级，她承认自己很幸运，能够负担得起这种选择。她说，如果有那么一天，她需要在经济上支持父母的话，她会重返白领工作。但在那之前，她珍惜有机会挑战她长期以来持有的成功观念。
"""Everyone thought that conquering a project or securing a client was such a great thing, and I wanted to force myself to believe the same,"" she said of her former job. But she discovered that she found enough gratification in befriending a customer, or being praised for a well-made latte. ""I don't need other people to tell me what my future will hold.""","""他们会觉得我把这个项目给攻克下来，我把这个客户给搞定，会是一件很了不起的事，我当时就很想逼迫自己能这么想，""她谈到以前的工作时说。但她发现，与顾客交朋友，或因制作了一杯很棒的拿铁咖啡受到称赞时，她找到了足够的满足感。""不用别人告诉我，我的发展方向是啥。"""
Those who have made the change are likely still a tiny minority. Many who have posted in online forums are asking questions rather than jumping in. Some who left their higher-earning positions acknowledge that they do not know how long they will stay in their new occupations; some say they are now spending more than they earn.,做出这种变化的人可能仍是极少数。网络论坛上发帖的许多人是在问问题，而不是已经转行的那些。一些离开了高收入职位的人承认，他们不知道自己能在新职业上坚持多久;有人说他们现在花的钱比挣的多。
"Online critics have slammed the job switchers as naive, suggesting that they are playacting at poverty or taking blue-collar jobs from less educated people who need them.",网上的批评者抨击改行的人天真，暗示他们是在假装贫穷，或抢了需要这种工作的人的饭碗，那些人因为受教育程度较低只能从事蓝领工作。
"But criticism has also flowed in the opposite direction: China's state broadcaster recently blamed the unemployment problem in part on young, educated Chinese being too unwilling to take on blue-collar work, suggesting that they were spoiled.",但也有相反的批评:中国的国家电视台最近将失业问题部分归咎于受过高等教育的中国年轻人太不愿意从事蓝领工作，暗示他们被宠坏了。
"Social media users responded furiously, pointing out that society had long prized education above all else and, especially since China's economic reform began, cast manual labor as something to be shaken off.",社交媒体用户对这个说法的反应激烈，他们指出社会长期以来将教育看得高于一切，尤其是在中国开始进行经济改革以来，体力劳动被视为是需要摆脱的东西。
"The problem was not that young people thought they were too good for that work, but that it did not offer a real chance at a better life, because of lower wages and persistent discrimination, said Nie Riming, a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Finance and Law. Until China offered better-paid blue-collar jobs and accorded them most respect, young people were being pragmatic, not picky.",上海金融与法律研究院研究员聂日明表示，问题不在于年轻人认为体力活不值得他们干，而是因为低工资和持续存在的歧视让体力劳动没有给人提供过上更好生活的真正机会。年轻人这样的选择是出于务实而非挑剔。除非中国给蓝领工作提供更高的薪水，给予体力劳动者更多的尊重。
"""If society isn't diverse, it's impossible to expect students to make diverse choices,"" he said.","""你不是一个多元化社会，但是你希望让学生的选择是多元的，但这个是不可能的，""他说。"
"Even some of the young Chinese praising their new, less prestigious jobs had not initially planned to take them.",就连一些夸耀自己在平凡领域新工作的中国年轻人最初也没有打算接受那些工作。
"When Yolanda Jiang, 24, resigned last summer from her architectural design job in Shenzhen, after being asked to work 30 days straight, she hoped to find another office job. It was only after three months of unsuccessful searching, her savings dwindling, that she took a job as a security guard in a university residential complex.",现年24岁的约兰达·江(音)去年夏天辞去了在深圳的建筑设计工作，之前她曾被要求连续工作30天。她希望再找一份白领工作。但找了三个月都没有成功，积蓄越来越少，她找到一份在大学宿舍当保安的工作。
"At first, she was embarrassed to tell her family or friends, but she grew to appreciate the role. Her 12-hour shifts, though long, were leisurely. She got off work on time. The job came with free dormitory housing. Her salary of about $870 a month was even about 20 percent higher than her take-home pay before a symptom of how the glut of college graduates has started to flatten wages for that group.",起初，她不好意思告诉家人或朋友，但后来她开始逐渐喜欢上这个角色。12小时轮班虽然很长，但也很悠闲。她准时下班。这份工作附带免费宿舍。她每月6000元的工资甚至比她以前实际得到的工资还要高出约20%，这说明大学毕业生过剩已开始压低该群体的工资。
"But Ms. Jiang said her ultimate goal is still to return to an office, where she hoped to find more intellectual challenges. She had been taking advantage of the slow pace at her security job to study English, which she hoped would help her land her next role, perhaps at a foreign trade company.",但江女士说，她的最终目标还是回到办公室上班，她希望办公室工作让她找到更多的脑力挑战。她一直在利用安保工作节奏缓慢的机会学习英语，希望这能帮助她找到下一份工作，也许是在一家外贸公司。
"""I'm not actually lying flat,"" Ms. Jiang said. ""I'm treating this as a time to rest, transition, learn, charge my batteries and think about the direction of my life.""","""做保安不算真的躺平，""江女士说。""因为我只是把它当成一个休息、过渡，歇脚休息(的地方)，(来)学习充电、思考人生方向。"""
"When the Chinese government announced last month that it would fully reopen its borders to foreign travelers, the news came as a jolt of relief to the millions of Chinese immigrants overseas who have been separated from their relatives since 2020.",上个月，中国政府宣布将向外国旅客全面开放边境，这个消息令数百万自2020年以来与亲人分离的海外中国移民松了一口气。
"But a flood of visitors has yet to arrive. Many people are struggling to even book a plane ticket, stymied by high prices and a lack of direct flights.",但大量人员入境的情况尚未出现。由于高昂的票价和缺乏直飞航班，许多人甚至连机票都订不上。
"Liu Wei, 62, who lives in San Diego, recently spent hours at a local travel agency filling out a pile of paperwork to obtain a long-term visa to China. After searching for weeks for a flight, she bought a ticket for later this month to reunite with her sisters in the northeastern port city of Dalian. Round-trip business-class tickets from San Diego to Dalian cost between $6,000 and $10,000, she said, double what she typically paid before the pandemic.",为了获得去往中国的长期签证，现年62岁、住在圣地亚哥的刘维(音)最近花了几个小时在当地一家旅行社填写一大堆文件。花费几周寻找航班后，她买了一张本月晚些时候飞往东北港口城市大连的机票，去和她的姐妹团聚。她说，从圣地亚哥到大连的往返商务舱机票价格在6000到1万美元之间，是大流行前她通常支付的两倍。
"""I miss the choice and the freedom to go back and forth,"" said Ms. Liu, who used to visit China every summer. ""It's been such a tragedy for us to not be able to go back to our own country.""","""我怀念往返两地的选择和自由，""刘维说。她过去每年夏天都来中国。""无法回到自己的国家对我们来说真是一场悲剧。"""
"For nearly three years, China maintained some of the harshest travel restrictions in the world, largely sealing off its borders to business travelers, tourists and relatives of Chinese nationals. The ruling Communist Party enforced a ""zero Covid"" policy, attempting to eradicate the coronavirus with prolonged lockdowns and mass testing.","近三年来，中国一直在执行世界上最严厉的旅行限制措施，在很大程度上对商务旅客、游客和中国公民的亲属关闭了边境。执政的共产党实施了""清零""政策，试图通过长期封锁和大规模核酸检测来根除新冠病毒。"
"Overseas visitors who did manage to enter China were sometimes forced to quarantine for up to two months at their own expense. Some travelers even had to undergo anal swab Covid testing, triggering protests from governments outside China.",设法进入中国的海外游客有时被迫自费隔离长达两个月。一些旅行者甚至不得不接受肛拭子核酸检测，引发了外国政府的抗议。
"China's isolation had broad ripple effects. Universities shut down academic exchanges with the mainland, and multinational companies shifted their supply chains to other countries. The millions of Chinese immigrants overseas in countries like the United States, Britain, Canada and Malaysia suffered the heaviest emotional cost, unable to return home to care for sick parents or bury relatives who died during the pandemic.",中国的隔离产生了广泛的连锁反应。大学关闭了与大陆的学术交流，跨国公司将供应链转移到其他国家。在美国、英国、加拿大和马来西亚等国家的数百万海外华人移民遭受了最沉重的情感代价，他们无法回家照顾生病的父母或安葬在大流行期间去世的亲人。
"In December, China abruptly ended its ""zero Covid"" policy and soon began to ease border restrictions, removing quarantine requirements for international arrivals. The following month, business travelers were allowed to return on special visas.","去年12月，中国突然终止了""清零""政策，并很快开始放宽边境限制，取消了对国际入境者的隔离要求。接下来的一个月，商务旅客获准持特殊签证返回。"

She was supposed to visit in early 2020 after he suffered a stroke.",住在新泽西州泽西市的杰西·黄希望今年夏天飞往中国，但一直买不到2000美元以下的机票。52岁的黄女士已经七年没有见过她86岁的父亲，他住在上海沿海的一个小岛上。她本应在2020年初探访，他在那之前经历了一次中风。
"Ms. Huang has kept in touch with him through WeChat, the Chinese messaging app. She sometimes feels heartbroken after their conversations, sensing that each passing year becomes harder for him.",黄女士一直通过微信与父亲保持联系。有时在他们谈话之后，她会感到心碎，感觉对他来说每过一年就变得愈发艰难。
"""I'm just missing my family,"" she said.","""我只是想念我的家人，""她说。"
"Prices have stayed high partly because airlines have been slow to ramp up their flights to China. Globally, the number of flights into China in March were only about a quarter of what they were in the same month in 2019, according to Cirium, an aviation data provider.",机票价格居高不下的部分原因是航空公司在增加飞往中国的航班方面进展缓慢。根据航空数据提供商Cirium的数据，在全球范围内，3月飞往中国的航班数量仅为2019年同月的四分之一左右。
"Routes between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, have been capped because of geopolitical tensions. During the pandemic, the two rivals suspended each other's flights in a political tit-for-tat, and airlines need the approval of both countries' aviation authorities to increase routes.",由于美国和中国的地缘政治紧张局势，这两个世界上最大的经济体之间的航线设置了上限。大流行期间，两个竞争对手暂停了对方的航班作为政治性报复，航空公司需要获得两国航空主管部门的批准才能增加航线。
"American and European carriers are not as eager to resume all of their prepandemic flights to China, aviation analysts say. Since invading Ukraine more than a year ago, Russia has banned the American and European carriers from flying through its airspace, meaning flights to China now require longer routes with more fuel and flight crew.",航空分析人士表示，美国和欧洲的航空公司并不急于恢复疫情前飞往中国的所有航班。自从一年多前入侵乌克兰以来，俄罗斯已经禁止美国和欧洲航空公司飞越其领空，这意味着飞往中国的航班现在需要更长的航线、更多的燃料和机组人员。
"U.S. carriers have been lobbying Washington to force Chinese airlines, which are still flying over Russia, to use the same routes as their American competitors, arguing that they have an unfair cost advantage.",美国航空公司一直在游说华盛顿迫使仍在俄罗斯上空飞行的中国航空公司使用与美国竞争对手相同的航线，理由是它们拥有不公平的成本优势。
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation did not provide comment on when routes to China might increase.,美国交通部发言人没有就何时可能增加中国航线发表评论。
"Direct flights between the United States and mainland China are hard to get. Last month, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both resumed direct flights to Shanghai from hubs in Detroit, Seattle and Dallas, but only a handful of times per week. United Airlines operates a direct flight from San Francisco to Shanghai four times a week. None of the airlines has any direct flights between the United States and Beijing.",很难买到美国和中国大陆之间的直飞航班机票。上个月，达美航空和美国航空都恢复了从底特律、西雅图和达拉斯的枢纽直飞上海的航班，但每周只有少数几个班次。联合航空公司每周有四次从旧金山直飞上海的航班。这些航空公司都没有美国和北京之间的直飞航班。
Aviation analysts say airlines are also hesitant to add flights when other hurdles are dampening the demand to fly into China.,航空分析人士表示，如今，其他障碍抑制了飞往中国的需求，航空公司也不愿增加航班。
"A negative P.C.R. test within 48 hours of departure is still mandatory for citizens of many countries to enter China. And the sudden changes in China's border policies have left consulates around the world struggling to handle paperwork for visas, which are required for all overseas travelers to and from China.",许多国家的公民要想进入中国仍然必须出示出境前48小时内的新冠病毒检测阴性结果。中国边境政策的突然变化使得世界各地的领事馆难以处理签证文件，而所有来往中国的海外游客都需要办理签证。
"Another factor that has slowed the rebound in flights into China is the fact that most of them before the pandemic were filled with Chinese tourists returning home. About 20 percent of Chinese passports expired during the pandemic, according to data from consulting firm McKinsey, resulting in lengthy waits for renewals that have delayed the recovery in outbound travel.",还有一个因素导致了中国航班复苏乏力:疫情之前，大部分航班载的都是回国的中国游客。咨询公司麦肯锡的数据显示，疫情期间，约20%的中国护照过期，导致续期需要等待很长时间，这推迟了出境旅行的反弹。
But the gates are gradually opening.,但大门正在逐渐打开。
"Bookings for group tours have surged for a holiday break in China in early May, according to Ctrip, a Chinese online travel agency. The top destinations included Thailand, Egypt and Switzerland, Ctrip said.",根据中国在线旅行社携程网的数据，5月初，中国假期团体游的预订量激增。携程表示，最受欢迎的目的地包括泰国、埃及和瑞士。
"For now, the visitors who can most afford to fly to China are business travelers, who have been filling up premium cabins into the mainland.",目前，最能负担得起飞往中国的旅行者是商务旅客，他们一直乘坐高级舱位前往中国大陆。
"China has rolled out the red carpet for foreign business officials, part of an effort to revive its economy after years of Covid lockdowns. Dozens of chief executives, including Tim Cook of Apple, flew to Beijing to attend last month's China Development Forum, where China's newly elected premier, Li Qiang, pledged that ""the door to China's opening will grow wider.""","中国为外国商企人士铺好了红毯，经历数年的新冠封锁之后，这是振兴经济工作的一部分。包括苹果公司的蒂姆·库克在内，数十名首席执行官飞到北京，参加上个月的中国发展高层论坛。中国新当选的总理李强在会上承诺，""中国开放的大门会越开越大""。"
Many executives are eager to visit with employees and suppliers for the first time since 2020.,许多高管都渴望自2020年以来首次拜访员工和供应商。
"A February survey of 43 American companies showed that 50 percent of chief executives planned to visit China in the first half of this year, according to the U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group in China.",根据中国贸易组织美中贸易全国委员会的数据，2月份对43家美国公司的调查显示，50%的首席执行官计划在今年上半年访问中国。
"""The Chinese government has sent some signals for support about private companies, but at the same time, it's a tense geopolitical environment,"" said Jack Kamensky, a senior director at the business council.","""中国政府发出了一些支持民营企业的信号，但与此同时，地缘政治环境很紧张，""委员会高级总监丁振飞(Jack Kamensky)说。"
Some business owners were more hopeful about China's reopening.,一些企业主则对中国的重新开放抱有更多期待。
"For over a decade, Keith Collea, a film technology entrepreneur, worked in China's budding film industry on movies like the 2014 action film ""The Monkey King."" His latest project, which involved providing visual effect equipment to Chinese amusement parks, was halted when he was shut out of the country during a trip to Los Angeles in 2020.",十多年来，电影技术企业家基斯·科利尔一直在中国新兴的电影行业工作，参与了2014年的动作片《西游记之大闹天宫》等电影的摄制。他的最新项目是为中国的游乐园提供视觉效果设备，但他在2020年前往洛杉矶后再也无法进入中国，该项目因此暂停。
"Now, Mr. Collea is planning a long-awaited return. He was confident his projects would resume once he reunited with his former investors and partners.",现在，科利尔正在计划期待已久的回归。他相信，一旦与以前的投资者和合作伙伴团聚，他的项目就会恢复。
"""Doing business in China is not something you can do over the phone from the United States,"" he said. ""You have to sit with people, you have to go to dinners, you have to drink a lot. You have to invest and grow relationships there.""","""在中国做生意不是你在美国打个电话就能办到的，""他说。""你必须和人们坐在一起，你必须参加饭局，你必须喝很多酒。你必须在那里投入和培养关系。"""
"BEIJING Two of China's most prominent human rights lawyers were sentenced on Monday to 14 years and 12 years in prison, some of the lengthiest such sentences in recent years and an indication of how the space for expression has evaporated under China's leader, Xi Jinping.",北京——周一，中国最著名的两名人权律师分别被判处14年和12年有期徒刑，这是近年来此类案件的最重判刑，表明在中国领导人习近平统治下，言论空间已不复存在。
"The lawyers, Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi, had been charged with subversion for promoting what they called a ""New Citizens Movement,"" which encouraged ordinary Chinese to exercise the rights such as free speech guaranteed by the country's Constitution, at least in theory. They had been detained after organizing a gathering of about 20 lawyers and activists in the seaside city of Xiamen in 2019, where they discussed their plans to work toward those goals, and about the future of the human rights movement in China broadly.","律师许志永和丁家喜因为推动其所谓的""新公民运动""被指控犯有颠覆国家政权罪，该运动鼓励普通中国人行使宪法至少在理论上保障的言论自由等权利。他们于2019年在海滨城市厦门组织了一个约有20名律师和活动人士参加的聚会后被拘留，会上他们讨论了如何实现上述目标的计划，以及中国维权运动的未来。"
"In his decade as China's top leader, Mr. Xi has worked, largely successfully, to crush any vestiges of dissent. He has targeted not only human rights activists but also business tycoons, intellectuals and members of the party elite, some of whom have been sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison. He has expanded online censorship and demanded loyalty from media outlets.",在担任中国最高领导人的第一个十年里，习近平基本上成功地压制了所剩无几的异见。他不仅打击维权活动人士，也打击商业大亨、知识分子和党内精英阶层的人物，其中一些人已被判处接近20年的有期徒刑。习近平还扩大了网络审查，并要求媒体对他保持忠诚。
"Human Rights Watch, the international advocacy group, denounced the latest sentences as ""cruelly farcical"" and called for the men's immediate release. Mr. Xu and Mr. Ding were tried in secret, and the sentences handed down by a court in eastern Shandong Province were not publicly announced, but were confirmed by Mr. Ding's wife, Luo Shengchun, who also goes by Sophie.","国际倡导组织人权观察谴责对许志永和丁家喜的定罪判刑""残酷、荒谬""，并呼吁立即释放他们。对他们的审判是在山东省东部一家法院闭门进行的，虽然没有公开宣判，但丁家喜的妻子罗胜春证实了判决。"
"The length of the sentences surpassed even the dire predictions of the men's family members and supporters. Mr. Xu had previously served four years in prison, and Mr. Ding three-and-a-half, also related to their work with the New Citizens Movement.",刑期甚至超出了家人和支持者最坏的预测。许志永以前曾被判处四年有期徒刑，丁家喜被判过三年半，也与他们的新公民运动工作有关。
"""Since it was a secret trial, we knew it wouldn't be light, but we didn't think it would be this heavy. Because everything they did was within the scope of free speech and what criminal law permits,"" said Ms. Luo, who lives in the United States. ""More than 10 years shows that this government has absolutely no ability for self-reflection or self-restraint anymore.""","""因为秘密庭审我们知道不会判得轻，但是也没想到这么重。因为他们所做的一切的都是言论自由范围内的事，都是刑法所允许的事，""现居美国的罗胜春说。""10年以上，我就觉得这个政府已经完全的疯了，没有任何的自我反省，自我约束力了。"""
"In statements shared by Ms. Luo, which she said the men had dictated before their trials last year, Mr. Xu and Mr. Ding expressed conviction in the rightness of their actions.",罗胜春向外界分享了许志永和丁家喜去年在开庭前发表的法庭陈述，他们深信自己的行为是正确的。
"""To love China is to work to make her better,"" Mr. Xu wrote. ""I'm proud to suffer for the sake of freedom, justice and love.""","""爱中国就要努力使她更美好，""许志永写道。 ""为自由、公义、爱，我以受苦为荣耀。"""
"Mr. Ding said he believed in China's nonviolent political transformation. ""No matter how many doubts, difficulties or setbacks I've encountered, or torture I've personally suffered, I will not change my steadfast convictions,"" he wrote.","丁家喜说他相信中国的非暴力政治转型。""面对很多质疑，遇到很多困难，遭受很多挫折，以及个人被酷刑折磨，都不会改变我坚守的理念，""他写道。"
"The story of the men's careers is the story, in miniature, of the rise and fall of civil society in China.",许志永和丁家喜的职业生涯是中国公民社会兴衰的缩影。
"Mr. Xu, 50, has spent decades as one of the country's best-known advocates for civil liberties. A former law lecturer in Beijing, he shot to prominence in the early 2000s for helping encourage the authorities to abolish a detention system used against migrant workers without proper documentation. In the more politically open environment of the time, he became a hero, even appearing on the cover of the Chinese edition of Esquire magazine.",现年50岁的许志永几十年来一直是中国最著名的公民自由倡导者之一。他曾在北京一所大学任法学讲师，本世纪初，他曾参与促使当局废除针对没有合法证件的农民工的收容遣送制度，因此而步入公众视野。在当时更开放的政治环境下，他成了一名英雄，甚至登上了《时尚先生》(《Esquire》杂志中文版)的封面。
"In the years that followed, he called for government officials to disclose their wealth, represented death row inmates and pushed for rural migrant workers' children to have the same educational opportunities as those from cities.",在之后的几年里，他曾呼吁政府官员公布财产，为死刑犯担任辩护律师，努力让农民工子女享有与城市子女同等的教育机会。
"Mr. Ding, 55, was an engineer before he became a commercial lawyer. He joined Mr. Xu in promoting the New Citizens Movement in 2012 and was key to the groundwork of the cause, helping organize small street demonstrations in Beijing.",现年55岁的丁家喜曾是一名工程师，后来成了一名成功的商业律师。他在2012年与许志永一起加入到新公民运动中来，做了为这项事业打基础的关键工作，曾帮助组织北京街头的小型示威活动。
"Mr. Xi's rise to power in 2012 as China's top leader heralded a dramatic shrinking in the space for criticism. He moved quickly to eliminate perceived threats to the regime's authority, or his own, targeting political rivals and grass roots critics alike.",习近平在2012年担任中国最高领导人，预示着批评空间的大幅缩小。他迅速采取行动，消除了在他看来对中共或他本人的权威构成威胁的人，将政治对手和草根批评者作为打击对象。
Mr. Xu was the first high-profile activist to be prosecuted after Mr. Xi's ascent and was sentenced to four years in prison. Mr. Ding was sentenced shortly afterward.,许志永是习近平上台后第一个遭到起诉的知名活动人士，当时被判处四年有期徒刑。丁家喜不久后也获刑。
"After the men were released from prison, they continued to speak out, and to organize gatherings like the one in Xiamen in 2019, though public protests had become increasingly risky. Then, weeks after the Xiamen meeting, Mr. Ding was arrested. Mr. Xu evaded detection at first even writing an open letter from hiding that urged Mr. Xi to step down but was arrested in 2020.",他们出狱后继续公开发声，还组织了像2019年在厦门举行的那种聚会，尽管公开抗议的风险已变得越来越大。后来，丁家喜在厦门聚会的几周后被捕。许志永最初躲过了逮捕，甚至还在藏身处写了一封公开信，呼吁习近平下台。但他在2020年被抓。
"The authorities, in laying out the charges against the two men, described a litany of offenses over the past several years, including ""developing so-called 'citizen community groups,'"" and calling for ""equal access to education."" Mr. Ding was also sentenced to three years of deprivation of political rights after his release, Ms. Luo said, which can entail further detention and surveillance.","当局对两人提出指控时列举了他们在过去几年的一系列违法行为，包括""发展所谓的'公民社群'""，呼吁""教育平权""。丁家喜的判决还包括服满刑期后剥夺政治权利三年，罗胜春说，这可能意味着进一步拘留和监视。"
"Teng Biao, a lawyer and friend of Mr. Xu and Mr. Ding, said Monday's sentences showed how rapidly human rights had deteriorated under Mr. Xi. Mr. Teng, who left China in 2013 after being detained himself several times, said that under Mr. Xi's predecessors, it was ""not possible to imagine"" that a small-scale private gathering like the one in Xiamen could lead to such lengthy sentences.","滕彪律师是许志永和丁家喜的朋友。他表示，周一的判决表明，中国人权状况在习近平的统治下迅速恶化。滕彪本人也曾多次被拘留，后于2013年离开中国。他说，在习近平前任们当政的时代，""无法想象""像厦门那样的小型私人聚会会导致如此长的刑期。"
"But Mr. Teng noted the repression of Uyghurs in the far western region of Xinjiang, and the life sentence handed down to Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur activist and academic, under Mr. Xi. ""They don't care about human rights or the Constitution or international human rights standards,"" he said of the government.","但腾彪提到了习近平上台后在西部新疆地区镇压维吾尔族、判处维吾尔活动人士和学者伊力哈木·土赫提无期徒刑的情况。""他们无视人权、无视宪法、无视国际人权标准，""他指的是中国政府。"
"Several other lawyers and activists from the Xiamen gathering were also detained. Mr. Xu's girlfriend, Li Qiaochu, who was not at the gathering but had spoken on Mr. Xu's behalf after his detention, is also awaiting trial.",参加了厦门聚会的其他几名律师和维权人士也已被拘留。许志永的女友李翘楚也在候审中，虽然她没有参加聚会，但在许志永被拘留后曾代表许志永讲话。
"Yaqiu Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said she was personally pained by the sentences, noting that she had looked up to Mr. Xu as a college student in China in the late 2000s. The admiration he elicited was apparent when he was first tried and sentenced in 2014, when foreign diplomats and ordinary citizens gathered outside the Beijing courthouse, despite police intimidation, in protest.",人权观察中国高级研究员王亚秋说，这些判决对她个人来说很痛苦，她提到自己在2000年代后半程在中国上大学时非常仰慕许志永。许志永在2014年首次在法院接受审理并被判刑时，人们对他的钦佩显而易见，外国的外交官和中国的普通老百姓不顾警察的恐吓，在北京聚集在审理该案的法院大楼外以示抗议。
"Nine years later, heightened surveillance make such organization nearly impossible, and many of the lawyers' supporters have themselves been jailed or forced into exile, Ms. Wang said. And censorship had dimmed Mr. Xu's public profile.",九年后，监视的加强已让这种组织起来的行动变得几乎不可能，许志永和丁家喜的许多支持者自己也被关进了监狱或被迫流亡海外，王亚秋表示。审查制度也减少了公众对许志永的了解。
"""Now, it's an entirely different era,"" she said. ""Young people, college students now have no idea who Xu Zhiyong is.""","""现在是一个完全不同的时代，""她说。""年轻人、大学生现在都不知道许志永是谁了。"""
"A Chinese court on Friday sentenced six people to prison for human trafficking and abuse of a woman found chained to a wall in a shack last year, in a case that has provoked public outrage, dealt a blow to government credibility, and reopened debate about the status of women in China.",周五，中国一法院以拐卖妇女和虐待罪对六人判处有期徒刑，该案中，一名受到虐待的女子去年被人发现拴在一间破屋的墙上。此案激起公愤，打击了政府公信力，再次引发了国内关于妇女地位的辩论。
"Many questions remain about the woman and her situation, in part because the government has offered conflicting explanations and censored many people raising doubts about the official narrative. In announcing the jail sentences, the authorities may have hoped to end the discussion.",关于这名女子及其处境仍然存在诸多疑问，这在一定程度上是因为政府给出了自相矛盾的说法，并就许多人针对官方说法的质疑进行审查。通过宣判，当局可能希望结束这场讨论。
"But the punishments, ranging from eight to 13 years, only revived public fury. On Chinese social media, where multiple hashtags related to the case quickly topped the list of trending topics, commenters criticized them as too lenient, particularly the sentence of Dong Zhimin, the man who officials said had purchased the woman and fathered eight children with her. He was given nine years.",然而，从八年到13年不等的刑期却再次激起公愤。在中国社交媒体上，与此案相关的多个话题标签迅速登上热搜榜首，评论者批评这些判决太轻，尤其是对董志民的判决，官方称他买下了这名女子，并与她育有八个孩子。他被判九年。
"""Only nine years?"" read many comments under a state media post about the case; some noted that the sentence was not even enough time to give birth to eight children. The comments were ""liked"" more than 10,000 times on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, before being censored less than an hour later.","许多人在官方媒体关于此案的帖子下方评论道:""才九年?""一些人说，这样的刑期甚至不够用来生八个孩子。这些评论在微博上被""点赞""超过1万次，不到一个小时后就被屏蔽了。"
"Users also demanded to know where the woman was and how she was doing. She has not been seen publicly in more than a year, since shortly after the video of her chained in the shack surfaced on social media.",微博用户还要求知道这名女子现在在哪里、过得怎么样。自从她被锁在破屋子里的视频在社交媒体上曝光后不久，她已经一年多没有出现在公众视野中了。
"The case, one of the most hotly discussed topics on Chinese social media in recent years, for many people encapsulated the near-impossibility of openly discussing sensitive social issues. As the government's account of the woman's plight shifted, some Chinese journalists and amateur sleuths had tried to piece together their own explanations, only to be censored or physically sent away. Even usually nationalist voices had called on the government to offer a clearer explanation.",此案是近年来中国社交媒体上最热的话题之一，对许多人来说，它概括了几乎不可能公开讨论的敏感社会问题。随着政府改变对该女子遭遇的说法，一些中国记者和业余侦探试图自己找出答案，结果却遭到审查或被赶走。甚至连平时宣扬民族主义的声音也呼吁政府提供更明确的解释。
"During other times of public dissatisfaction after a videotapedgang beating of women last summer, or during coronavirus lockdowns social media users have invoked the chained woman.",社交媒体用户在其他引发公愤的事件中也会提到这位铁链女，包括去年夏天一段女子遭群殴的视频传到网上后，或在新冠病毒封锁期间。
"""It has almost become a metaphor,"" Ting Guo, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies gender and politics, said of the woman's case. ""It reminds the ordinary people that we are in some way living under a chain of some sort.""","""这几乎成了一个隐喻，""香港中文大学研究性别与政治的助理教授郭婷谈到这名女子的案例时说。""它提醒普通人，我们在某种程度上生活在某种铁链之下。"""
"The video that brought the woman to the public's attention was posted in January 2022 on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, by a blogger in Xuzhou, a city in eastern Jiangsu Province.",2022年1月，江苏省东部城市徐州的一名博主在抖音上发布了铁链女的视频，引起了公众的关注。
"In the footage, a middle-aged woman stands in a doorless brick shack, looking dazed, and wearing no coat despite the season. A metal chain around her neck shackles her to the wall. Eight children, along with a man who said he was their father, live in a house next door.",视频中，一名中年女子站在一间没有门的砖房里，神情茫然，天气寒冷却没有穿外套。脖子上的金属链将她拴在墙上。八个孩子和一个自称是他们父亲的男人住在隔壁的房子里。
"As the video spread online, the local authorities initially said that the woman, who they said was surnamed Yang, had been diagnosed with mental illness and was not a victim of human trafficking. They did not mention any investigation of the man, who they said was her husband.",随着视频在网上传播，地方当局最初表示，这名杨姓女子被诊断出患有精神疾病，并非人口贩卖的受害者。他们说这名男子是他的丈夫，但没有提到对他进行了任何调查。
"Public anger and skepticism continued to mount, and officials issued four more versions of events.",公众的愤怒和怀疑继续升温，官方又发布了四个不同版本的说法。
"In the final one, which followed a provincial-level investigation, the authorities said the woman's real name was Xiaohuamei little flower plum in Chinese and that she had been smuggled to Jiangsu from southwest China in 1998. (Online doubts as to whether this is her true identity have also emerged and been censored.)",经过省政府调查后，最终的说法是，当局称这名女子的真名是小花梅，于1998年从中国西南地区被拐卖到江苏。(关于这是否是她的真实身份，网上也出现了质疑的声音，但遭到了审查。)
"The provincial report said Xiaohuamei was sold twice within a year, the second time to the family of Mr. Dong, the man living next door in the video, and gave birth to eight children in the years after. She had shown signs of mental illness even before being trafficked; after she was discovered last year, she was found to have schizophrenia and hospitalized, according to officials.",省政府的调查称，小花梅一年内被卖了两次，第二次卖给了董家、在视频中住在隔壁的董志民。随后几年她生了八个孩子。甚至在被拐卖之前，她就已经表现出精神疾病的迹象;据官员称，在去年被发现后，她被诊断出患有精神分裂症并住院治疗。
"Mr. Dong was convicted of abuse and illegal detention, according to a statement from a Xuzhou court that was shared by Chinese state media. (He was not charged with buying a trafficked woman, because the statute of limitations had lapsed, state media said.) The court said that he had tied Xiaohuamei up, often left her hungry and cold, denied her water and the use of electricity, and never sought treatment of her mental illness.",根据中国官方媒体转发的徐州法院的一份声明，董志民被判犯有虐待和非法拘禁罪。(官方媒体称，他未被指控收买被拐卖的妇女是因为诉讼时效已经过期。)法院称，他将小花梅捆绑起来，经常让她挨饿受冻，居住场所无水电，也从未寻求治疗她的精神疾病。
Five other people were sentenced for abduction and trafficking of women.,另有五人因绑架和拐卖妇女获刑。
"Soon after the sentences wereannounced, Xinhua, the state news agency, gave an account of an interview with a doctor at the hospital where the victim was being treated. The doctor said she had been undergoing psychological counseling and drug therapy, and that she could communicate simply with medical staff, according to Xinhua.",判决宣布后不久，国家通讯社新华社报道了对受害人接受治疗的医院一名医生的采访。据报道，医生说她一直在接受心理咨询和药物治疗，可以与医护人员进行简单的交流。
"The case drew attention not only because of its horrific nature, but also because it highlighted several longstanding issues in Chinese society. Human trafficking became a widespread problem after the Chinese Communist Party's one-child policy led families to abort female fetuses, causing a shortage of womenand demand for brides. Mental illness has long been viewed as shameful, and treatment resources are limited.",此案之所以引起关注，不仅是因为案件本身骇人听闻，还因为它凸显了中国社会长期存在的几个问题。在中共的独生子女政策导致家庭选择性堕胎后，女性短缺和对娶妻的需求导致拐卖人口成为一个普遍的问题。精神疾病长期以来引发病耻感，治疗资源有限。
"And protections for women in China, including against sexual assault and domestic abuse, remain weak. Feminist activism has been a target for Beijing, which is wary of any independent organizing.",中国对女性的保护仍然薄弱，包括使其免受性侵犯和家暴。女权运动一直是北京针对的目标，北京对任何独立的组织机构都持谨慎态度。
"China has tried to crack down on human trafficking in recent years. But to many observers, the Xuzhou case has exposed holes in both enforcement and how the crime is understood.",近年来，中国一直在努力打击人口贩卖。但对许多观察人士来说，徐州的案件暴露了执法的漏洞以及对犯罪的了解不足。
"On Friday, many online commenters, outraged about what they saw as too short a sentence, pointed out other cases that had prompted longer sentences: for example, a writer given more than 10 years in prison for writing and selling ""perverted"" gay erotic novels. They reminded officials that they had at first denied twice that the chained woman was a victim of trafficking.","周五，许多网评认为刑期太短，并对此感到愤怒，还指出了一些比这一判决刑期更长的案件:例如，一名作家因撰写和销售""变态""同性恋色情小说而被判10年以上有期徒刑。他们提醒官员们，他们起初否认(而且是两次否认)这名被锁链束缚的女子是人口拐卖的受害者。"
"In addition, officials had not mentioned other potential crimes against her, such as rape, said Huang Simin, a lawyer in mainland China who has worked on cases of gender violence. (The presiding judge in the case told Xinhua that Mr. Dong had ""continuously caused her to become pregnant regardless of her physical condition."")","此外，在中国大陆从事性暴力案件的律师黄思敏(音)说，官员们没有提到其他针对她的可能罪行，例如强奸。(该案审判长告诉新华社，董志民""不顾她身体状况致其连续怀孕生育""。)"
"Ms. Huang noted that the sentences were actually heavy compared to other trafficking cases in China. But that was because so many cases were never prosecuted or sentenced too lightly, without taking into consideration other related offenses, she said. She added that some women who have sought divorce after claiming they were trafficked have had their petitions rejected by the courts.",黄思敏指出，与中国其他拐卖案件相比，这些刑罚实际上很重。但是，她说，那是因为很多案件从未被起诉，或判刑过轻，没有考虑其他相关罪行。她还说，一些女子声称自己被拐卖后寻求离婚，她们的申请未获法院支持。
"""Dong Zhimin's more than 20 years of violence toward Xiaohuamei destroyed a person's normal life, but he needs to pay the price for only nine years,"" she said.","""董志民对小花梅实施了20多年的暴力，毁掉了一个人的正常生活，但他需要付出的代价只有九年，""她说。"
"Some commenters also criticized the government's focus on controlling the narrative around the chained-woman case, rather than addressing the root of the problem itself. Others asked about the whereabouts of two female activists who were detained after they tried to visit the woman last February.",一些评论还批评政府把力气放在控制围绕铁链女案件的叙述上，而不是解决问题本身的根源。还有人询问去年2月试图探望这名女子后被拘留的两名女性活动人士的下落。
"Censorship efforts surrounding the case continued on Friday. Despite the main hashtag associated with the sentences being viewed more than 580 million times on Weibo a few hours after their announcement, it soon disappeared from the top trending list. And five hours after the sentences were announced, the only comments under the state broadcaster's post about the sentences were those supportive of them.",围绕此案的言论审查在周五继续。在判决发布数小时后，与之相关的主要话题标签在微博上的浏览量超过5.8亿次，尽管如此，它们很快就从热搜榜单上消失了。在宣布判决五小时后，国家电视台的帖子下面只有支持判决的评论。
"When members of Congress grilled TikTok's chief executive last month on Capitol Hill, the app's supporters sprang to its defense online.",上月国会议员在国会山对TikTok的首席执行官进行质询时，该应用程序的支持者在网上为其辩护。
"The lawmakers were ""old, tech-illiterate,"" one said. ""Out of touch, paranoid and self-righteous,"" said another. The hourslong hearing ""destroyed the illusion that US leads in cyber era,"" read another post.","有人说，这些议员""老朽、技术盲""。还有人说他们""脱离现实、偏执、自以为是""。另一个帖子写道，长达数小时的听证会""摧毁了美国在网络时代领先的幻想""。"
These particular barbs did not come from TikTok's users 150 million and counting in the United States but from representatives of China's government.,具体到这些讽刺，它们不是来自TikTok的用户——该应用在美国有1.5亿用户且数量还在增加——而是来自为中国政府做事的人。
"In an information campaign primarily run on Twitter, Chinese officials and state media organizations widely mocked the United States in the days before and after the hearing, accusing lawmakers of hypocrisy and even xenophobia for targeting the popular app, according to a report released on Thursday by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan initiative from the German Marshall Fund.","德国马歇尔基金会旗下的无党派组织""保障民主联盟""周四发布的一份报告显示，在一场主要在Twitter上展开的宣传运动中，中国官员和官方媒体机构在听证会前后的几天里广泛嘲笑美国，指责议员们把矛头对准这款受欢迎的应用是虚伪的，甚至是仇外的。"
"TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance, has sought to assure American lawmakers that it is independent from China's influence, and that it has extensive plans for securing Americans' data and providing oversight of its content recommendations. Shou Chew, TikTok's chief executive, explicitly said at the House hearing that ByteDance was ""not owned or controlled by the Chinese government.""","由中国科技公司字节跳动拥有的TikTok一直试图向美国议员保证，它不受中国的影响，并有广泛的计划来保护美国人的数据，并对其内容推荐进行监督。TikTok首席执行官周受资在众议院听证会上明确表示，字节跳动""不归中国政府所有，也不受其控制""。"
"China's information push, however, showed just how deeply invested Beijing was in the company's fate. Just hours before Mr. Chew's testimony last month, China's Commerce Ministry said it opposed a sale of TikTok in a direct rebuke of the Biden administration, which is pushing a sale.",然而，中国的这种宣传行动表明，这家公司与北京休戚相关。就在周受资上月作证的几个小时前，中国商务部表示反对出售TikTok，这是对正在推动出售的拜登政府的直接谴责。
"Chinese officials ""clearly feel a stake in it,"" said Michael H. Posner, a former assistant secretary of state and now director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at the Stern School of Business at New York University.","前助理国务卿、现为纽约大学斯特恩商学院商业与人权中心主任的迈克尔·波斯纳说，中国官员""显然感到此事与他们利害攸关""。"
The report from the Alliance for Securing Democracy found that Twitter accounts from Chinese diplomats and state media outlets posted nearly 200 tweets about TikTok in the week around the congressional hearing on March 23. That compared with fewer than 150 posts in all of January and February.,保障民主联盟的报告发现，在3月23日国会听证会前后的一周内，中国外交官和官方媒体的Twitter帐户发布了近200条关于TikTok的推文。相比之下，今年1月和2月的帖子不到150个。
"Chinese state media accounts also ran more than 30 stories about TikTok in outlets like China Daily, the report said. The researchers said in an interview that they had found similar content on Facebook and YouTube.",报道称，中国官方媒体还在《中国日报》等媒体上发表了30多篇关于TikTok的报道。研究人员在接受采访时表示，他们在Facebook和YouTube上也发现了类似的内容。
"Asked about its support for TikTok, China's foreign ministry said it opposed American actions that violate market principles and rules under the World Trade Organization to target foreign companies. ""What the U.S. should do is to stop smearing and slandering, and provide a fair, just, open, and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies from all over the world,"" the statement said.","在被问及对TikTok的支持时，中国外交部表示，反对美国违反市场原则和世界贸易组织规定，针对外国公司的行动。声明称:""美方应当停止在数据安全问题上散布虚假信息，停止无理打压有关企业，为各国企业在美投资经营提供开放、公平、公正、非歧视的营商环境。"""
"China's effort has echoes of its defense of another Chinese company that has found itself in the cross hairs of American legal and political controversy: Huawei, the telecommunications giant, which the United States has identified as a potential national security threat.",中国的努力与它为另一家处于美国法律和政治争议焦点的中国公司——电信巨头华为——提供的防卫如出一辙。美国已认定华为是潜在的国家安全威胁。
"The scale and tone of China's criticism of the U.S. government have intensified, though, reflecting the sharp deterioration of relations between the two countries despite a halting effort last year by President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to reverse the decline.",尽管拜登总统和中国领导人习近平为扭转两国关系的恶化做出努力，试图遏止这一势头，然而中国对美国政府的批评在规模和语气上已经加强，反映了两国关系还在急剧恶化。
"""This is how the U.S. talks to the world,"" a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, wrote last month on Twitter, in English, with the hashtag #TikTokHearing.","""这就是美国与世界对话的方式，""中国外交部发言人华春莹上个月在Twitter上用英语写道，并加上了""#TikTokHearing""(#TikTok听证会)的标签。"
"Her post, which was retweeted more than 1,200 times, included a clip from TikTok showing Representative Kat Cammack, Republican of Florida, who during the hearing called the app ""an extension"" of the Communist Party of China. When Mr. Chew asked for a chance to respond, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington and the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said it was time to move on.","她的帖子被转发了1200多次，其中包括一段来自TikTok的视频，视频中佛罗里达州共和党众议员凯特·卡马克在听证会上称该应用是中国共产党的""延伸""。当周受资希望做出回应时，华盛顿州共和党众议员、众议院能源和商务委员会主席凯茜·麦克莫里斯·罗杰斯说，是时候继续下一个问题了。"
"""What I think is surprising is how direct the attacks against U.S. lawmakers were,"" said Etienne Soula, a research analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy who wrote the report with Lindsay Gorman. ""It's par for the course for them to go after the U.S. system in general, saying it's dysfunctional, that democracy doesn't work and that it's not a real democracy."" It is far less common, he added, to see ""very open insults.""","""我认为，令人惊讶的是，这些针对美国议员的攻击是如此直接，""与林赛·戈尔曼共同撰写这份报告的保障民主联盟研究分析师艾蒂安·苏拉说。""对他们来说，攻击整个美国制度是很正常的，说它功能失调，说民主不起作用，说它不是真正的民主。""他还说，""非常公开的侮辱""并不是那么常见。"
"Chinese officials, including diplomats around the globe, have become adept at using social media including platforms like Twitter and Facebook that are banned in China to spread their political views to an international audience. The latest campaign, however, sought to directly influence the political debate in the United States.",中国官员，包括世界各地的外交官，已经学会熟练地使用社交媒体——包括在中国被禁止的Twitter和Facebook等平台——向国际受众传播他们的政治观点。然而，最新的活动试图直接影响美国的政治辩论。
"Posts by officials and state media mocked the political process. At least one stoked speculation of a potential ""Gen Z rebellion"" if lawmakers or the administration succeeded in banning the app or forcing its sale, as the Biden administration had been proposing.","官员和官方媒体的帖子嘲笑了这一政治过程。至少有一个帖子煽动了一种推测，即如果议员或政府像拜登政府一直提议的那样，成功禁止或强制销售这款应用，是否有可能会发生""Z世代叛乱""。"
"""China is careful not to interfere with other countries' internal affairs or internal politics, so to have them weigh in so openly to encourage voters to riot it's outside the ordinary,"" Mr. Soula said.","""中国小心翼翼地不干涉其他国家的内部事务或内部政治，所以让他们如此公开地参与进来，煽动选民闹事——这是不正常的，""苏拉说。"
"Other posts compared tense photos of the roughly five-hour hearing with pictures of Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, who was visiting China around the same time and smiling and posing with locals.",还有一些帖子将这场大约五小时听证会的紧张场面与苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克的照片进行对比，库克几乎在同一时间访问中国，微笑着与当地人合影。
"""Isn't it clear which side supports free trade and which side is against it?"" said a post from the Twitter account of Global Times, a nationalist paper owned by the Communist Party.","""哪一方支持自由贸易，哪一方反对自由贸易，这难道还不清楚吗?""中共的民族主义报纸《环球时报》在Twitter上发帖称。"
"Still others sought to deflect attention from TikTok, asking why lawmakers were highlighting its risks to young people while ""doing nothing on gun-control legislation."" They also called the criticism of the app ""xenophobic."" (TikTok's chief operating officer has also said calls to ban the app are xenophobic.)","还有一些说法则是为了转移对TikTok的关注，质问议员为何只关注TikTok对年轻人的危害，却在""控枪立法上不作为""。他们还将对这款应用的批评称为""仇外""。(TikTok首席运营官也说禁用该应用的呼声是仇外主义。)"
"More recently, Chinese state media outlets have continued to push the campaign on their Twitter accounts, with China Daily posting an article on March 31 titled: ""US says China can spy with TikTok. It spies on world with Google.'""",中国官媒近来继续在Twitter帐号上推动这些宣传，《中国日报》于3月31日发表了一篇题为《美国边指责TikTok边用谷歌监视世界》的文章。
"On TikTok itself, many users also rallied behind the company and Mr. Chew, who has become an unexpected celebrity. The hashtag #TikTokBan has been viewed more than two billion times. Brooke Oberwetter, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said Mr. Chew's popularity on the platform had increased organically.","而在TikTok，许多用户也团结起来支持该公司和周受资，后者成了意料之外的红人。""#TikTok禁令""的话题浏览量已超过20亿次。该公司发言人布鲁克·奥伯韦特表示，周受资在该平台的人气增长并无异常。"
"The Alliance for Securing Democracy did not track Chinese propaganda on TikTok's service as part of the report. Several Chinese media outlets already have accounts on the app. Their accounts and videos are identified with labels that say ""China state-controlled media,"" and their profiles have fewer followers than they do on Twitter, suggesting that the latter remains the principal platform for China's global messaging.","保障民主联盟的报告并未追踪TikTok上的中国宣传运动。多家中国媒体都在该应用上拥有帐号。它们的帐号和视频都被打上了""中国官方媒体""的标签，关注者比在Twitter上要少，表明Twitter仍然是中国全球信息传播的主要平台。"
"""We label state-affiliated media so our community is clear if they are engaging with content that may be controlled or influenced by a government,"" Ms. Oberwetter said. ""This is an ongoing process, and we'll continue to review new accounts and add labels as and when they join the platform.""","""使用官方相关媒体的标签，是为了让我们的用户群能清楚了解自己是否接触了可能受政府控制或影响的内容，""奥伯韦特说。""这是一个仍在进行的过程，我们也将继续审查新帐号，并在其加入平台时添加标签。"""
"CGTN, the English-language channel of the Chinese state television network, posted a TikTok video on March 24 that featured defenses of the platform from some of the influencers the company flew to Washington to help defend it before the hearing.",3月24日，中国国家电视台的英文频道CGTN发布了一段TikTok视频，内容是一些网红为TikTok站台，该公司在听证会开始前资助这些人飞往华盛顿为该平台造势。
"""When it comes to hot-button topics involving autocratic actors, it can be difficult to tell the difference between organic arguments and arguments derived from autocratic propaganda, even in open, democratic information spaces,"" the Alliance for Securing Democracy said in its report. ""Should geopolitical debates occur on Chinese-owned social media platforms like TikTok going forward, it could become even more difficult to differentiate between organic arguments and propaganda.""","""对于涉及专制行为者的敏感问题，即使是在开放民主的信息场也很难区分真实观点和出自专制政治宣传的说法，""保障民主联盟在其报告中写道。""若将来TikTok等中国拥有的社交媒体平台出现地缘政治辩论，辨别真实观点和政治宣传可能会更加困难。"""
The potential to shape public opinion is one of the major security concerns that American intelligence officials have raised about TikTok.,美国情报官员对TikTok的一大安全担忧就是其影响公众舆论的潜在可能。
"""If there are 150 million U.S. users, and God knows how many in the rest of the world,"" Mr. Posner said, ""it's a platform for disinformation just waiting to be exercised.""","""如果(TikTok)美国用户都有1.5亿，天知道在全世界会有多少，""波斯纳说。""这就是一个蓄势待发的虚假信息平台。"""
"President Emmanuel Macron of France arrived in Beijing on Wednesday determined to carve out a distinct role for Europe that avoids America's confrontation with an assertive China, and convinced that there is a place for China in ending the war in Ukraine.",法国总统马克龙周三抵达北京，决意为欧洲开辟一条与中国打交道的不同途径，避开美国与坚定自信的中国的对抗，并且确信中国在结束乌克兰战争方面可以发挥作用。
"Battered at home by protests over his decision to raise the French retirement age, rebuffed in his repeated attempts to sway President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from pursuing a long war, Mr. Macron has turned to China as ""the sole country in the world capable of changing Moscow's calculus"" on Ukraine, in the words of one diplomatic official.","由于做出了提高法国退休年龄的决定，马克龙在国内遭到接连不断的抗议。他曾多次试图说服俄罗斯总统普京不要在乌克兰穷追不舍地打下去，但遭到了拒绝。现在，马克龙转向中国，用一名外交官员的话说，它是""世界上能改变莫斯科(在乌克兰问题上)算计的唯一国家""。"
"""Only China can have a game-changer effect,"" the official, who requested anonymity in line with French diplomatic practice, said. ""We know there will be no Chinese condemnation of Russia, but the president has worked enormously to see how, with China, we can be useful to the benefit of Ukrainians.""","""只有中国能起到改变战局的作用，""上述官员说，按照法国的外交惯例，这名官员要求不具名。""我们知道中国不会谴责俄罗斯，但在搞清楚我们能与中国一起，为乌克兰人的利益发挥什么有益作用方面，(马克龙)总统已做出巨大努力。"""
"What exactly Mr. Macron has in mind is not clear. China has never condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It has avoided use of the word ""war"" to describe the Russian assault. It has embraced a ""no-limits,"" anti-Western partnership with Moscow, cemented last month by President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia and the joint declaration of a ""new era"" freed of what the two countries see as American dominance.","尚不清楚马克龙心中有什么具体想法。中国从未谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，也一直避免用""战争""一词来描述它的侵犯行为。它欣然接受与莫斯科的反西方伙伴关系，两国之间的""无止境""友谊在国家主席习近平上个月访问俄罗斯时得到了加强，双方还发表联合声明，宣布两国关系是不受美国主宰的""新时代国际关系""。"
But the French leader likes to thread needles invisible to others. He appears to detect enough Chinese disquiet over Mr. Putin's war for diplomatic ingenuity.,但这位法国领导人喜欢另辟蹊径走出困境。他似乎察觉到中国对普京的战争已足够地忧虑，让他能在外交上有所独创。
"China, as Mr. Putin acknowledged in September, has expressed ""questions and concerns"" about the war. Unlike Mr. Putin, it is not interested in nuclear saber-rattling; and it has not closed the door on the suggestion last month from Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, that China could ""become a partner"" in the quest for a settlement.","正如普京去年9月承认的那样，中国已对俄乌战争表示了""疑问和担忧""。与普京不同，中国对核威胁没有兴趣;而且它也没有拒绝来自乌克兰总统泽连斯基的建议，后者上个月曾提出，中国也许能在寻求解决方案上""成为合作伙伴""。"
"The United States has been dismissive of any Chinese role in Ukrainian peacemaking. It waved away a vague 12-point Chinese plan put forward in February. But Mr. Macron spoke to President Biden on the eve of his departure to Beijing and the two leaders evoked ""their shared wish to involve China in accelerating an end to the war in Ukraine,"" a French presidential statement said.","美国一直对中国在和平解决乌克兰战争上的作用不屑一提，对它在2月份提出的12条含糊立场置之不理。但马克龙在启程前往北京的前夕与拜登总统通了电话，据法国总统府的声明，两位领导人指出""他们希望中国参与到加速结束乌克兰战争的共同愿望""。"
"Still, clear differences remain on approaches to China. Taking his own independent position holds a strong political appeal to Mr. Macron, for whom the development of Europe as a global power is a recurrent theme.",尽管如此，他们与中国接触的方式仍存在明显分歧。对马克龙来说，采取自己的独立立场具有强烈的政治吸引力，把欧洲发展为一个影响全球事务的力量是一个反复出现的主题。
"He has been critical of the Biden administration's tough line on China and believes any decoupling, or ""de-linking,"" is not good for Europe, given the vast economic interests at stake. The German auto industry depends overwhelmingly on the Chinese market; a possible deal with China for the sales of dozens of Europe's Airbus aircraft is under discussion.","马克龙对拜登政府的对华强硬政策一直持批评态度，认为任何脱钩或""脱离联系""对欧洲都没有好处，因为这关系到巨大的经济利益。德国的汽车业在很大程度上依赖中国市场;目前中国正在就购买数十架空客飞机进行谈判。"
"For China, too, at a time when relations with the United States are at their lowest point in decades, cultivating partners in Europe, especially France and Germany, holds considerable economic and strategic interest as it pursues its post-Covid reopening.",对中国来说也是如此。中美关系正处在几十年来的最低点，在欧洲培养合作伙伴——尤其是与法国和德国——在中国疫情过后重新开放之际有相当大的经济和战略利益。
"In an interview with The New York Times ahead of Mr. Macron's visit, China's ambassador to the European Union, Fu Cong, urged Europe to be more independent of the United States, and suggested Chinese closeness to Russia had been overplayed. Of the ""no-limits"" friendship between the two countries, he said: ""'No limit' is nothing but rhetoric.""","中国驻欧盟大使傅聪在马克龙访华前接受《纽约时报》采访时，敦促欧洲采取更加独立于美国的做法，他还暗示，西方夸大了中俄亲密关系，提到两国之间""无止境""的友谊时，他说:""'无止境'只是个说法而已。"""
"Mr. Xi will hold more than six hours of meetings with Mr. Macron during his three-day visit exceptional treatment that amounts to a statement of serious diplomatic intent including a joint visit to the southern city of Guangzhou, where the Chinese leader has strong family connections.",在为期三天的访问中，习近平与马克龙进行会谈的时间将超过六小时，这种特殊待遇相当于一个严肃的外交意图声明。马克龙的行程还包括访问南方城市广州，中国领导人习近平在广州有很强的家庭关系。
"Last month Mr. Xi accused the United States of leading Western countries in a campaign of ""all-out containment, encirclement and suppression"" against China. Clearly, he sees France as an important interlocutor as the Biden administration imposes strict export controls aimed at cutting off Chinese access to critical technologies.","上个月，习近平指责以美国为首的西方国家对中国实施""全方位的遏制、围堵、打压""。随着拜登政府实行严格的出口管制，以切断中国获得关键技术的途径，他显然把法国视为一个重要的对话者。"
"Through European economic outreach of a kind the United States is not prepared to offer, Mr. Macron may have some leverage in persuading China to take a more constructive diplomatic role in Ukraine. The recent Chinese achievement in brokering an unlikely deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore diplomatic relations was a clear indication of the country's new reach and ambition.",通过提供一些美国不愿意提供的欧洲经济接触，马克龙在说服中国对乌克兰问题发挥更具建设性的外交作用方面，也许拥有某种砝码。最近，中国在沙特阿拉伯和伊朗之间促成了一项看起来难以达成的和解，双方恢复了外交关系，这项成就清楚地表明了中国的新影响力和雄心。
"""Our objective is not to break ties with China,"" the French official said. ""On the contrary, our objective is to reinforce those ties on better foundations.""","""我们的目标不是断绝与中国的联系，""前述法国官员说。 ""我们的目标反而是在更好的基础上加强这些联系。"""
"For the Chinese Communist Party, strong growth is the indispensable guarantor of its authority. But growth fell to 3 percent last year, the lowest rate in many years. Europe can contribute more to an economic rebound than Russia, for all the talk of ""no limits.""","对中共来说，强劲的经济增长是其统治不可或缺的保证。但中国去年的经济增长率已降到了3%，是多年来最低增速。不管中国如何大谈特谈与俄罗斯""无止境""的友谊，与俄罗斯相比，欧洲能为中国经济复苏做出更大贡献。"
"Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, who is accompanying Mr. Macron in a display of European heft, said in a speech last week that ""it is neither viable nor in Europe's interest to decouple from China. Our relations are not black or white and our response cannot be either. This is why we need to focus on de-risk not decouple.""","与马克龙一起前往中国展示欧洲重要性的欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩上周在一个讲话中说，""与中国脱钩既不可行，也不符合欧洲利益。我们的关系不是非黑即白，我们的响应也不能是非黑即白。这就是为什么我们需要将重点放在去风险上——而不是脱钩。"""
"Still, framing China's rise in more direct and ominous terms than Mr. Macron, she said that ""China has now turned the page on the era of 'reform and opening' and is moving into a new era of security and control.""","尽管如此，她用了比马克龙更直接、更令人不安的措辞描述中国的崛起，她说，""中国现在已经翻过了'改革开放'时代的那页，正在进入一个以国家安全和控制为主的新时代。"""
"Given that China ""wants to become the world's most powerful nation"" by midcentury, and is intent on ""systemic change of the international order with China at its center,"" Europe must diversify away from its dependence on China for strategic materials, Ms. von der Leyen, who represents the 27-member European Union, said.","考虑到中国""想在本世纪中叶成为世界上最强大的国家""，正在致力于""系统性地改变国际秩序，使其变成以中国为中心""，欧洲必须采取更多元化的做法，摆脱在战略物资上依赖中国，冯德莱恩说道。欧盟委员会主席是欧盟27个成员国的代表。"
"""We rely on one single supplier China for 98 percent of our rare earth supply, 93 percent of our magnesium and 97 percent of our lithium,"" she said, adding: ""Batteries that are powering our electric vehicles are forecast to drive up demand for lithium by 17 times by 2050.""","她说，""我们依靠单一供应商——中国——来提供我们98%的稀土、93%的镁和97%的锂。""她还表示:""据预测，为我们的电动汽车提供动力的电池，将让2050年的锂需求量增加到目前的17倍。"""
"The French official said Ms. von der Leyen's tougher public views on China's hardening under Mr. Xi did not reflect a difference of appreciation, but rather Mr. Macron's determination to look forward, in order to ""find ways to build, once we know that.""","前述法国官员说，对于中国在习近平的领导下表现出的强硬立场，虽然冯德莱恩在公开场合比马克龙的态度更为严厉，但这个差别反映的并非看法的不同，而是马克龙向前看的决心，是为了""在我们知道存在问题的时候，找到建设性的办法""。"
"With both Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi, the tendency of the French leader has been to acknowledge on the one hand the threat they pose to Western values and democracy, and on the other to insist that only dialogue can bring favorable change.",在普京和习近平眼里，法国领导人马克龙倾向于一方面承认中俄两国对西方价值观和民主制构成威胁，另一方面坚持认为只有对话才能带来有利的变化。
"That dialogue with Mr. Putin, intense in the early months of the war, has broken down in recent months. It bore no apparent fruit.",在俄乌战争的最初几个月里，马克龙曾与普京进行严肃紧张的对话，但对话已在最近几个月失败，没有带来明显的结果。
"""We are an ally of the Americans. We are not equidistant between China and the United States,"" the French official said. ""But we don't have the same positions on China, because we don't have the same interests.""","""我们是美国的盟友。我们在中美之间并非等距，""前述法国官员表示。""但我们在中国问题上与美国有不同的立场，因为我们有不相同的利益。"""
"The potential for China to do great harm whether by arming Russia or invading Taiwan is too real, in the French view, for any other approach than ""re-engagement on the basis of frank dialogue.""","在法国人看来，中国造成巨大伤害的可能性——无论是向俄罗斯提供武器还是入侵台湾——再真实不过了，以至于除了""在坦诚对话的基础上重新接触""之外，没有任何其他方法。"
"This is not the language on China of the Biden administration. But if Mr. Macron, and Europe in general, welcome all the critical American support for the war in Ukraine, they do not want the price of revived trans-Atlanticism to be the European loss of China.",这不是拜登政府对中国使用的语言。但如果说马克龙和欧洲总体来说，欢迎美国在乌克兰战争中提供的关键支持，他们并不希望复活跨大西洋主义的代价是欧洲失去中国。
"Thousands of miles from the cities that Russia is bombing in Ukraine, China has been studying the war.",在受到俄军轰炸的乌克兰城市的数千英里外，中国一直在研究这场战争。
"In an indirect struggle between two superpowers on the other side of the world, Beijing sees a source of invaluable lessons on weapons, troop power, intelligence and deterrence that can help it prepare for potential wars of its own.",这是两个超级大国在世界另一端的一场间接斗争，北京看到的是有关武器、战斗力、情报和威慑的宝贵经验，可以帮助它为自己的潜在战争做好准备。
"In particular, Chinese military analysts have scrutinized the fighting for innovations and tactics that could help in a possible clash over Taiwan, the island democracy that Beijing wants to absorb and the United States has at times pledged to defend.",中国军事分析家尤其通过对战事进行仔细研究，以获得对台湾未来冲突有帮助的创新和战术，台湾是北京想要并入领土的民主岛屿，美国曾屡次承诺保卫该岛。
"The war is a ""proving ground,"" they say, that gives China a chance to learn from successes and failures on both sides. The New York Times examined nearly 100Chinese research papers and media articles that deliver assessments of the war by Chinese military and weapons-sector analysts. Here is some of what they have covered:","他们说，俄乌战争是一个""试验场""，让中国有机会从双方的成功和失败中吸取经验。《纽约时报》查阅了近100篇中国的研究论文和媒体文章，其中陈述了中国军事和武器部门的分析人士对这场战争的评估。以下是其中一些涉及到的内容:"
"With an eye on China's development of hypersonic missiles, which can be highly maneuverable in flight, they have analyzed how Russia used these weapons to destroy anammunition bunker, a fuel depotand other targets.",• 着眼于中国研制的高机动性高超音速导弹，他们分析了俄罗斯如何使用这类武器摧毁一个弹药库、一个燃料库和其他目标。
"They have studied how Ukrainian troops used Starlink satellite links to coordinate attacks and circumvent Russian efforts to shut their communications, and warned that China must swiftly develop a similar low-orbit satellite system and devise ways to knock out rival ones.",• 他们研究了乌克兰军队如何使用星链(Starlink)卫星链接来协调攻击并规避俄罗斯切断其通信，并警告说中国必须迅速开发类似的低轨道卫星系统，并设法摧毁对方的类似系统。
"They have argued that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia deterred Western powers from directly intervening in Ukraine by brandishing nuclear weapons, a view that could encourage expansion of China's own nuclear weaponsprogram.",• 他们认为，俄罗斯总统普京通过声张使用核武器阻止了西方大国直接干预乌克兰，这种观点可能会鼓励中国扩大自己的核武器计划。
"Ukraine has offered ""a new understanding of a future possible world war,"" Maj. Gen. Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the National Defense University in Beijing, wrote in the Guangming Daily newspaper, in January. He also wrote: ""Russia's strategy of nuclear deterrence certainly played a role in ensuring that NATO under the United States' leadership did not dare to directly enter the war.""","1月，北京国防大学教授孟祥庆少将在《光明日报》上写道，乌克兰使得人们""对未来可能发生的世界性战争有了新的认知""。他还写道:""俄罗斯的核威慑战略在这次冲突中确实发挥了让美国为首的北约不敢直接下场参战的作用。"""
"Pentagon officials have said that Russia's troubled invasion serves as a stark warning to China against risking a war over Taiwan, which lies about 100 miles off its coast. Russian forces have been dogged by shortfalls of weapons and ammunition and failures in intelligence, resulting in stalled advances and theheavy loss of soldiers' lives. Some Chinese analysts have been blunt in their views of how Russia has foundered.",五角大楼官员曾表示，俄罗斯入侵遇到的困难对中国构成了一种严厉的警告，令其不敢贸然对距其海岸约100多公里的台湾发动战争。俄罗斯军队一直受到武器和弹药短缺以及情报失误的困扰，导致前进停滞，部队伤亡惨重。一些中国分析人士直截了当地表示俄罗斯搞砸了。
"""The shortcomings that have been exposed in the Russian military's logistics and supplies should be a focus for us,"" said an article in a magazine published by China's agency for developing major military technology. It said thatChina had to prepare for similar challenges ""when we consider future sea crossings, the seizure of islands,"" and other hazard-filled operations an implicit reference to taking Taiwan.","""俄军所暴露出的后勤补给方面的短板应引起我方重视，""一篇文章说，该文发表在中国负责重要军事技术研发的机构主办的杂志上。文章说，""特别是在要考虑在未来跨海、夺岛""和其他充满危险的任务时——暗指拿下台湾，中国必须为类似的挑战做好准备。"
"Ultimately, though, studying Russia's mistakes may bolster China's conviction that it could prevail in a possible conflict, said foreign experts who study the People's Liberation Army. China's official military budget of $225 billion is nearly three times as big as Russia's, and China's vast manufacturing and technological capacity means it can produce plenty of advanced drones and other weapons that Russian forces have lacked.",然而，研究中国人民解放军的外国专家表示，研究俄罗斯的错误最终会增强中国的信念，即可以在未来冲突中制胜。中国2250亿美元的官方军事预算几乎是俄罗斯的三倍，中国庞大的制造和技术能力意味着它可以生产大量先进的无人机和俄罗斯军队缺乏的其他武器。
"""They're going to try to roll those lessons into their training, officer education and doctrine, which is undergoing a revision right now,"" said Joel Wuthnow, a senior research fellow at the National Defense University in Washington who has studied how the People's Liberation Army may be learning from the war in Ukraine. ""This was a wake-up call that things may look easy in field training and on paper, but when you meet the enemy, things get very messy very quickly.""","""他们将尝试将这些经验融入他们的训练、军官教育，以及目前正在修订的准则中，""华盛顿国防大学高级研究员吴志远(Joel Wuthnow)说，他研究了解放军可能正在从乌克兰战争中吸取的经验。""这是一个警钟，有些事情在实兵训练和纸面上看上去简单，但当你遇到敌人时，事情会迅速变得混乱。"""
"China has not fought a major war for 40 years, since Deng Xiaoping sent forces into neighboring Vietnam, and its military scholars study other countries' conflicts with a particular diligence. The war in Ukraine is especially significant for China because it involves an indirect contest pitting Russia, a close partner of Beijing, against the United States and its allies supporting the Ukrainian forces.",自从邓小平派兵进入邻国越南以来，中国已有40年没有打过重大战争，其军事学者特别勤奋地研究其他国家的冲突。乌克兰战争对中国来说尤其重要，因为它涉及一场间接的较量，在北京的亲密伙伴俄罗斯与美国及其支持乌克兰军队的盟友之间展开。
"China is ""close to this war in a way that wasn't true of the Iraq or even Afghanistan wars,"" said Lyle J. Goldstein, an expert at Defense Priorities, a think tank in Washington, who has been studying Chineseassessments of the war in Ukraine. ""They see themselves potentially in Russia's shoes in more or less going to war against America.""","华盛顿智库""国防重点""(Defense Priorities)的专家莱尔·J·戈尔茨坦一直在研究中国对乌克兰战争的评估，他说，中国""离这场战争很近，与伊拉克战争甚至阿富汗战争都不同""。""在与美国开战方面，他们或多或少地觉得自己可能会处于俄罗斯的境地。"""
"Some Chinese experts have said that Russia's difficulties marshaling enough infantry troops suggest that China needs to keep its ground forces strong and large, even while it expands those of sea and air. Russia's experience showed that ""a great power must maintain ground forces of a reasonable scale, otherwise it will lose its advantage on the battlefield,"" Wu Dahui, a former military researcher now at Tsinghua University in Beijing, wrote this year.","一些中国专家表示，俄罗斯难以调集足够的步兵部队，这表明即便是在扩大海上和空中部队的同时，中国也还是需要保持强大且庞大的地面部队。俄罗斯的经验表明，""大国陆军一般都要保有合理的规模，否则就会失去战场优势，""前军事研究员、现供职于清华大学的吴大辉今年写道。"
"Russia's failures in supplying its forces with swift, reliable intelligence about Ukrainian movements have also promptedChinese analysts to urge People's Liberation Army forces to learn how to better use drones, communications and satellites in battle.",俄罗斯未能向其军队提供有关乌克兰动向的迅速、可靠情报，这也促使中国分析人士敦促中国人民解放军部队学习如何在战斗中更好地使用无人机、通信和卫星。
"""Russia wasn't able to scale up different operations, partly because of the lack of intelligence coordination and sharing,"" said Bonny Lin, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""China may now try to engage in exercises that are a much larger scale of complexity.""","""俄罗斯无法扩大不同的行动规模，部分原因是缺乏情报协调和共享，""华盛顿战略与国际研究中心中国力量项目主任林洋说。""中国现在可能会尝试进行复杂程度高很多的演习。"""
"More broadly, Russia's troubles in Ukraine appear to have hardened official Chinese views that Beijing, like Moscow, is the focus of a United States-led campaign of ""hybrid warfare"" that includes economic sanctions, technological bans, information campaigns and cyberattacks.","更广泛地说，俄罗斯在乌克兰的麻烦似乎强化了中国官方的观点，即北京和莫斯科一样，是美国主导的""混合战争""的焦点，包括经济制裁、技术封禁、信息宣传和网络攻击。"
"""The United States and West have seized on this conflict to engage in the total political negation, all-out diplomatic suppression and full cultural isolation of Russia,"" Gao Yun, a researcher at China's Academy of Military Sciences, one of the elite institutions that shapes war planning, wrote in the People's Liberation Army's main newspaper. ""As well as fierce clashes of blood and fire on the battlefields, the combat in the realm of information and perceptions is equally intense.""","""美西方借冲突对俄进行政治全盘否定、外交全面打压、文化完全孤立，""中国军事科学院研究员高云在中国人民解放军的主要报纸上写道。军事科学院是制定战争规划的精英机构之一。""除战场中血与火的惨烈交锋外，信息域认知域战场'搏杀'同样激烈。"""
"As Ukraine's successes mounted, Chinese military analysts have focused on the equipment and intelligence that NATO countries have provided Ukraine to help fight Russian forces. China was most likely monitoring the thousands of Stinger, Javelin and other missiles that Ukraine has acquired, and weighing what would happen as Taiwan built up its stocks, said Mr. Goldstein, who also teaches at Brown University.","随着乌克兰取得越来越多的成功，中国军事分析人士开始关注北约国家为帮助乌克兰对抗俄罗斯军队而提供的装备和情报。同时在布朗大学任教的戈尔茨坦说，中国极有可能在观察乌克兰获得的数千枚""毒刺""、""标枪""和其他导弹，并在考虑随着台湾积累库存，将会发生什么。"
"""I believe that the Chinese are watching all this very carefully and adding the numbers up and making a calculation,"" he said.","""我相信中国正在非常仔细地观察这一切，把各方面数字汇总起来考虑，""他说。"
"Another fixation of Chinese military analysts has been Ukraine's use of Starlink, the satellite service operated by SpaceX, with some suggesting that Beijing should establish a similar system of its own.",中国军事分析人士关注的另一个问题是，乌克兰使用了SpaceX运营的星链卫星服务。一些人建议，北京应该建立自己的类似系统。
"Starlink has helped Ukrainian forces maintain communications and direct attacks even where digital infrastructure has been wiped out. Chinese military analysts have blamed the inability of Russian forces to cut Starlink for its troubles on the battlefield. Starlink satellites arecheaper to launch and operatethan traditional satellites. Inspired by Ukraine, Taiwan has also begun studying the technology.","""星链""帮助乌克兰军队在数字基础设施已经被摧毁的情况下也能保持通信和直接攻击。中国军事分析人士将俄罗斯在战场上遇到的麻烦归咎于俄军无法切断""星链""。星链卫星比传统卫星发射和操作成本更低。受乌克兰的启发，台湾也开始研究这项技术。"
"""Faced with the threat of Starlink,"" Chinese rocket and military researchers said in a study, ""we must develop and build our own low-orbiting satellites.""","""因此面对'星链'的威胁，需发展和建设自有的低轨星座，""中国火箭和军事研究人员在一项研究中说。"
"Chinese army engineering scientists, in a paper also cited in a recent Reuters report, suggested that the United States could use such technology in a conflict with China. ""Not a moment can be spared in developing 'soft kill' and 'hard kill' measures against low-orbit satellite arrays,"" the scientists wrote. In other words, ways to sabotage or destroy them.","路透社最近的一篇报道也引用了中国陆军工程科学家的一篇论文，称美国可以在与中国的冲突中使用这种技术。科学家们写道:""探索对低轨道卫星群，'软杀伤'和'硬杀伤'措施刻不容缓""。换言之，就是探索破坏或摧毁它们的方法。"
"Chinese military analysts appear to also be drawing lessons relevant to Beijing's nuclear buildup. They have argued that Mr. Putin's nuclear threats were effective in keeping President Biden and NATO from directly entering the war. In a potential invasion of Taiwan, Beijing would consider how it might deter Washington, which has pledged to help the island defend itself, and could directly intervene in a military conflict.",中国的军事分析人士似乎也在吸取与北京的核建设有关的教训。他们认为，普京的核威胁有效地阻止了拜登总统和北约直接参战。在可能入侵台湾的情况下，北京将考虑如何威慑已承诺帮助台湾自卫、并可能直接干预军事冲突的美国。
"""From this it can be seen that nuclear forces are how a great power displays its stature,"" two Chinese rocket researchers wrote in one article about Russian strategy.","""由此可以看出，核力量是一个大国展示自己地位的方式，""两名中国火箭研究人员在一篇关于俄罗斯战略的文章中写道。"
"China has denounced the use of nuclear weapons in the war and vows that it would never initiate an attack with nuclear weapons. Even so, China's leader, Xi Jinping, indicated last year that China will keep expanding its nuclear arsenal, which now has over 400 warheads, still far fewer than the number held by Russia or the United States.",中国反对在战争中使用核武器，并发誓永远不会率先使用核武器。尽管如此，中国领导人习近平去年的讲话显示，中国将不断扩大其核武库，目前中国已有超过400枚核弹头，仍远远少于俄罗斯或美国持有的数量。
"China's nuclear arsenal could grow to about 1,000 warheads by 2030, according to the Pentagon. Mr. Putin's menacing gestures may set an example for Chinese leaders, said Mr. Wuthnow of the National Defense University.",根据五角大楼的说法，到2030年，中国的核武库可能会增长到大约1000枚核弹头。美国国防大学的吴志远说，普京的威胁姿态可能会为中国领导人树立一个榜样。
"""My main worry is a miscalculation"" over nuclear threats, Mr. Wuthnow said. ""Xi could come to believe that the U.S. and its allies could be easily sidelined in a Taiwan conflict. But this would likely be an error in judgment.""","""我主要担心的是(对核威胁的)误判，""吴志远说。""习近平可能会认为，在台湾冲突中，美国及其盟友很容易袖手旁观。但这很可能是一个判断错误。"""
"Last October, executives at the Chinese gaming company NetEase and the American video game developer Activision Blizzard joined a Zoom videoconference to discuss the future of their 14-year partnership to offer Activision's games like World of Warcraft in China.",去年10月，中国游戏公司网易和美国视频游戏开发商动视暴雪的高管举行Zoom视频会议，讨论他们14年合作关系的未来，该合作将《魔兽世界》等动视游戏带到了中国。
NetEase executives were worried about new laws imposed by the Chinese government and wanted to make changes to their longstanding contract with Activision to ensure they were in compliance.,网易高管对中国政府实施的新法律感到担忧，希望修改他们与动视的长期合同，以确保合规。
"But the companies left the call with drastically different interpretations of what had been said, according to four people familiar with the talks and a document viewed by The New York Times. What NetEase executives contended was a conciliatory gesture was seen as a threat by Activision executives. A month later, the companies broke off talks.",但根据四名知情人士和《纽约时报》看到的一份文件，两家公司在电话会议结束后，对谈话内容的解读截然不同。网易高管所称的调解姿态被动视高管视为威胁。一个月后，两家公司中断了谈判。
"In January, more than three million Chinese players lost access to Activision's iconic games when the partnership ended, and angry NetEase employees livestreamed the dismantling of a 32-foot sculpture of an ax from World of Warcraft that stood outside NetEase's headquarters in Hangzhou, China.",今年1月，当合作关系结束时，超过300万中国玩家失去了体验动视标志性游戏的机会，愤怒的网易员工在杭州网易总部外直播了10米高的《魔兽世界》斧头雕塑被拆除的过程。
"The testy breakup, after months of talks, ended a relationship that had seemed to prove that global commerce could thrive despite deepening geopolitical rifts. A partnership that had been worth about $750 million in annual revenue, according to company filings and the video game research firm Niko Partners, had become another case study in the increasing difficulty of doing business in China.",这段合作关系原本似乎可以证明全球商业在地缘政治分歧不断加深的情况下依然可以蓬勃发展，然而在历经几个月的谈判后却以一拍两散而告终。根据公司备案文件和视频游戏研究公司Niko Partners的数据，这项合作的年收入原本约为7.5亿美元，如今已经成为在中国做生意越来越困难的又一个案例。
"Details of the breakdown in negotiations between Activision and NetEase provide an unusual, behind-the-scenes look at how Chinese and American companies are struggling to balance the interests of the Chinese government with what they believe is best for their businesses.",动视和网易谈判破裂的细节提供了一个不同寻常的幕后视角，让我们看到中美企业如何努力寻求平衡，一方面考虑中国政府的利益，另一方面顾及双方认为对其业务最有利的东西。
"China's government, under its leader, Xi Jinping, has clamped down on China's largest internet companies and urged businesses to adhere to the Communist Party's priorities. It has barred children from playing video games on school days and tightened its already strict approval processes for companies to distribute new games. Last year, China's $39 billion gaming market contracted for the first time in years.",在习近平的领导下，中国政府对中国最大的几家互联网公司进行了打击，并敦促企业遵守共产党的优先事项。它禁止儿童在非节假日玩电子游戏，并收紧了本就已经很严格的新游戏发行审批程序。去年，中国390亿美元的游戏市场出现多年来的首次萎缩。
"""The private sector in China is in a very weak position now,"" said Duncan Clark, the chairman of the Beijing-based investment advisory firm BDA China. ""The cost of accessing the China market has gone up for Western companies, and for domestic companies, there is a greater fear of arbitrary regulations.""","""中国的私营部门现在处于非常弱势的地位，""总部在北京的投资咨询公司BDA中国董事长邓肯·克拉克说。""对于西方企业来说，进入中国市场的成本已经上升，而对于国内企业来说，他们更担心任意武断的监管。"""
"In a statement, Michael Lee, an Activision vice president, said the company's experience in China had been ""very positive"" for nearly 20 years, including its decade-long partnership with Tencent to offer Call of Duty. ""While it's true that the partnership you're describing took a surprising and troubling turn, it's important to recognize that this was an anomaly,"" Mr. Lee said.","动视副总裁迈克尔·李在一份声明中表示，近20年来，该公司在中国的经历一直是""非常正面的""，包括与腾讯合作推出《使命召唤》长达10年。""虽然你所描述的合作关系确实发生了令人惊讶和不安的转变，但重要的是，要认识到这是一种异常情况，""李说。"
"Alexandru Voica, a NetEase spokesman, said NetEase had moved on, and ""we suggest Activision Blizzard do the same.""","网易发言人亚历山德鲁·沃伊卡表示，网易已经向前看，""我们建议动视暴雪也这么做。"""
"Since 2020, China's antitrust regulators have been reviewing old mergers and joint ventures that drew large amounts of foreign capital. New antitrust amendmentslast summer significantly raised the fine for failing to comply with those reviews.",自2020年以来，中国反垄断监管机构一直在审查吸引大量外资的旧有并购及合资企业。去年夏天，新的反垄断法修正案大幅提高了违反审查规定的罚款。
"Last year, NetEase executives asked Activision to file relevant disclosures, such as annual revenues and details about parts of its business, to Chinese regulators, but Activision disputed that it was out of compliance with the law or that it was required to turn over more information, according to four people with knowledge of the situation and documents viewed by The Times.",据四名知情人士和时报看到的文件称，去年，网易高管要求动视向中国监管机构提交相关信息披露，比如年收入和部分业务的细节，但动视提出异议，认为这些要求要么不符合法律规定，要么没有提供更多信息的必要。
"In the contract renegotiations with Activision, conducted every few years since the partnership started, NetEase said it wanted to end the companies' joint venture agreement a business entity that helped NetEase distribute games from Blizzard Entertainment, an Activision subsidiary, in China. NetEase said it wanted Activision to license its games directly to NetEase, which would give NetEase more control over operations and allow it to better comply with the new regulations without Activision's help.",自双方开始合作以来，网易每隔几年就会与动视就签约重新谈判。在谈判中，网易表示希望终止两家公司的合资协议，该合资企业是一个帮助网易在中国发行动视子公司暴雪娱乐旗下游戏的商业实体。网易表示，希望动视将其游戏直接授权给网易，这将使网易对运营有更多控制权，并使其在没有动视帮助的情况下更好地遵守新规定。
"Andrew Tang, a veteran gaming executive in China with close ties to Activision, said he thought NetEase was simply using the antitrust regulations as an excuse to get a better deal.",与动视关系密切的中国资深游戏行业高管唐嘉隆说，他认为网易只是把反垄断规定作为借口，以便获得更有利的交易。
"NetEase is ""under a lot of pressure the last couple of years because of all these crackdowns and limiting kids' play,"" Mr. Tang said. ""Ultimately, I think it all has to do with the bottom line.""","网易""过去几年承受着很大的压力，因为所有这些对儿童玩游戏的打击和限制""，唐嘉隆说。""归根结底，我认为这一切都与利益有关。"""
"But tensions had been building before last year's contract renewal discussions, according to the people familiar with the talks.",但据知情人士透露，在去年的续约谈判之前，双方之间的紧张关系就已经在加剧。
"NetEase executives believed Bobby Kotick, Activision's chief executive, had made unreasonable demands over the years, two of the people said. In 2018, NetEase announced a $100 million investment in Bungie, a game developer that worked with Activision to produce Destiny, a popular game. Mr. Kotick was unhappy with the investment becauseBungie was behind schedule on developing Destiny content, and he worried the investment would further distract the company from its Destiny obligations, two other people said.",其中两名知情人士表示，网易高管认为，动视首席执行官鲍比·科蒂克多年来提出了不合理的要求。2018年，网易宣布，向与动视合作开发热门游戏《命运》的游戏开发商Bungie投资一亿美元。另外两名知情人士说，科蒂克对这笔投资感到不满，因为Bungie的《命运》开发进度滞后，他担心这笔投资会进一步分散该公司对《命运》的责任。
"That year, NetEase invested in a game development companyfounded by a person who had until recently been a senior Activision employee, which also angered Activision, the people said. Mr. Kotick considered ending the partnership. A 2019 deal between Activision and NetEase included restrictions that prevented NetEase from hiring former Activision employees or investing in gaming studios directed by them.",知情人士说，那一年，网易投资了一家游戏开发公司，该公司创始人在那不久前还是动视的一名高级员工，这也激怒了动视。科蒂克曾考虑结束合作关系。动视和网易在2019年达成的一项协议包括限制网易雇佣前动视员工，或投资由他们执掌的游戏工作室。
"Those tensions came to a head in the call last October. Mr. Kotick and William Ding, the chief executive of NetEase, discussed the many antitrust regulators around the world scrutinizing Microsoft's $70 billion deal to purchase Activision, two people with knowledge of the call said. Mr. Kotick told Mr. Ding that he would consider the licensing proposal, even though he worried that a switch could rattle Chinese regulators before an important political meeting that month and cede more control over Activision's intellectual property to NetEase.",这种紧张关系在去年10月的通话中达到了顶峰。据两名知情人士透露，科蒂克和网易首席执行官丁磊讨论了世界各地众多反垄断监管机构对微软以700亿美元收购动视的交易进行审查的问题。科蒂克对丁磊说，他会考虑转为授权的提议，尽管他担心在当月的一次重要政治会议之前，此举可能会惊动中国监管机构，并将动视知识产权的更多控制权交给网易。
"At some point in the conversation, which was conducted at times through translators, Activision executives felt that Mr. Ding threatened Mr. Kotick. The Chinese government was reviewing the Microsoft acquisition, and the executives recalled that Mr. Ding said NetEase could sway the government either to block or support that deal depending on the outcome of the licensing discussion, according to two people familiar with the call and a document reviewed by The Times.",在这次时不时需要通过翻译进行的谈话中，动视高管一度觉得丁磊在威胁科蒂克。据两名知情人士和时报看到的一份文件称，中国政府正在审查微软的收购，高管们回忆说，丁磊说网易可以影响政府对微软交易的态度，政府会阻止还是支持，取决于这场关于授权的谈判能谈出什么结果。
"But NetEase executives did not intend to make a threat and were trying to be conciliatory toward Activision, said two other people familiar with the conversation. The point they intended to make was that if Activision did not switch to a licensing deal, Microsoft would face the same regulatory hurdles when it acquired the company.",但据了解此次谈话的两名人士称，网易高管没有威胁的意思，只是在调解。他们的意思是，如果动视不转为授权协议，微软在收购该公司时会面临同样的监管障碍。
"Mr. Voica, the NetEase spokesman, denied that Mr. Dinghad threatened Activision. He said Activision was continuing to ""harass and taunt companies and regulators worldwide.""","网易发言人沃伊卡否认丁磊曾经威胁动视。他说动视一直在""滋扰和奚落世界各地的企业和监管机构""。"
Microsoft declined to comment.,微软拒绝置评。
"After the Zoom call, Activision made a counteroffer: It would switch to a licensing agreement if NetEase paid it roughly $500 million upfront, rather than in payments throughout the course of the deal, according to three people familiar with the negotiations. That was meant to insulate Activision from the risk that its games could be tied up in government approval processes or be replicated without its consent.",据熟悉双方磋商的三名人士称，经过那次Zoom通话后，动视反过来提出:如果网易能预付约5亿美元，而不是在合同期内分次支付，它可以转为授权协议。这是为了规避风险，以防旗下游戏在政府审批上遇阻，或在未授权的情况下被复制。
"NetEase later said in a statement that Activision's terms were ""commercially illogical,"" and the stage was set for the contract to expire in January.","网易后来发布声明说，动视给出的条件""不符合商业逻辑""，双方的合约将于1月到期。"
"When the breakup became public in November, it sent shock waves through the Chinese gaming community. Shares of NetEase stockplunged in Hong Kong.",停止合作的消息11月公布后，在中国游戏社区掀起轩然大波。在香港上市的网易股票暴跌。
"As time was running out, Activision made a last-ditch proposal to extend the partnership for six months so gamers could keep playing while it searched for a new long-term partner, as the business news site Yicai Global reported. NetEase declined the new offer, and in a statement likened it to ""staying together while being divorced.""","据商业新闻网站一财的报道，眼看时间所剩不多，动视做出了最后的努力，提议将双方的合作延长六个月，让玩家可以继续玩游戏，同时寻找新的长期合作方。网易拒绝了这个提议，在声明中形容这无异于""离婚不离身""。"
"In mid-January, NetEase contractors destroyed the World of Warcraft ax sculpture. As the contractors swung hammers at it, employees livestreamed the demolition to 30,000 people. NetEase said local law required it to clear out another company's intellectual property after the partnership was terminated.",1月中旬，网易雇用的施工队拆除了魔兽斧头雕塑。公司雇员直播了工人挥舞锤子拆雕塑的过程，有30000人收看。网易称法律规定当合作关系解除时，需要清除另一方的知识资产。
"In late January, most of Activision's games including World of Warcraft, Diablo III and Overwatch went dark in China. Chinese companies, including NetEase, released games that some analysts said bore close similarities to the shuttered Activision titles.",1月底，动视的大多数游戏——包括《魔兽世界》、《暗黑破坏神III》和《守望先锋》——已经在中国下线。在许多分析师看来，包括网易在内，许多中国公司发布的一些游戏和动视撤下的游戏十分相似。
"NetEase also made a recruiting pitch to former World of Warcraft players, hoping to get them to join Justice Online, a NetEase game in the same genre as World of Warcraft. Online, people posted photos of items from the Justice and Warcraft games that resembled each other.",网易还试图招募前魔兽玩家，希望他们来玩《逆水寒》，这是网易推出的一款和《魔兽世界》同类型的游戏。网上有人贴出了两款游戏的物品图片，展现两者的相似之处。
NetEase said its games did not share similarities with Activision's.,网易称该游戏和动视的产品没有相似的地方。
"Activision has said that it plans to return to China and that it is in talks with other Chinese companies to distribute its games. In the past, both Tencent and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, have expressed interest in working with Activision. Activision has also considered teaming up with telecommunications companies like China Mobile, two people said.",动视称其打算重返中国，目前正在与其它公司洽谈游戏发行事宜。腾讯以及字节跳动——TikTok的所有者——都曾表达过有意与动视合作。有两人透露，动视还曾考虑与中国移动等电信公司合作。
"For China's gamers, the breakup was devastating. Zhang Yu, a 35-year-old World of Warcraft playerin Beijing, said he was still mourning the loss of a game that had been a constant companion and connected him with thousands of people since 2005.","这次""分手""给中国游戏玩家带来巨大的打击，35岁的北京魔兽玩家张宇(音)说他至今还感到难过，这款游戏从2005年起一直陪伴着他，让他和成千上万的人建立联系。"
"""What I'm most worried about now,"" Mr. Yu said, ""is that these friendships will disappear.""","""我现在最担心的是，""他说，""这些友情会消失。"""
"Just like relationships between people, relationships between countries can all too easily be built on a foundation of unintentional misunderstandings, faulty assumptions and predigested truths. In her forthcoming, at times provocative and disquieting book, ""The New China Playbook,"" Keyu Jin, a professor at the London School of Economics and a board member at Credit Suisse, is trying to rework the foundation of what she sees as the West's deeply flawed understanding of China's economy, its economic ambitions and its attitude toward global competition. And through that work, Jin wants to help improve the frosty relationship between the country and its presumed geo-political opponents. ""We're in an incredibly dangerous world right now,"" says Jin, who was born in Beijing and earned her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard and whose father, Jin Liqun, served as a vice minister of finance for China. ""Without more effort made to understand each other's perspectives, peaceful coexistence may not be possible."" (Jin joined the Credit Suisse board in 2022, not long after the bank was shaken by a series of scandals and losses. After this interview was conducted, the bank was sold to UBS, another Swiss bank. Through a spokes-person, Jin declined to comment on Credit Suisse's situation.)","就像人与人之间的关系那样，国家之间的关系也很容易建立在无意的误解、错误的假设，以及过于简化的事实基础上。伦敦政治经济学院教授、瑞士信贷董事会成员金刻羽即将出版新书《新的中国战略手册》(The New China Playbook)，在这本有时具有煽动性、有时令人不安的书中，她试图重建西方与中国关系的基础，她认为西方对中国经济、中国的经济野心，以及中国如何看待全球竞争的理解存在严重缺陷。金刻羽希望通过这种重建来帮助改善中国与其假定的地缘政治对手之间的冷淡关系。金刻羽在北京出生，在哈佛大学获得了经济学博士学位，她的父亲金立群曾任中国财政部副部长。""我们正处在一个极其危险的世界中，""她说。""如果不做出更大努力来了解彼此的观点，和平共处恐怕是不可能的。""(金刻羽2022年加入瑞士信贷董事会，之后不久，这家银行因一系列丑闻和亏损濒临崩溃。瑞士信贷已在这次采访之后被另一家瑞士银行瑞银收购。金刻羽通过一名发言人拒绝对瑞士信贷的情况置评。)"
"What do U.S. policymakers just not get about China's economy and the Communist Party leadership's thinking about competition with America? China's current economic challenge is to overcome its middle-income trap, something that the United States might not relate to. It's not all about displacing the United States as global hegemon, which would come with a huge amount of burdens and responsibilities. And I don't think China is ready or willing to do that. To see China solely as trying to displace the United States is only going to stoke more fears. The United States can come up with better policies regarding real national-security concerns, but the government is doing things that to us are so un-American, like reducing the number of visas issued or curbing investment in China and Chinese investment in America. That doesn't seem to be the spirit of collaboration. But understanding where China is coming from would be a step forward.",关于中国经济以及中共领导人如何看待中美竞争，美国的决策者究竟存在怎样的误解?中国当前的经济挑战是克服中等收入陷阱，这也许是美国不了解的东西。这不都是关于要取代美国成为全球霸主，那会给中国带来巨大的负担和责任。我不认为中国已经做好准备或愿意承担那些责任。将中国仅仅视为试图取代美国的国家只会引发更多的恐惧。虽然美国可以就真正的国家安全担忧拿出更好的政策，但在我们看来，美国政府正在做的事情太不符合美国价值了，比如减少发放签证数量，或限制美国对中国以及中国对美国的投资。这似乎不是合作精神。但了解中国的出发点将是一个进步。
"Do you see large-scale Chinese industrial espionage as inhibiting that understanding? There are thorny issues between the two countries, and the more they trade, the more issues there are. But we want to see China as dynamic. It has changed a great deal. China liked to take the shortcuts in the beginning. It wanted to become an innovator, and it wanted to become great. But there was not a complete legal framework or rules and laws in place. China changed so it could join the World Trade Organization. Interestingly enough, these so-called technology transfers, or the misappropriation you mentioned lots of industry studies show that they don't work as effectively as they were supposed to. Instead, for example, in the electric-vehicle sector, where everybody started from the same place, China was able to leapfrog. Lots of companies say that even at the risk of technological misappropriation, China is too lucrative a market to pass over. They would rather take the risk.",你认为中国的大规模工业间谍活动是这种了解的障碍吗?中美两国之间有很多棘手的问题，而且贸易越多，问题也越多。但我们想动态地看中国。中国已发生了很大的变化。中国开始时喜欢走捷径，想成为一个创新者，想变得伟大。但没有一个完整的法律框架或可用的规则和法律。中国为加入世界贸易组织有所改变。有趣的是，许多行业研究表明，这些所谓的技术转让，或者你所说的盗用，并不像预期的那样有效。反而是在大家都从同一个地方起步的领域，例如电动汽车，中国能跨越式发展。许多公司说，即使存在技术盗用的风险，中国市场的利润也丰厚到不可错过的程度。他们宁愿冒那个险。
"It seems pretty apparent that President Xi Jinping is moving away from the United States and the European Union and toward other countries with politically similar systems, like Russia or Iran. But those countries are unlikely to be economic partners for China on the level of the U.S. or the E.U. What are the implications of that shift for China's longer-term economic growth? China has a slightly different world vision from the U.S. and maybe from Europe, which is coexistence of different political systems, different economic systems, a multipolar world I think that's one of China's global agendas. Of course, intereconomically, there is much more trade. China still upholds this view of globalization, but geopolitics is making this increasingly difficult. So I would argue that at the same time it seeks this multipolar balance, it is slightly pushed to become closer to some of these countries that you mentioned.",很明显，习近平主席正在远离美国和欧盟，转向其他政治体制相似的国家，比如俄罗斯或者伊朗。但这些国家不太可能成为中国在美国或欧盟那种层面上的经济伙伴。这种转变对中国的长期经济增长有什么影响?中国的世界观与美欧略有不同，即不同的政治制度、不同的经济制度共存，以及世界的多极化——我认为这是中国的全球议程之一。当然，从经济上讲，要有更多的贸易。中国仍然坚持这种全球化观点，但地缘政治使之变得越来越困难。所以我认为，在寻求这种多极平衡的同时，它也稍微受到了推动，与你提到的这些国家当中的一些走得更近。
"But what's pushing China toward more closely aligning with Russia if not political affinity? To be very frank, it's hard to say, ""Let's hold hands with Europe and the United States,"" after the increasing tension, the export controls, the view that somehow the United States wants to limit China's development and advancement in technology innovation. People believe that there was demonization of China early in the pandemic; there was aggressive rhetoric during Donald Trump's presidency. It's more difficult after that happens to say, ""OK, let's work on things like Russia and Ukraine."" Russia and I'm not an expert on these issues presents some security concerns for China. The Chinese people believe that a substantially weakened Russia might not be in the interest of China, because if there were the sense that the United States needed to seek out an opponent, China would be next. Not an easy answer there.","但是，如果不是政治上的认同，是什么在推动中国与俄罗斯更紧密地结盟呢?非常坦率地说，经过了紧张局势加剧、出口管制、认为美国在某种程度上想限制中国在技术创新方面的发展和进步之后，中国很难说出""让我们与欧洲和美国携手吧""。人们认为，大流行早期出现了对中国的妖魔化;唐纳德·特朗普在担任总统期间发表了侵略性言论。发生这种情况后，再说""好吧，让我们一起处理俄罗斯和乌克兰这样的问题""就更困难了。俄罗斯问题——我不是这些方面的专家——给中国带来了一些安全考量。中国人认为，一个大幅削弱的俄罗斯可能不符合中国的利益，因为如果人们觉得美国需要寻找一个对手，那么中国将是下一个。这不是一个三言两语就能说清楚的问题。"
"But to be honest, one of the things that I found most interesting or perplexing about your book was what felt like an elision of moral questions about how China operates. For example, you say there's room for a vibrant debate on Chinese social media. But China is consistently ranked near the bottom when it comes to media freedom. Or you write that the Chinese people are generally willing to trade security for freedom. Were the Uyghurs willing to make that trade? The book also doesn't mention the human rights questions raised by the hukou system and the way it treats rural residents. I'm trying to understand your perspective on these issues, because to me they seem connected to economics. I appreciate these questions. One reason it's probably not thoroughly addressed is because my book is about economics and political economy. I wanted to touch upon points where there were surveys and data. These other subjects require more expertise and more thorough research, which I haven't done. For sure, there's much more control over media than in the past. I was pointing out in the book, though, that social media is used for two-way monitoring. There was a lot of criticism about government; there were protests last year over land seizures. These were not hidden. But the Chinese government does exhibit a great deal of paternalism. Officials think that a public narrative that is uncontrolled can lead to instability or more divisiveness. I'm not saying that the people prefer it that way, but when they're asked about a trade-off between security and freedom, surveys show a vast difference from, say, the average U.S. citizen. Then you touched upon the huge issues of the migrant workers, the minorities in China. There are hundreds of millions people who could be in a better position, but things are changing. These are enduring challenges. On the one hand, yes, there's more control, less liberty. On the other hand, there is an improving situation for people with more dire situations.",但是说实话，我发现你的书中最有趣——或者说最令人困惑——的其中一点是，感觉你回避了对中国如何运作的道德问题。例如，你说在中国的社交媒体上有一个充满活力的辩论空间。但在媒体自由方面，中国的排名一直接近垫底。或者你写道，中国人民通常愿意用安全换取自由。维吾尔人愿意做这种交易吗?书中也没有提到户口制度，以及它对待农村人口的方式所引起的人权问题。我想了解你对这些问题的看法，因为对我来说，它们似乎与经济有关。谢谢你的问题。这个问题可能没有彻底讨论的一个原因是，我的书是关于经济和政治经济学的。我想讨论有调查和数据的东西。其他这些课题需要更多的专业知识和更彻底的研究，而我还没有做这些工作。可以肯定的是，现在对媒体的控制比过去多得多。不过，我在书中指出，社交媒体被用于双向监督。有很多对政府的批评;去年发生了与征地相关的抗议活动。这些都没有被隐藏。但中国政府确实表现出了大量的家长式作风。官员们认为，不受控制的公共叙事会导致不稳定或更多的分裂。我并不是说人民喜欢这种方式，但当他们被问及安全和自由之间的权衡时，调查显示，结果与普通美国公民有很大的不同。然后你提到中国的农民工和少数民族这个大问题。数以亿计的人处境本可以更好，但情况正在发生变化。这些是持久的挑战。一方面，是的，有更多的控制，更少的自由。另一方面，对于处境更糟糕的人来说，情况也在改善。
"The treatment of the Uyghurs doesn't quite fit the framework of an improving situation. David, I understand. This particular subject is something where I have so little information and I don't know what's going on and there's so many different accounts. I prefer not to comment on this and be irresponsible. But it is open for visits now. I think people should go take a look, then make a judgment on their own. It's a complex situation. There are improvements, there are deteriorations, and we have to recognize that.",维吾尔人的待遇并不完全符合改善状况的框架。戴维，我理解。对于这个特定的主题，我所掌握的信息太少，我不知道发生了什么，而且有这么多不同的说法。我宁愿不对此发表不负责任的评论。但现在那里已经对外人开放了。我认为人们应该去看一看，然后自己做出判断。这是一个复杂的情况。有改善，也有恶化，我们必须承认这一点。
"Do you feel inhibited in your ability to be critical of China? I'm an economist at the end of the day, and the way I'm trained, we like to say, ""OK, where is the evidence?"" That's how I like to focus my analysis. Where there are policy mistakes, I'd be more than happy to share my views. There are more courageous people and more experts who can do that. What I'm trying to accomplish is using a different lens to focus on economic issues.","你是否感觉自己批评中国的能力受到了压制?归根结底，我是经济学家，根据我接受的训练，我们喜欢说，""好吧，证据在哪里?""这就是我分析的重点所在。在政策出现错误的地方，我非常乐意分享我的观点。有更多勇敢的人和更多专家可以做到这一点。我想要实现的是用不同的视角来关注经济问题。"
"You mentioned the trade-offs that people are willing to make within different political systems, which you also write about in the book: ""Despite the limits China imposes on free-market forces, the absence of a free press, independent judicial system and the individual right to vote, we see there are other mechanisms in place to respond to the needs of its citizens and to address the threats posed by inequality."" That ""despite"" is doing a lot of work. It reminds me of that line, ""Other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?"" I was trying to say that those are all things that we believe to be essential for sustained economic growth. I was saying that despite all that, China still performed well. I wasn't necessarily suggesting that the things you mentioned weren't important. I was more framing it as the puzzle of China's economic growth. I was trying to say that those are all things that we believe to be essential for sustained economic growth. I was saying that despite all that, China still performed well. But I will say that the model that worked for China when it was building factories is not going to be the system that would work for innovation, where you need people to be able to get rich, where you need solid intellectual-property protection, where you have to have clear and transparent policies and rule of law. That worked in the last era. Doesn't necessarily work in the new era.","你提到人们在不同的政治制度下愿意做出的权衡，你在书中还写道:""尽管中国对自由市场力量施加了限制，缺乏新闻自由、独立的司法系统和个人投票权，但我们看到还有其他机制可以回应公民的需求，并应对不平等带来的威胁。""这个""尽管""非常重要。这让我想起了那句台词，""除此之外，林肯夫人，这出戏怎么样?""(意为忽略重点——译注)我想说的是，这些都是我们认为对经济保持持续增长至关重要的事情。我是说尽管如此，中国仍然表现良好。我并不是说你提到的事情不重要。我倾向于将其描述为中国经济增长之谜。但我要说的是，在中国建立工厂时起作用的模式不会适用于创新体系，在创新中，你需要人们能够致富，你需要坚实的知识产权保护，在这方面你必须有清晰透明的政策和法治。这在上个时代行得通。不一定适用于新时代。"
"Let's turn the lens of your book around: What are the biggest blind spots the Chinese leadership has when it comes to understanding American policies toward the country? I think the Chinese leaders have this notion that the United States is doing everything it can to try to stop China from growing. Or they believe that whatever China does is not going to elicit more trust. So I think this blind spot is that the leadership is convinced that there's no way out of this. I'm not sure that is the case. And then also, the United States thinks that China wants to displace it.",让我们换一个角度看你的书:在理解美国对华政策方面，中国领导人的最大盲点是什么?我认为中国领导人有这样一种观念，即美国正在竭尽全力阻止中国的发展。或者他们认为，无论中国做什么，都不会赢得更多信任。所以我认为这个盲点是，领导层确信这方面没有解决办法。我不觉得是这样。此外还有，美国认为中国想要取代它。
"Doesn't it? No. China thinks that its economy should be the largest in the world, not because it's rich but because it's large: 1.4 billion people! But that's very different from overtaking the United States in terms of innovative power and military power and real economic power. I don't think anybody believes that is a realistic goal for China. Again, we have very different understandings of how we see each other.",不是吗?不是的。中国认为它的经济应该是世界上最大的，不是因为它富有，而是因为它很大:14亿人!但这与在创新能力、军事实力和实际经济实力方面超越美国截然不同。我觉得没有人会认为这对中国来说是一个现实的目标。同样，我们对如何看待彼此有非常不同的理解。
"What specific things, besides stopping industrial espionage, could China do to increase trust? Giving American companies, financial institutions, more opportunities to make money, opening up its various sectors more aggressively that will allow more dialogue, more cooperation. That's one thing. Second, it's understandable for the United States to push back on some of the industrial espionage. But China's best technologies, the ones that are really successful right now, artificial intelligence or batteries or its payment system all of that is based on domestic competition. The industrial espionage stems from a lack of appreciation from the start of intellectual property, and the United States, by pushing China to do more intellectual-property protection, is actually good for China. I think it's on a substantial downward trend, this misappropriation of technologies, because it's actually not good for China's own goals.",除了制止工业间谍活动，中国还可以采取哪些具体措施来增强信任?给美国公司、金融机构更多赚钱的机会，更积极地开放各个领域——这将使得出现更多的对话、更多的合作。这是一方面。其次，美国抵制一些工业间谍活动是可以理解的。但中国最好的技术，目前真正成功的技术，人工智能或电池或其支付系统——所有这些都基于国内竞争。工业间谍源于一开始对知识产权缺乏重视，而美国通过推动中国加强知识产权保护，实际上对中国有利。我认为这种盗用技术的情况呈大幅下降趋势，因为这实际上不利于中国自己的目标。
"The next question is more of an epistemological one. The animating idea of your book is that people see the same situation from different perspectives. So when you hear my skepticism about things like Chinese labor policy or media freedom being treated benignly, do you hear it as my being stuck in a particular ideological paradigm? Or maybe that my thinking is itself an example of the misunderstandings that the book is trying to address? I totally understand, because the first time I came to the United States in 1997, my classmates were asking me about human rights in Tibet. In China, meanwhile, we were busy building and developing and reforming. The focal points have been different. That's not to say that the economic means justify the unfortunate circumstances. But China is a country that has done the most economically for the most number of people in the shortest amount of time. If you look at the new generation, they are open-minded on a whole range of issues, so much more than their parents. They care about animal rights, worker rights, social inequity. That shift gives us hope that China will progress.",下一个问题更像是一个认识论问题。在你的书里，人们从不同的角度看待相同的情况，这是一个生动的立意。那么，当你听到我对中国的劳工政策或媒体自由受到尊重等问题持怀疑态度时，你是否认为我陷入了一种特定的意识形态范式?或者说，我的想法也许本身就是一个示例，是这本书试图消除的误解之一?我完全理解，因为1997年我第一次来美国时，同学们问我西藏的人权问题。与此同时，在中国，我们忙于建设、发展和改革。关注点不同。这并不是说经济手段可以证明不幸的事情是合理的。但是中国是一个在经济方面用最短的时间为最多人做出努力的国家。如果你看看新一代，他们在一系列问题上都持开放态度，比他们的父辈要开放得多。他们关心动物权利、工人权利和社会不平等。这种转变让我们对中国的进步充满希望。
"In 1984, when China was in its early embrace of capitalism, 29-year-old He Lifeng was near the center of the action. A Communist Party member with two degrees in government finance, he got a municipal job in Xiamen, a coastal city that had just been freed by Deng Xiaoping from central planning dictates to test free markets.",1984年，中国开始接受资本主义时，29岁的何立峰恰好身处这一变化的中心。作为拥有两个财政金融学位的党员，他进入厦门市政府工作，这座沿海城市刚被邓小平从计划经济下解放出来，成为尝试自由市场改革的试点。
"Over the next two decades in Xiamen and nearby cities, Mr. He rose to become a senior party official and top local leader. And Xiamen became a bastion of small and medium-size businesses, with few state-owned enterprises. It was a model in a national experiment that helped light up years of rapid growth for China.",在接下来的20年里，何立峰在厦门和附近城市担任的政府职位越来越高，直到成为地方上的党内高级干部和最高领导人。厦门则成了一个中小企业聚集的地方，国有企业很少。厦门是国家尝试市场经济实验的一个样板，帮助引领了中国经济的多年快速发展。
"Mr. He, 68, was named this month as a key government official overseeing China's economy. His appointment comes as growth is slowing and Beijing's approach has shifted decidedly back toward a reliance on state-owned enterprises and tight party supervision.",本月，现年68岁的何立峰被任命为中央政府重要官员。他受命主管经济时，中国经济增长的速度已经放缓，而北京方面已明确地转回到依赖国有企业和中共严格监督的经济模式。
"In his new role as a vice premier, Mr. He will oversee everything from industrial policy to trade negotiations. He spent the past five years as the leading central planner of China's economy, and will now have even more influence to make sure those plans and the edicts of Xi Jinping, China's top leader, are followed.",何立峰的新职位是国务院副总理，他将负责从产业政策到贸易谈判等各个方面的工作。过去五年里，他曾担任为中国经济制定总体规划的重要职务，现在，他在确保那些规划得到执行、中国最高领导人习近平的命令得到遵守方面，将拥有更大的影响力。
The big question among economists now is which Mr. He will the world see as vice premier. Will he take his cues from the entrepreneurial energy he saw early in his career in Xiamen? Or will he follow his more recent experiences as a taciturn Communist Party boss who avoids contact with foreign executives and works closely with state-owned enterprises?,经济学家们现在想知道的一个大问题是，世界将看到的何立峰会是个什么样的副总理。他会从他职业生涯早期在厦门看到的创业活力中得到启发吗?还是会按照他近年来不苟言笑的中共官员的样子行事，避免与外国高管接触、坚持与国有企业密切合作?
"Victor Shih, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, said Mr. He's recent experience suggested that he favored state-led initiatives. Such policies meet short-term needs, like the swift economic stimulus that arises from building highways and skyscrapers, but then brings difficulties, like ever-rising debt to pay for the construction.",加州大学圣迭哥分校的政治学家史宗瀚说，何立峰最近的经历表明，他支持政府主导经济。这种做法能解决短期问题，比如通过建设高速公路和盖摩天大楼来刺激经济快速发展，但会带来长期的困难，比如需要不断借钱为建设项目提供资金。
"Mr. He ""has a track record of doing things immediately, in accord with his boss's wishes, but may sacrifice some of these medium-term issues,"" Mr. Shih said.","何立峰""有按照上司的意愿马上把事情办成的记录，但可能会牺牲一些中期问题""，史宗瀚说。"
"China's new premier, Li Qiang, promised at his inaugural news conference this month that his country would treat private companies equally with state-owned enterprises, in an attempt to signal that China wanted to revive entrepreneurship. Four people who know Mr. He, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk openly, said Mr. He was influenced by his work in Xiamen and appreciated the power of free markets in fostering economic growth.",新任总理李强在本月刚上任后举行的记者会上承诺，国家将对民营企业和国有企业一视同仁，试图表明中国想重振企业家精神。四名认识何立峰的人在匿名的情况下表示，厦门的工作经历对他有影响，让他意识到了自由市场促进经济增长的力量。
"They also said, however, that they expected he would closely follow every decision by Mr. Xi, who has handed down statist measures that in many cases have suppressed business growth.",但他们也说，预计何立峰会严格按照习近平的每个决定去做。习近平已经下达的国家主义政策在许多情况下抑制了企业发展。
"Mr. He is one of the closest allies of Mr. Xi, who was confirmed this month to a third five-year term. Practically no one in China's political life has been closer to Mr. Xi over the years. The two met as young officials in Xiamen, months after Mr. He finished his master's degree at Xiamen University. When Mr. Xi ventures out in public, Mr. He consistently appears in official photos several steps behind him.",何立峰是习近平关系最密切的亲信之一，后者在本月获得了国家主席的第三个五年任期。中国政治舞台上多年来已几乎没人比何立峰与习近平的关系更近。何立峰从厦门大学拿到硕士学位几个月后，两人作为年轻官员在厦门相识。习近平在公共场合露面时，官方发布的照片中总能看到何立峰站在习近平身后几步远的地方。
"In Xiamen in the 1980s, they worked together to set up industrial parks for factories and then wined and dined potential investors from other regions of China, as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong.",20世纪80年代，他们曾在厦门一起设立工业园区，宴请来自中国大陆其他地方以及港台的潜在投资者。
"Mr. He left Xiamen in 2009 and followed Mr. Xi, who by then was China's vice president, to northeastern China. Mr. He played a senior municipal government role in Tianjin and five years later became a senior economic planner in nearby Beijing.",2009年，何立峰离开了厦门，追随担任国家副主席的习近平来到中国北方。何立峰曾在天津市政府任高级官员，五年后来到附近的北京，成为负责经济规划的主要官员。
"Since 2017, Mr. He has played a powerful role in the economy's shift toward state-led development. He served as the chairman and Communist Party secretary of the country's top central planning agency, the powerful National Development and Reform Commission. He shifted the commission's focus away from foreign investment and curtailed meetings with foreign executives, emphasizing close coordination with state-owned enterprises instead.",自2017年起，何立峰在中国经济转向由国家主导的过程中起了巨大作用。他曾担任中国最高的中央规划机构、权力极大的国家发展和改革委员会的主任兼党组书记。他改变了发改委注重外国投资的做法，减少了与外国高管的会面，转向强调与国有企业的密切协调。
"Mr. He's economic policy evolution has closely paralleled his longtime boss's declining trust in markets. Mr. He gave a speech in 2008 at his alma mater that reflected an early faith in capitalism. He extolled the decision by Mr. Deng, who dominated political life in China for two decades starting in 1978, to pursue free markets, saying he and other early graduates had ""benefited from the great cause"" of opening the economy.","何立峰在经济政策上的变化与他的老上司对市场的信任度下降同时发生。何立峰2008年在母校发表讲话时反映的是他早年对资本主义的信仰。他颂扬了邓小平1978年做出的自由市场改革决定，从那时起，邓小平主导了长达20年的中国政治生活。何立峰说，他和那些当时上了大学的人是""改革开放的直接受益者""。"
"In August, Mr. He took a very different tone in a column for the state-run Economic Daily: ""Strengthening the Party's overall leadership over economic work is the fundamental guarantee for our country's economic development. Practice has proved that the key to running China's affairs well lies in the Party.""","何立峰去年8月在政府办的《经济日报》上发表的文章语气截然不同:""加强党对经济工作的全面领导是我国经济发展的根本保证。实践证明，办好中国的事，关键在党。"""
A stark example of how far Mr. He has traveled in his policymaking can be seen in his role as a senior leader in Tianjin before moving to Beijing to run the national development commission.,何立峰在政策制定上偏离了市场经济有多远，从他被调到北京的国家发改委工作之前在天津担任高级领导人时的做法可见一斑。
"Tianjin, a large metropolis only 70 miles southeast of Beijing, is a model of government intervention in many ways the opposite of Xiamen, where Mr. He got his start. State-owned enterprises predominate. Extensive borrowing has left Tianjin facing one of China's worst local government debt crises.",位于北京东南、距北京约120公里的天津是政府干预经济的典范，在许多方面，这里与何立峰开始在政府工作时的厦门截然相反。国有企业在天津占主导地位。大量借贷让天津成为中国面临最严重债务危机的地方政府之一。
"Mr. He oversaw the construction of a vast new city of skyscrapers on the city's oceanfront. It was intended to become a ""new Manhattan,"" but has failed to attract many businesses.","何立峰曾负责在天津海滨新区建设一个由摩天大楼组成的巨大新城，将其打造为一个""新曼哈顿""，但未能吸引许多企业。"
"Today, rows of apartment buildings stand vacant at the port in Tianjin. A 103-story skyscraper opened only its bottom 40 floors for business. Even four McDonald's franchises were mostly empty on a recent workday.",如今，天津港看到的是一排排无人居住的公寓楼。一座 103层高的摩天大楼只有底部的40层投入商用。在最近的一个工作日，就算是里面的四家麦当劳特许经营店也几乎空无一人。
"David Xing, a 29-year-old office worker, sat in the food court of a mostly empty mall at lunchtime on a recent weekday. Friends had moved to Tianjin but stayed only a couple of years before concluding there were better job opportunities elsewhere.",最近一个工作日的午餐时间，29岁的上班族大卫·邢(音)坐在一家几乎空无一人的购物中心的餐饮区。他的朋友们搬到天津只住了几年就得出结论，其他地方有更好的工作机会。
"""I feel like this place can't keep people,"" he said.","""感觉这里留不住人，""他说。"
"Cities across China are struggling with overwhelming debt burdens, and an analysis by Fitch Ratings found that Tianjin was in bigger trouble than practically anywhere else. Although Tianjin is a longtime center of heavy industry with a broad tax base, the city's borrowing affiliates are so indebted that they pay among the highest interest rates in China. Nearly three-fifths of Tianjin's debt falls due this year, and investors have been leery of extending long-term loans to the city.",中国各地的城市都在艰难地应对沉重的债务问题，惠誉评级的一项分析发现，天津的麻烦比所有其他城市的都大。尽管这里长期以来一直是重工业中心，有广泛的税收基础，但由于附属于该市的借贷机构的负债如此之高，以至于它们支付的利率位居中国最高之列。天津近五分之三的债务今年到期，投资者对于向该市提供期限更长的贷款一直持谨慎态度。
"Unlike Tianjin, Xiamen has fairly little debt. An analysis released this month by S&P Global found that Xiamen was the least indebted city in Fujian Province, which in turn had one of the best provincial credit profiles in China.",与天津不同，厦门的债务相当少。标准普尔全球本月发布的一项分析发现，厦门是福建省负债最少的城市，福建则是中国信用状况最好的省份之一。
"Xiamen also remains a hub of small-business activity. Sun Hao, 40, moved to Xiamen 15 years ago when he grew tired of working for others in his home province, Henan, in central China. He opened his one-man welding workshop, where he makes steel mountings for a nearby circuit board factory.",厦门仍然是小企业活动的中心。现年40岁的孙浩(音) 15年前从河南来到厦门，因为他不想继续在自己的老家为他人工作。他在这里开了一家只有他一个人的电焊坊，为附近的电路板厂制造钢支架。
"""I used to work for others, but here I can do it on my own, which feels better,"" he said.","""以前跟别人做，我在这里自己做，就更好一点，""他说。"
"But China today is much more like Tianjin than Xiamen. Nationwide, government investment in road, bridges and other infrastructure grew nearly three times as fast in the first two months of this year as did retail, a sector that is among the most dominated by entrepreneurs in China.",但今天的中国更像天津而不是厦门。全国范围内，今年头两个月政府在道路、桥梁和其他基础设施上的投资增长速度几乎是零售业的三倍，零售业是中国企业家最多的行业之一。
"Mr. He himself may never have absorbed Xiamen's small-business ethos. Even before he moved to Tianjin, he spent his last years in Xiamen ordering the flattening of neighborhoods and villages on the outskirts of Xiamen's historic core to make way for modern buildings, said Alfred Wu, a politics professor at the National University of Singapore who used to work as a local journalist near Xiamen.",何立峰本人也许从未理解厦门的小企业精神。甚至在他去天津工作之前，在厦门政府任职的最后几年里，他曾下令将厦门历史老城周边的社区和村庄夷为平地，为现代化建筑腾地，曾在厦门附近任地方记者的新加坡国立大学政治学教授吴木銮说道。
"Mr. He finished his years in Xiamen, Mr. Wu added, with a new nickname: He Dachai, or He the Big Demolisher.",吴木銮补充说，何立峰结束他的厦门职业生涯时获得了一个新绰号:何大拆。
"The 30 women sat in wooden chairs, facing each other in a rectangular formation. At the front of the room was the ruling Communist Party's hammer and sickle logo, with a sign declaring the meeting's purpose: ""Symposium of unmarried young women of the right age.""","30名女性面对面坐在木椅上，围成一个长方形。房间正面有执政党中国共产党的锤子镰刀标志，还有一条横幅宣告会议的目的:""适龄未婚女青年座谈会""。"
"Officials in Daijiapu, a town in southeast China, had gathered the women to sign a public pledge to reject high ""bride prices,"" referring to a wedding custom in which the man gives money to his future wife's family as a condition of engagement. The local government, describing the event earlier this year in a notice on its website, said it hoped people would abandon such backward customs and do their part to ""start a new civilized trend.""","中国东南部戴家埔乡的官员们召集这些女性签署了一份公开承诺，抵制高价""彩礼""。这是指一种婚礼习俗，男方要向未来妻子的家人付钱，以作为订婚条件。今年早些时候，当地政府在其网站上的一则通知中描述了这件事，并希望人们摒弃这种落后的习俗，为""移风易俗""尽自己的一份力量。"
"As China faces a shrinking population, officials are cracking down on an ancient tradition of betrothal gifts to try to promote marriages, which have been on the decline. Known in Mandarin as caili, the payments have skyrocketed across the country in recent years averaging $20,000 in some provinces making marriage increasingly unaffordable. The payments are typically paid by the groom's parents.",随着中国面临人口萎缩，官员们正在打击古老的彩礼传统，试图提振不断下滑的结婚率。近年来，全国各地的彩礼费用飙升，在一些省份平均为14万元，这使得人们越来越难以负担结婚的费用。这些费用通常由新郎的父母支付。
"To curb the practice, local governments have rolled out propaganda campaigns such as the Daijiapu event, instructing unmarried women not to compete with one another in demanding the highest prices. Some town officials have imposed caps on caili or even directly intervened in private negotiations between families.",为了遏制这种行为，地方政府开展了宣传活动，戴家埔的活动也是其中一例，它们指导未婚女性不要相互攀比着要求最高规格的彩礼。一些乡镇官员对彩礼设置上限，甚至直接干预家庭之间的私下谈判。
"The tradition has been met with growing public resistance as attitudes have shifted. Among more educated Chinese, particularly in cities, many are likely to see it as a patriarchal relic that treats women as property being sold to another household. In the rural areas where the custom tends to be more common, it has also fallen out of favor among poor farmers who must save several years of income or go into debt to get married.",随着公众观念的转变，该传统已经遭到了越来越多的抵制。在受教育程度较高的中国人中，尤其是在城市里，许多人可能认为这是一种父权制的遗留，即将女性视为财产，出售给另一个家庭。在农村地区，这种习俗往往更为普遍，然而它在贫穷的农民中也不受欢迎，因为他们必须积攒数年的收入，或者借债才能结婚。
"Even so, the government's campaign has drawn criticism as reinforcing sexist stereotypes of women. Chinese media outlets, in describing the problem of rising marriage payments, have often depicted women who seek big sums as being greedy.",即便如此，政府的宣传活动还是遭到了批评，称其强化了对女性的性别偏见。中国媒体在论及结婚费用上涨的问题时经常称追求高额彩礼的女性贪财。
"After the Daijiapu event went viral on social media, a flurry of commenters questioned why the burden of solving the problem fell on women. Some commenters urged officials to convene similar meetings for men to teach them how to be more equal partners in marriage.",戴家埔的活动在社交媒体上疯传后，大量评论人士质疑，为什么解决问题的负担落在了女性身上。一些评论人士敦促官员们为男性召开类似的会议，教他们如何在婚姻中成为更平等的伴侣。
"In China, ""as with most state policies regarding marriage, women are the central target,"" said Goncalo Santos, an anthropology professor who studies rural China at the University of Coimbra, in Portugal. ""It's a paternalistic appeal to women to maintain social order and harmony, to fulfill their roles as wives and mothers.""","在中国，""就像大多数关于婚姻的国家政策一样，女性是中心目标，""葡萄牙科英布拉大学研究中国农村的人类学教授贡萨洛·桑托斯说。""这是一种家长式的呼吁，要求女性维护社会秩序与和谐，履行自己作为妻子和母亲的角色。"""
"By targeting women, official campaigns like the Daijiapu event sidestep the fact that the problem is partly of the government's own making. During the four decades of the one-child policy, parents often preferred sons, resulting in a lopsided gender ratio that has intensified competition for wives.",像戴家埔这样以女性为目标的官方活动回避了一个事实——问题在一定程度上是政府自己造成的。在实施独生子女政策的40年里，父母往往更想要儿子，导致性别比例失衡，加剧了对妻子的争夺。
"The imbalance is most pronounced in rural areas, where there are now 19 million more men than women. Many rural women prefer to marry men in cities to obtain an urban household registration permit, or hukou, which provides access to better schools, housing and health care.",这种不平衡在农村地区最为明显，那里的男性比女性多1900万。许多农村女性更愿意嫁给城市男性，以获得城市户口，从而获得更好的教育资源、住房和医疗保健。
"Poorer men in rural areas must pay more to marry because the women's families want a stronger guarantee that they can provide for their daughters, a move that instead could plunge them deeper into poverty.",农村地区较贫穷的男性必须支付更多的结婚费用，因为女性的家庭希望他们能够为女儿提供更强有力的保障，而此举可能会让男性家庭陷入更深的贫困。
"""This has broken many families,"" said Yuying Tong, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""The parents spend all their money and go financially bankrupt just to find a wife for their son.""","""这让许多家庭破裂，""香港中文大学社会学教授同钰莹说。""父母花光了所有的钱，甚至破产，就为了给儿子找个老婆。"""
"Officials have acknowledged their limited ability to eliminate a custom that many families see as a marker of social status. In rural areas, neighbors may gossip about women who command low prices, questioning whether something is wrong with them, according to researchers who study the custom.",官员们承认，该习俗被许多家庭视为社会地位的标志，他们移风易俗的能力有限。据研究该习俗的人士称，在农村地区，邻居们可能会对那些要价低的女性说三道四，质疑她们是否有什么问题。
"The tradition is also linked to entrenched attitudes about the role of women as caregivers in families. In parts of rural China, the payment is still seen as a purchase of the bride's labor and fertility from her parents, researchers say. Once married, the woman has typically been expected to move in with her husband's family, get pregnant and be responsible for housework, child raising and the care of her in-laws.",这一传统也同女性在家庭中扮演照顾者角色这一根深蒂固的观念有关。研究人员说，在中国农村的部分地区，彩礼仍被视为从新娘的父母那里购买新娘的劳动和生育能力。一旦结婚，女性通常会搬到夫家，怀上孩子、负责家务、抚养孩子和照顾公婆。
"But as the soaring cost of living has exposed gaps in China's social safety net, securing a high marriage payment can be a way for lower-income families with daughters to build savings for unexpected medical bills or other emergencies. And with parents living longer, some women are demanding higher prices as reimbursement for being the primary caregivers of the older generation, researchers say.",但是，随着生活成本的飙升暴露出中国社会保障网络的漏洞，对于有女儿的低收入家庭来说，通过婚姻获得一大笔钱可能是一种攒钱的方式，以便应对意外的医疗费用或其他紧急情况。研究人员说，随着父母寿命的延长，一些女性要求支付更高的费用，作为令她们成为老一代主要照顾者的补偿。
Sociologists say a more effective way for the government to curb the tradition would be to put more funding toward child care and into health care for seniors.,社会学家表示，要想遏制这一传统，政府更有效的方法是向儿童保育和老年人的医疗保健投入更多资金。
"As more young Chinese delay or shun marriage altogether, their parents' expectations around marriage payments are shifting, said Liu Guoying, 58, a matchmaker in Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi Province, which is notorious for bride prices that can exceed $50,000.",58岁的刘国英(音)是南昌市的一名媒人，她说，随着越来越多的中国年轻人推迟结婚或完全不结婚，父母对彩礼的期望正在发生变化。南昌是江西省省会，该省以彩礼高昂而闻名，有时超过35万元。
"Parents eager to facilitate a smooth start to the marriage are increasingly passing the payment to the newlyweds as a gift, she said. Some parents so desperately want their daughters to be married, she said, that they are willing to settle for less cash as long as the prospective sons-in-law treats their children well.",她说，越来越多的父母为了让婚姻有个顺利的开始，会把钱作为礼物送给新婚夫妇。她说，一些父母非常希望自己的女儿能出嫁，只要未来的女婿对自己的孩子好，他们愿意少要点钱。
"""Pity the hearts of the parents of the world,"" Ms. Liu said.","""可怜天下父母心，""刘国英说。"
"A new generation of women, more educated than their parents, may also be playing a role in changing attitudes around the issue. A 2020 survey of around 2,000 people in China found that highly educated couples were less likely to pay bride prices, believing that loving each other was enough.",新一代女性受教育程度比父母高，可能也在改变人们对这个问题的态度方面发挥了作用。2020年，中国一项针对约2000人的调查发现，学历越高，送出或收到彩礼的比例越低，他们认为两个人相爱就好。
"But even for women like Luki Chan, 27, who went to college, an opportunity her mother never had, escaping the pressure of hometown traditions can be difficult.",但即使对于像27岁的露琪·陈(音)这样上过大学——她的母亲从未有过这样的机会——的女性来说，要摆脱老家习俗的压力也很不容易，
"Ms. Chan grew up in a mountainous region of Fujian, a province in southeast China where marriage payments are often high. Her mother expects to receive at least $14,000 from the groom when Ms. Chan gets married, she said, as repayment for the money she spent on her schooling.",陈女士在中国东南省份福建的山区长大，那里的彩礼往往很高。她母亲对彩礼的期望值不少于10万，希望能把读书花的钱补回来。
"Now, Ms. Chan is building her own career in Shanghai as a theater producer and is in the process of registering for marriage documents with her Taiwanese boyfriend. Ms. Chan fears that when her parents find out, their demands for a bride price will ultimately prevail. Ms. Chan rejects the tradition, regarding it as tantamount to being sold.",现在，陈女士在上海从事戏剧制作人的工作，并且正在与来自台湾的男友办理结婚手续。她担心若是父母知晓这件事，恐怕会坚持索要彩礼。陈女士很反感这样的习俗，感觉这就像自己被卖掉。
"""When I see the patriarchal system that exploits women, and the misogynistic marriage customs, I am very scared to discuss marriage with my family,"" she said.","""看到重男轻女的制度和婚姻习俗，我很害怕跟家里人讲我结婚的事，""她说。"
Officials see the lavish payments as an urgent problem that could hinder economic development and trigger social instability.,官员们认为，高额彩礼是一个紧迫的问题，可能会阻碍经济发展，并引发社会的不稳定。
"Across the country, cities are trying to popularize the idea of getting engaged without exchanging money. This month, local officials in Nanchang hosted a free mass wedding for 100 couples who got married simultaneously inside a huge sports stadium, touting the slogan ""We Want Happiness, Not Bride Price.""","中国各地的城市都在努力推广不收彩礼的理念。本月，南昌的地方官员在一个巨大的体育场为百对新人举办了一场免费的集体婚礼，宣传口号是""不要彩礼要幸福""。"
"The couples wore red and gold traditional Chinese wedding outfits, performing the ceremony in a synchronized choreography. Their relatives watched from the bleachers, with local government officials getting the prime seats.",新人们穿着红色和金色的中国传统婚礼服装，同时举行结婚仪式。他们的亲属坐在看台上，政府官员则占据着主宾位置。
"But in a sign of how much the custom still persists, dozens of residents across China in the past year have complained to local officials in online message boards about exorbitant marriage payments.",在过去一年里，有数十名民众在政府的网络留言板上抱怨高价彩礼的问题，可见这样的习俗在民间仍然盛行。
"In one post last summer, a resident said he was ""begging"" his local government to regulate marriage payments in his rural village of Baixiang in southwest China, where many farmers live in poverty.","在去年夏天的一个帖子里，来自西南部柏香村的民众留言，""恳求""当地政府整治彩礼问题。当地有许多农民生活在贫困中。"
"Three weeks later, county officials replied that they had sent a team of investigators to interrogate the resident's girlfriend at her home. She told investigators that her parents agreed to marry her off for about $40,000 and refused her pleas to lower the price. The boyfriend's family had paid only half of it so far.",三周后，县里的官员回复，他们已经派了调查组到该居民的女朋友家里进行调查了解。她告诉调查人员，她的父母约定的聘金约30万元，并拒绝了她不要收那么高彩礼的请求。到目前为止，男方仅付了一半的钱。
"After ""great efforts on all sides,"" officials said, the girlfriend's father agreed to a payment of about $9,000 and returned the rest to the boyfriend's family. The refund took place at the local Communist Party bureau, with party officials as witnesses.","官员们说，通过""多方努力""，女友的父亲同意收7万元，退还超出部分。退还彩礼是在当地党支部进行的，有党官员在一旁见证。"
"The officials concluded their report with a message for the couple: ""Wishing you a happy life!""","官方在回复的最后祝福这对夫妇:""祝您生活愉快!"""
"The authorities in China have raided the Beijing office of the Mintz Group, an American corporate investigations firm, and detained all five of its Chinese employees, the company said on Friday.",美国企业调查公司美思明智集团(Mintz Group)上周五表示，中国当局突击搜查了它的北京办事处，并拘留了全部五名中国员工。
Mintz Group said in a statement that the authorities closed its operations in Beijing. The company has not been able to contact the employees since they were taken away.,美思明智集团在一份声明中表示，当局关闭了其在北京的业务。员工被带走后，公司一直无法与他们取得联系。
"It was unclear what the authorities' objectives were in investigating the company, and the government did not respond to a request for comment. But the move highlighted the risks that firms involved in due diligence face in China as Xi Jinping, the country's top leader, has repeatedly called for a greater emphasis on security and has tightened the ruling Communist Party's grip on information.",目前尚不清楚当局调查该公司的目的，政府也没有回应置评请求。在中国最高领导人习近平一再呼吁进一步强调安全，并加强了执政的共产党对信息的控制之际，此举突显了参与尽职调查的公司在中国面临的风险。
"""We can confirm that Chinese authorities have detained the five staff in Mintz Group's Beijing office, all of them Chinese nationals, and have closed our operations there,"" Mintz said in a statement. The Chinese nationals were detained on Monday, said two people familiar with the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of legal sensitivities.","""我们可以确认，中国当局已经拘留了美思明智集团北京办事处的五名员工，并关闭了我们在那里的业务，五名员工均为中国公民，""该集团在一份声明中说。两名知情人士表示，这些中国公民于上周一被拘留;出于法律敏感性，他们要求匿名。"
"The Mintz Group, which is based in New York, does due diligence work background checks, asset tracing, and fraud and corruption investigations for companies before they make acquisitions or other large investments. The company says it has over 450 investigators in 18 offices around the world.",总部位于纽约的美思明智集团在企业进行收购或其他大型投资之前为他们进行尽职调查工作，包括背景调查、资产追踪以及欺诈和腐败调查。该集团表示，它在全球18个办事处拥有超过450名调查员。
"Such work has been the target of the Chinese authorities in the past. In 2013, the Shanghai authorities arrested a British investigator, Peter Humphrey, and his wife and business partner, Yu Yingzeng, an American. They had operated a corporate investigations firm, ChinaWhys, that also did due diligence for multinationals.",过去，此类工作一直是中国当局的目标。2013年，上海当局逮捕了英国调查员韩飞龙(Peter Humphrey)及其美籍妻子兼商业伙伴虞英曾。他们经营中慧公司(ChinaWhys)，这是一家企业调查公司，也为跨国公司进行尽职调查。
Both were charged with violating the rights of private citizens by obtaining private information about them. Each spent two years in prison before being allowed to leave China.,两人都被指控通过获取公民的私人信息侵犯了这些公民的权利。二人均在监狱服刑两年后获准离开中国。
"Even as China tightens security policies, Beijing officials have also been trying to persuade foreign companies to resume investing. China almost completely closed its borders for nearly three years during the pandemic but lifted its ""zero Covid"" policies in early December and began reopening its borders in early January.","即便中国在收紧安全政策，北京官员一直还在努力说服外国公司恢复投资。中国在三年的大流行期间几乎完全关闭边境，但在12月初取消了""清零""政策，并在1月初开始重新开放边境。"
News of the raid came as an annual gathering of multinational chief executives and senior Chinese government officials known as the China Development Forum was set to open on Saturday. Chinese economic policymakers have been hoping that the gathering would be a chance to re-establish international investment confidence in China.,"突击搜查的消息传出之际正值""中国发展高层论坛""前夕，这场跨国公司首席执行官和中国政府高级官员的年度聚会于周六开幕。中国的经济决策者一直希望此次会议能成为重塑国际对中国投资信心的机会。"
"Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, and Ray Dalio, who founded the world's biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates and retired late last year, are scheduled to attend the forum.",苹果公司首席执行官库克和去年年底退休的全球最大对冲基金桥水基金创始人雷·达里奥将出席论坛。
"But few other prominent American executives are scheduled to attend or speak at the forum this year. Many American companies have become worried about getting caught between pressure from the Chinese government to express support, and pressure from Congress to show that they are standing up to Beijing on issues like human rights, and have gone silent.",但没有多少其他著名的美国高管计划参加今年的论坛或在论坛上发言。许多美国公司担心处于两难境地而保持沉默，一方面面临中国政府要求表达支持的压力，另一方面，国会要求他们在人权等问题上展现与北京对立的立场。
"In late 1978, China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping set in motion two major policy shifts that would change China and the world order in the decades to come. At a Communist Party meeting in December of that year, the leadership declared that China would turn its focus from political struggle to economic development. Within days, China and the United States announced that they would establish diplomatic relations.",1978年底，中国当时的最高领导人邓小平启动了两项重大的政策转变，此举将在未来几十年里改变中国和世界秩序。在1978年12月召开的三中全会上，中共领导层宣布政府的重心将从政治斗争转向经济发展。没过几天，中国和美国宣布建立外交关系。
These two events marked the end of China as a hermit country where one billion people lived in extreme poverty and the start of its evolution into a superpower.,这两件事标志着中国结束了让十亿人生活在极端贫困中的封闭状态，开始了它向超级大国发展的进程。
"It was no coincidence that the country's economic reform and opening up to the outside world went hand in hand. ""China cannot develop in isolation from the world,"" Mr. Deng declared.","中国的经济改革与对外开放同时开始不是巧合。""中国的发展离不开世界，""邓小平宣称。"
"Now both policies are in jeopardy. China's current paramount leader, Xi Jinping, who has just started his third term as the nation's president, has reversed many of the policies that propelled China's economic rise. During his visit to Moscow this week, Mr. Xi also aligned his country closer to Russia while alienating countries that helped China develop over the past four decades.",现在这两项政策都面临威胁。中国现任最高领导人习近平刚开始他的第三个国家主席任期，他已经逆转了许多推动中国经济崛起的政策。在本周访问莫斯科期间，习近平进一步拉近了中俄关系，同时疏远了在过去四十年里对中国发展起到过帮助作用的国家。
"The prospect of international isolation unnerves many people in China. They worry that China has landed itself in the ""wrong"" camp, just as it did after the Communist Party took over the country in 1949 and joined the Soviet bloc, only to have a falling-out, and then a border clash, with the Soviet Union.","在国际上受孤立的前景让许多中国人感到不安。他们担心中国加入了""错误""阵营，就像中共1949年掌权后与苏联结盟那样，只不过后来中苏失和，还发生了边界冲突。"
"With Mr. Xi's visit, China has made it clear to the world which side it has chosen. It has also made it much easier for the United States to persuade American allies to join efforts in containing China.",通过对俄罗斯进行国事访问，习近平向世界表明中国选择了哪一边。这也让美国更容易说服盟友加入遏制中国的努力。
"""The fault line between the two camps is becoming increasingly sharper,"" Hu Wei, a political scholar based in Shanghai, said in an interview. ""I have long said that if China cannot make a flexible choice in the Russia-Ukraine war, it will be further isolated.""","""两大阵营的分化越来越清晰，""上海的政治学者胡伟在接受采访时说。""早就说如果中国在俄乌战争上不能做出一个有灵活性的选择的话，中国就会被更加孤立。"""
"Immediately after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, Mr. Hu, in a commentary, criticized China's position on the war. He predicted that the West would be more united, NATO would continue to expand and China could become an international pariah if it didn't distance itself from Russia. His article was censored within China.",去年，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后不久，胡伟在一篇评论文章中批评了中国在这场战争中的立场。他预测西方将更加团结，北约会继续扩张，如果中国不与俄罗斯保持距离的话，有可能会在国际上受到进一步孤立。他的文章在中国国内遭到了审查。
"The ""Iron Curtain"" would ""fall again not only from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, but also to the final confrontation between the Western-dominated camp and its competitors,"" he wrote. ""If China does not take proactive measures to respond, it will encounter further containment from the U.S. and the West.""","""'铁幕'再次落下，不仅是从波罗的海到黑海，而且将形成西方主导的阵营与其竞争者的最后对决，""，他写道。""中国如果不采取措施积极应变，将遭遇美国和西方的进一步围堵。"""
"That's already happening. In a recent speech, Mr. Xi criticized Western countries for their ""all-around containment, encirclement and suppression of China"" led by the United States. He said that it ""has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country's development.""","这种围堵已经在发生。习近平在最近一次讲话中批评以美国为首的西方国家对中国""实施了全方位的遏制、围堵、打压，给我国发展带来前所未有的严峻挑战""。"
"China is experiencing sharp drops in both export and foreign direct investment, as many multinational companies move some or all of their supply chains out of China. The country's economic policy has become much more unpredictable under Mr. Xi, especially during the ""zero Covid"" lockdowns last year. And the combination of American trade tariffs and export controls has made navigating China tricky for multinational businesses.","随着许多跨国公司将部分或全部供应链迁出中国，它正经历出口和外国直接投资的急剧下降。在习近平的领导下，中国的经济政策已变得更加难以预测，尤其是在新冠""清零""政策导致去年多座城市封城期间。美国对中国商品加征关税以及对华出口管制，使跨国企业在中国的发展变得更加困难。"
"The Biden administration has been trying to persuade others to coordinate on its China policies, especially in blocking access to advanced technologies. U.S. allies, including Japan and the Netherlands, have pledged not to sell their most advanced semiconductor machinery to China. The United Kingdom, after wavering for a while on the infrastructure backbone of its 5G build out, decided against buying equipment from Huawei.",在对华政策方面，拜登政府一直试图说服其他国家与美国进行统筹协调，尤其是在阻止中国获取先进技术上。包括日本、荷兰在内的美国盟友已承诺不向中国出售它们最先进的半导体设备。英国曾在本国5G网络基础设施建设上使用哪个厂家的骨干网犹豫了一段时间，最后决定不购买华为的设备。
"""The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have reinforced the negative perception of China within the European Union,"" a group of Chinese researchers wrote in a report. ""China's image in Europe is implicated by its association with Russia.""","""新冠疫情以及俄乌冲突强化了欧盟对中国的负面认知，""中国的一组研究人员在一份报告中写道。""中国在欧洲的形象受到俄罗斯的牵连。"""
"Liberal-minded Chinese whisper in private that China's refusal to condemn Russia's invasion, and Mr. Xi's friendship with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, have both made alliance building by the United States much easier and made their own lives much tougher.",持自由派想法的中国人私下嘀咕，中国拒绝谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，以及习近平与俄罗斯总统普京的友谊不仅让美国建立盟友关系变得更加容易，也使得自己的生活变得更加艰难。
"Chinese businesspeople have found it hard to expand in the West, since many countries have enacted strict rules regarding Chinese investment. Manufacturers have had to move parts of their supply chains outside the country if they want to retain Western clients working to reduce their exposure to China. Many Chinese workers have lost their jobs as a result.",中国商人发现很难向西方扩张，因为许多国家都对来自中国的投资制定了严格规定。中国的制造商们如果想保住正在流失的西方客户——后者正在努力减少因中国因素导致的风险，就不得不将部分供应链转移到国外。许多中国工人已因此失业。
"Chinese tech companies are facing significant scrutiny. Citing national security concerns, the U.S. government is pushing ByteDance, the Chinese internet company, to sell TikTok, its popular short-video app, or face a ban in the country. The U.S. has already banned its use on government devices, as have Canada, Britain and EU nations. TikTok's chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, is scheduled to testify in Congress today.",中国的科技企业正面临极为严格的审查。美国政府以国家安全为由，要求中国互联网公司字节跳动出售其持有的短视频应用TikTok的股份，否则这款广受欢迎的应用将面临在美国被禁的前景。美国已经禁止在政府设备上使用TikTok，加拿大、英国和欧盟国家也下达了类似禁令。TikTok首席执行官周受资今天将在美国国会作证。
"Feng Yujun, a professor and a top Russia expert at Fudan University in Shanghai, argued in a speech in December that China has paid too much, economically and politically, for its ties with Russia, according to a transcript of his speech.",据文字记录，上海复旦大学教授、俄罗斯问题专家冯玉军在去年12月的一个讲话中指出，中国与俄罗斯历史上的三次结盟都以中国付出了惨重经济和政治代价结束。
"""We not only need to maintain a long-term friendly cooperative relationship with Russia but also need to maintain a constructive partnership with the United States, because our relationship with the U.S. will determine China's overall international environment in the future,"" he said.","""我们既要和俄罗斯保持一个长期睦邻友好的合作伙伴关系，更要和美国保持一个建设性的伙伴关系，因为和美国的关系决定了中国未来的整体国际环境，""他说。"
"Mr. Xi has rapidly been changing the direction Mr. Deng laid out. He did not follow the former leader's guidance that China bide its time and hide its capabilities while developing itself. Instead, Mr. Xi bragged about China's tech power when nearly all of it was built atop Western technologies.","习近平已在迅速改变邓小平制定的方向。他没有遵循邓小平关于中国在发展道路上要""韬光养晦""的教导，反而在中国的技术产品几乎全部依赖西方技术时吹嘘中国的技术实力。"
"He also has turned China's cooperative diplomats into confrontational warriors on the international stage. Under him, the Chinese government has repeatedly tried to used its economic weight to coerce any company or any government that dared to criticize it.","他还把曾与外界合作的中国外交官们变成了国际舞台上的""战狼""。在他的领导下，中国政府一再试图利用本国的经济影响力来胁迫任何敢于批评它的公司或政府。"
"Mr. Deng was once asked why China attached such importance to its relationship with the United States. He replied, ""Looking back over the past few decades, every country that has had good relations with the U.S. has become prosperous,"" according to a memoir by a top expert on the United States, Li Shenzhi, a well-known liberal intellectual.","据研究美国问题的顶级专家、著名自由主义知识分子李慎之的回忆录，有人曾问邓小平，中国为何如此重视中美关系。邓小平回答说，""回头看看这几十年来，凡是和美国搞好关系的国家，都富起来了。"""
"Under Mr. Xi, Chinese relations with the United States have turned antagonistic. By contrast, he calls Mr. Putin a ""dear friend"" and seeks to strengthen economic ties with Russia, whose output is close to that of Guangdong Province in southern China and with whom China had a bitter, humiliating history during both the Imperial and Communist periods.","在习近平的领导下，中美关系已变成敌对关系。与之形成鲜明对比，习近平称普京为""亲爱的朋友""，寻求加强与俄罗斯的经济关系，而俄罗斯的经济产出只接近于中国南方的广东省，在俄罗斯帝国和苏联共产主义时期，中国都经历过对方导致的痛苦与屈辱。"
"Mr. Hu, the scholar, said in the interview that it was not true that the U.S. had always tried to contain China. The U.S. let China into the World Trade Organization. It increased trade with China. It provided technologies and management expertise when China had nothing. Why did the U.S.-China relations turn sour? he asked. Who should be responsible?",胡伟在接受采访时表示，美国总是试图遏制中国的说法不正确。美国同意让中国加入世界贸易组织。美国增加了与中国的贸易。在中国一无所有的时候，美国提供了技术和管理方面的专业知识。他问道，中美关系为什么恶化?谁应该对此负责?
"""I won't discuss this because it's a sensitive issue,"" he said. ""I don't think the responsibility lies with the U.S.""","""这个我不讨论了，因为这个问题太敏感。我认为责任不在美国。"""
"He says that China has no reason to complain that the United States doesn't help it anymore. ""Why should I help you if we are no longer friends?"" he asked. ""Isn't it foolish to help make your competitor stronger?""","他说，中国没有理由抱怨美国不再帮助自己了。""我们都不是朋友了我为什么还要帮你呢?""他问道。""把竞争对手给弄大，那不是傻瓜吗?"""
"In the end, foreign policy decisions should be made based on whether they help China achieve modernization and improve people's lives, said Mr. Hu not whether a leader likes a certain foreign country or not.",胡伟表示，外交政策归根结底应该在是否有助于中国实现现代化、有助于改善人民生活的基础上做出，而不是领导人喜不喜欢某个国家。
"For the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine, Mr. Hu wrote a follow-up article. He asked whether Mr. Putin would still have gone ahead with his ""special military operation"" if he had known how it would turn out.","胡伟在乌克兰战争一周年之际写了一篇后续文章。他在文章中问道，""如果普京当初知道'特别军事行动'是这样一种结局，他还会做出这样的选择吗?"""
"""History does not entertain 'what ifs,' and what is lost can never be regained,"" he wrote. ""We can only learn from the lessons, try our best to not cling obstinately to our course and to never repeat past mistakes.""","""但历史没有'如果'，失去的将无法挽回，""他写道。""唯一只能吸取教训，切勿一意孤行，切忌重蹈覆辙。"""
"He concluded: ""What is the most tragic is to witness a nation that does not remember its past mistakes.""","他在文章结尾处写道:""一个民族不长记性，这才是最可悲的!"""
"His article was about Russia, but he might as well have been talking about China.",他的这句话是对俄罗斯说的，但也可用于中国。
"China has for the first time approved a Covid-19 vaccine based on mRNA technology, greenlighting a homegrown shot months after the ruling Communist Party eliminated its strict pandemic restrictions.",在执政的中共取消了对新冠大流行的严格限制数月之后，中国批准了首个基于mRNA技术的新冠疫苗，为国产mRNA疫苗开了绿灯。
"China has long refused to use the foreign-made mRNA shots that were crucial in easing the pandemic in many parts of the world and that the United States first authorized for emergency use in December 2020. Beijing chose instead to promote its own pharmaceutical firms, first in rolling out a more traditional but less effective Covid vaccine, and later, in the pursuit of a homegrown mRNA, or messenger RNA, vaccine.",长期以来，中国一直拒绝使用外国制造的mRNA疫苗。这种疫苗对于缓解世界许多地区的大流行病至关重要，美国在2020年12月首次授权紧急使用。北京反而选择了本土药企的疫苗，首先是采用传统技术但效果较差的疫苗，后来又寻求国产mRNA(信使核糖核酸)疫苗。
"China's new mRNA vaccine, developed by CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd., based in the northern Chinese city of Shijiazhuang, was approved for emergency use by China's health regulator, according to a statement from the company on Wednesday.",石药集团有限公司周三发表声明称，该公司开发的新型mRNA疫苗已被中国卫生监管机构纳入紧急使用。该公司总部位于北部城市石家庄。
"Among the vaccines currently available in China, the most widely known are made by the companies Sinopharm and Sinovac. Like other traditional vaccines, they rely on a century-old method for inoculation, which use an inactivated virus to trigger a response by the immune system, and have since proven to be less effective in protecting against symptomatic disease.",在中国目前可用的疫苗中，最广为人知的是国药集团和科兴生物公司生产的疫苗。与其他传统疫苗一样，它们基于有着百年历史的接种预防方法，使用灭活病毒来触发免疫系统的反应，后来已被证明，这种疫苗在预防有症状的疾病方面效果较差。
"The mRNA vaccines use a genetic molecule that assists cells to make proteins that can set off an immune response in the body. While new variants of Covid-19 are increasingly evasive to both traditional and new vaccines, the mRNA technology allows scientists to quickly modify shots to target the new strains.",mRNA疫苗使用一种遗传分子来帮助细胞制造可以在体内引发免疫反应的蛋白质。尽管新冠的新变种对传统疫苗和新疫苗有越来越强的免疫逃逸，但mRNA技术使科学家能够针对新毒株快速修改疫苗。
"The new Chinese vaccine comes at a time when the party and its leader, Xi Jinping, are trying to jump-start an economy that had been hurt by some of the harshest Covid-19 restrictions in the world. This month, China reopened its borders to foreign travelers for the first time since 2020, at the start of the pandemic.",新的中国疫苗出现之际，中共及其领导人习近平正试图重振因世界上最严格的新冠限制措施而受到重创的经济。本月，中国对外国游客重新开放边境，这是自2020年疫情暴发之初以来的首次。
"For much of the pandemic, Chinese residents lived under the country's ""zero Covid"" policy, when unpredictable lockdowns left tens of millions of residents unable to leave their homes for weeks at a time. In major cities, P.C.R. testing was required every one to three days to enter any public space.","在大流行的大部分时间里，中国民众生活在""清零""政策之下，每一次无法预测的封锁都导致数以千万计的民众数周无法出门。在主要城市，民众为了进入公共场所，需要每隔一到三天进行一次核酸检测。"
"The government's efforts to eradicate Covid were effective at keeping infections at bay, but they led to factory disruptions, job losses and a plunge in consumer spending. The strict restrictions triggered nationwide protests last November, the biggest challenge to Mr. Xi's authority since he became president in 2013.",政府根除新冠病毒的努力有效地遏制了感染，但也导致工厂停工、失业和消费者支出大幅下降。去年11月，这些严格的限制引发了全国范围的抗议，这是自习近平2013年成为国家主席以来对其权威的最大挑战。
"China's handling of pandemic has come under broader scrutiny as well, with the country facing renewed criticism over its efforts to thwart investigations into the origins of the pandemic. Last week, the World Health Organization accused Chinese officials of withholding research that may link the virus's origin to wild animals, asking why the data had not been made available three years ago and why it has now disappeared.",中国对大流行病的处理也受到了更广泛的审视，它因阻挠对大流行病起源的调查而招致新一轮批评。上周，世界卫生组织指责中国官员隐瞒可能将病毒起源与野生动物联系起来的研究，并质疑为什么三年前没有提供这些数据，以及为什么数据现在消失了。
"With little warning, officials ended the ""zero Covid"" policy in early December, removing mass testing booths and pandemic protocols virtually overnight.","在几乎没有任何预兆的情况下，官员们在12月初结束了""清零""政策，大规模核酸检测点和防疫措施几乎在一夜之间取消。"
"A Covid outbreak quickly swept the country and overwhelmed ill-prepared hospitals, with deadly consequences. The official death toll in China for the entire pandemic is around 83,000 people. Epidemiologists widely believe the number to be a severe undercount, estimating the true toll to be 1 million to 1.5 million people.",新冠疫情迅速席卷全国，准备不足的医院不堪重负，造成了致命后果。中国官方公布的整个大流行死亡人数约为8.3万人。流行病学家普遍认为，这个数字被严重低估了，他们估计真正的死亡人数在100万至150万人之间。
"At the height of the Covid wave, some mainland residents ventured across the border to the Chinese territory of Macau to find foreign-made mRNA vaccines. During this time, China also began to widely distribute Pfizer's Paxlovid, an oral treatment found to significantly cut the risk of hospitalization and death.",在新冠疫情最严重的时候，一些大陆居民冒险出境，到中国领土澳门寻求接种外国制造的mRNA疫苗。在此期间，中国也开始广泛销售辉瑞的Paxlovid，这是一种口服治疗药物，被发现可以显著降低住院和死亡风险。
"As Covid infections recede, many Chinese residents have said they are eager to travel and resume their prepandemic routines. Domestic tourism is booming, and subways in major cities are crowded with commuters.",随着新冠感染消退，许多中国民众表示，他们渴望旅行和恢复疫情之前的生活。国内旅游业蓬勃发展，大城市的地铁挤满了通勤者。
"As of mid-March, the positivity rate among P.C.R. tests in China was below 1 percent, down from a peak of 29.2 percent in late December, according to Chinese government data. The figures have become increasingly unreliable, as officials have stopped regular mass testing and made reporting of home testing voluntary.",根据中国政府的数据，截至3月中旬，中国的检测阳性率低于1%，低于去年12月底29.2%的峰值。随着官员们停止定期大规模检测，并使家庭检测报告成为自愿行为，这些数据变得越来越不可靠。
"Developing its own mRNA shot is a source of national pride and a boon for the Communist Party leadership. Creating an mRNA vaccine from scratch is no small feat, experts have said. The first mRNA shots developed for the virus were built on decades of research by scientists around the world.",开发自己的mRNA疫苗是民族自豪感的来源，也对共产党领导人有益。专家们表示，从零开始制造mRNA疫苗是一项不小的成就。针对该病毒开发的第一批mRNA疫苗建立在世界各地科学家数十年研究的基础之上。
"Early in the pandemic, China shipped its vaccines to poorer countries around the world, hoping to use them as a way to build allies and repair damaged diplomatic ties. The campaign, however, lost momentum when officials in several countries raised doubts about the efficacy of Chinese vaccines against more transmissible variants.",疫情早期，中国向世界各地较贫穷的国家运送疫苗，希望以此作为建立盟友和修复受损外交关系的一种方式。然而，随着一些国家的官员质疑中国疫苗对抗更容易传播的变异株是否有效，这场运动失去了动力。
CSPC Pharmaceutical did not say when the vaccine would be available to the public. Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.,石药集团没有说明该疫苗何时向公众开放。该公司的代表没有立即回应置评请求。
"Until last summer, China seemed to be on track to approve BioNTech, a German mRNA vaccine made in partnership with Pfizer. Then it suddenly changed direction, all but abandoning the approval process for BioNTech.",直到去年夏天，中国似乎还有望批准与辉瑞合作生产的德国mRNA疫苗BioNTech。然后，它突然改变了方向，几乎放弃了对BioNTech的审批程序。
"The delay in recognizing a foreign mRNA vaccine appeared to be part of a deeply political exercise as the country has turned more inward under Mr. Xi, who has encouraged Chinese companies to be self-reliant.",延迟承认一种外国mRNA疫苗似乎是一项政治性程度很深的行动，因为在习近平的领导下，中国已经更加向内转，他鼓励中国公司自力更生。
"As the pandemic continued, China also struggled to vaccinate its population, particularly its oldest residents.",随着疫情继续，中国也在努力为民众接种疫苗，特别是年长的居民。
"At a news conference in November just before the country's Covid restrictions eased, Chinese health authorities said that among people who were 80 and older, about 66 percent were fully vaccinated; only 40 percent had a booster.",11月，就在中国放松新冠限制之前的一场新闻发布会上，中国卫生部门表示，在80岁及以上的人群中，约66%的人完全接种了疫苗;只有40%的人接种了强化针。
"As the government pulled back from the ""zero Covid"" policy, more residents appeared to get vaccinated. Nationwide, about 91 percent have had their first two shots, according to the most recent data.","随着政府不再实行""清零""政策，似乎有更多居民接种了疫苗。根据最新的数据，在全国范围内，大约91%的人已经接种了前两针。"
"China's leader, Xi Jinping, flew into Moscow this week cast by Beijing as its emissary for peace in Ukraine. His summit with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, however, demonstrated that his priority remains shoring up ties with Moscow to gird against what he sees as a long campaign by the United States to hobble China's ascent.",中国领导人习近平本周访问莫斯科，北京把他描述为乌克兰战争的和平使者。但他与俄罗斯总统普京的峰会表明，他的首要任务仍是加强与莫斯科的关系，以对抗在他看来美国阻碍中国崛起的长期运动。
"Talk of Ukraine was overshadowed by Mr. Xi's vow of ironclad solidarity with Russia as a political, diplomatic, economic and military partner: two superpowers aligned in countering American dominance and a Western-led world order. The summit showed Mr. Xi's intention to entrench Beijing's tilt toward Moscow against what he recently called an effort by the United States at the full-fledged ""containment"" of China.","习近平对中俄友谊坚不可摧的承诺让关于乌克兰的说法显得无关紧要。习近平承诺继续加强与俄罗斯在政治、外交、经济和军事上的伙伴关系，用两个超级大国的联盟来对抗由美国主导、西方领导的世界秩序。此次峰会显示了习近平进一步牢固北京向莫斯科倾斜的意图，以反对其最近所说的美国全方位""遏制""中国的努力。"
"Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin used the pomp of the three-day state visit that ended on Wednesday to signal to their publics and to Western capitals that the bond between their two countries remained robust and, in their eyes, indispensable, 13 months after Mr. Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. They laid out their vision for the world in a nine-point joint statement that covered everything from Taiwan to climate change and relations with Mongolia, often depicting the United States as the obstacle to a better, fairer world.",习近平对俄罗斯进行的三天国事访问已于周三结束，利用这次访问的盛况，他和普京向各自的国内民众以及西方国家政府发出信号——普京发动了入侵乌克兰战争13个月后中俄之间的纽带仍然牢固，而且在他们看来这种关系不可或缺。在联合声明中，他们向世界阐述了自己的愿景，声明覆盖了从台湾到气候变化，以及中俄与蒙古国关系等九个方面的内容，并且动辄把美国描绘成阻碍世界变得更美好、更公平的障碍。
"""It looks like a strategic plan for a decade or even more. It's not a knee-jerk reaction to the war in Ukraine,"" said Alexander Korolev, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who studies Chinese-Russian relations. Noting the statement's repeated criticisms of the United States, he said: ""The threat is no longer implicit and hypothetical; it's very explicit.""","""联合声明读起来像是一份十年甚至更长期的战略规划，而不是对乌克兰战争的下意识反应，""在澳大利亚新南威尔士大学研究中俄关系的高级讲师亚历山大·科罗廖夫说。他提到声明中多处批评美国，表示:""威胁不再是含蓄和假定的，而是非常明确的。"""
"Discussion of China's murky proposal to end the war in Ukraine appeared only in the last section of their joint statement, offering no specifics about a way forward. In a warning to Western countries supporting Ukraine, it said that any settlement to the crisis must ""prevent the formation of confrontational blocs that add fuel to the flames.""","联合声明仅在最后部分才提到中国对结束乌克兰战争的模糊建议，但没有对如何向前发展提供具体细节。联合声明对支持乌克兰的西方国家发出警告，称任何解决危机的方案都必须""防止形成阵营对抗，拱火浇油""。"
"Instead, the leaders talked up plans to enhance economic cooperation and draw more Chinese investors to Russia. They declared their admiration for each other's authoritarian rule, with Mr. Xi going as far as endorsing Mr. Putin for another term in power, indicating to Russians that he was sure that they should back Mr. Putin in elections a year away.",两名领导人谈得更多的反而是加强经济合作、将更多中国投资者吸引到俄罗斯的计划。他们对彼此的威权主义统治表示赞赏，习近平甚至支持普京继续掌权，这是在向俄罗斯人表明，他对他们在一年后的选举中应该投普京的票确信无疑。
"""Xi Jinping in effect launched the re-election campaign for Putin,"" said Maria Repnikova, a scholar at Georgia State University who studies political communication in China and Russia. ""It seems like an important signal that highlights the extent of their friendship and that he's really rooting for Putin.""","""习近平实际上为普京开始了连任竞选，""在美国佐治亚州立大学研究中国和俄罗斯政治交往的学者玛丽亚·列普尼科娃表示。""这似乎是个重要信号，凸显了他们友谊的程度，以及习近平对普京的真实支持。"""
"But while Mr. Xi sought to show China's commitment to Russia, he stopped short of writing Mr. Putin a blank check of support. Though Mr. Putin claimed that a new pipeline for delivering natural gas to China would be finished by 2030, Mr. Xi did not confirm the deal.",不过，虽然习近平试图展示中国对俄罗斯的承诺，但他对普京的支持不是无限度的。尽管普京声称一条向中国输送天然气的新管道将于2030年建成，但习近平并未证实这笔交易。
"China also calibrated the language used to describe its relationship with Russia. When Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin issued a joint statement last year, three weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, they had said that Beijing and Moscow had a ""limitless friendship."" This time, they sought to draw clearer boundaries, declaring that they are not in a traditional political and military alliance. Mr. Xi and other Chinese officials have also generally avoided reviving that rhetoric of ""limitless friendship,"" even though Mr. Putin still used it.","中国还调整了用来描述与俄罗斯关系的措辞。去年，习近平和普京发表联合声明时曾说中俄友谊""无止境""，那是在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的三周前。这次，他们试图给友谊限定范围，称两国关系不是传统的军事政治联盟。习近平和其他中国官员也都已避免重提""无止境""的友谊，尽管普京仍在使用这个说法。"
"Still, the symbolic support that Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin offered each other will have its own value for each leader, said Ms. Repnikova, the scholar at Georgia State University. She noted that the main state-owned broadcasters of the two countries also signed an agreement to share historical content, underscoring their shared interest in inoculating their populations against Western political influences.",尽管如此，习近平和普京向对方提供的象征性支持对两位领导人来说各有价值，佐治亚州立大学的列普尼科娃说道。她指出，两国的主要国有广播公司还签署了一项共享历史内容的协议，突显了他们让本国人民免受西方政治影响的共同利益。
"""It's signaling that, however limited, it's still a very important partnership that China is not alone vis-a-vis the West, and Russia is definitely supported by China,"" she said.","""这是在发信号表明，无论是否有止境，两国间仍有非常重要的伙伴关系，中国在西方面前并不孤单，俄罗斯的确得到了中国的支持，""她说。"
"Mr. Xi's and Mr. Putin's media operatives have cast their relationship as a brotherly bond, cemented over shots of vodka, birthday cakes and ice cream during more than 40 meetings. But Mr. Xi's calculus toward Russia is not based on sentiment. It is founded in China's broader strategic calculations that are likely to remain fixed, whatever the outcome of the coming spring battles in Ukraine.",习近平和普京的宣传人员将他们的关系描述为兄弟般的情谊，双方已见过40多次面，一起喝伏特加、吃生日蛋糕和冰淇淋，关系变得更亲密。但习近平向俄罗斯靠近的考虑不只建立在感情基础上，还关乎中国更广泛的战略考量，无论俄罗斯即将在乌克兰展开的春季战役结果如何，这种考量可能都不会改变。
"In Mr. Xi's view, recently stated in unusually blunt terms, the United States is engaged in ""all-around containment, encirclement and suppression of China"" a campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure that he says has brought ""unprecedented severe challenges"" to the country. To counter Western pressure, Mr. Xi wants to give Mr. Putin the political and economic support to secure their partnership, even if China may not want to wade into Russia's war in Ukraine.","在习近平眼中，美国已在对中国进行(用他最近异常直白的说法)""全方位的遏制、围堵、打压""，他说，美国的制裁和外交压力运动给中国带来了""前所未有的严峻挑战""。为了对抗西方的压力，习近平想通过向普京提供政治和经济支持来确保他们的伙伴关系，虽然中国可能并不想介入俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争。"
"""Xi is making a significant gesture of political support to Putin with this trip, basically demonstrating that the relationship will be resilient even in these straitened circumstances and that he is willing to live with the opprobrium of the West,"" said Andrew Small, the author of author of ""No Limits: The Inside Story of China's War With the West.""","""习近平通过这次访问向普京做出了政治支持的重要姿态，这基本上表明，即使在这种困难情况下，他们的关系仍然坚韧，而且他愿意承受西方的谴责，""《无止境:中国与西方斗争的内幕》一书的作者马安洲(Andrew Small)说。"
"Beijing had indicated that Mr. Xi would help promote talks between Russia and Ukraine as part of his visit, after Western powers urged China to use its influence over Russia to stop the war. But in the end, Mr. Small said, ""There was even less of a simulation of a 'peace mission' than Chinese diplomats had pre-briefed.""","尽管在西方大国敦促中国利用自己对俄罗斯的影响力来停止战争后，中国政府曾表示习近平此次国事访问的目的之一是帮助推动俄乌对话，但马安洲说，最终""'和平之旅'的成色比中国外交官预先介绍的还要低""。"
"The visit by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan to Kyiv this week in support of Ukraine, coinciding with Mr. Xi's talks with Mr. Putin, appears likely to deepen Chinese views that the war has coalesced into a global contest also aimed at Beijing.",日本首相岸田文雄本周访问基辅以示对乌克兰的支持。这次恰好与习普会同时进行的访问看来可能会强化中国对俄乌战争的看法，即这场战争已经整合为一场同样针对北京的全球较量。
"Strong relations with Russia have become more crucial to China as its ties with the United States have deteriorated. A succession of events since last year appear to have hardened Mr. Xi's wariness of Washington, even as he as sought to stabilize relations with President Biden.",随着与美国的关系恶化，与俄罗斯的牢固关系对中国来说已变得更加重要。就在习近平试图稳定与拜登总统关系的时候，去年以来发生的一系列事件似乎加强了他对华盛顿的戒心。
"Chinese officials have pointed to U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductors that are needed in anything from supercomputing to weapons development. They have also condemned moves by the United States and Britain to help Australia build nuclear-powered submarines, to counter China's military growth.",中国官员提出了美国限制中国获得先进半导体的问题，这种半导体对超级计算和武器研发等领域必不可少。中国还谴责美国和英国为对抗中国军事力量的增长，帮助澳大利亚建造核动力潜艇的做法。
"After Mr. Xi's state visit ended, China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, issued a statement about its significance, saying: ""The principal contradiction in the world today is not the so-called 'confrontation between democracy and authoritarianism' that a handful of countries have played up, but rather the struggle between development and the containment of development.""","习近平的俄罗斯访问结束后，中国外交部长秦刚发表了一份关于其意义的声明，称""当今世界的主要矛盾根本不是个别国家渲染的所谓'民主对抗威权'，而是发展与遏制发展、公理与强权之间的斗争""。"
"""Beijing is trying to emphasize to a mainly domestic audience that the United States is engaged in a multidomain, multipronged, and multi-actor effort to actively inhibit China's continued rise,"" said Jude Blanchette, the holder of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.","""北京正试图向国内受众为主的人强调，美国正在进行多领域、多管齐下、多方面的努力，以有效地抑制中国的不断崛起，""华盛顿的战略与国际研究中心费和中国研究项目主任白明(Jude Blanchette)表示。"
"Mr. Xi's term of ""all-around containment"" is intended to summarize ""an effort to slow Chinese growth, block its access to cutting-edge technologies, and to erode China's ties with neighboring countries,"" Mr. Blanchette said.","习近平用""全方位的遏制""一词来概括""放慢中国经济增长速度、阻止中国获得尖端技术、削弱中国与邻国关系的努力""，白明表示。"
"According to this worldview, Ukraine, rather than being the victim of an unprovoked war by Russia, was caught up in a proxy battle by the United States and its allies against Moscow and by extension, Beijing aimed at reasserting American global dominance. That theme is echoed in many recent assessments of the conflict by Chinese state institutes and People's Liberation Army analysts.",按照这种世界观，乌克兰不是俄罗斯无端侵略的受害者，而是卷入了美国及其盟友以重申美国全球主导地位为目的、针对莫斯科——进而针对北京——进行的代理人战争。这个主题在中国政府部门和解放军分析人士最近发表的回顾这场冲突的文章中多次得到了呼应。
"""The eruption of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was the inevitable outcome of the United States government's long-term strategy,"" Yang Guanghai, a professor at China's National University of Defense Technology, wrote in a recent study of the war. ""The U.S. position of exploiting Ukraine as a proxy will not change. Like Russia, China is also a primary target of the U.S. strategy of 'great power competition.'""","""此次俄乌冲突的爆发就是美国政府长期以来推行这一战略的必然结果，""中国国防科技大学教授杨光海最近在一篇分析这场战争的文章中写道。""未来无论冲突如何演化，美国利用乌克兰作为代理人同俄对抗的立场都不会改变，""文章写道，还说""同俄罗斯一样，中国也是美国'大国竞争'战略的重点矛头所向。"""
"Any willingness by Mr. Xi to try mediating between Kyiv and Moscow, then, is likely to remain tightly constrained by his wider commitment to sticking close to Russia and Mr. Putin.",因此，习近平试图在基辅和莫斯科之间进行斡旋的任何意愿都可能囿于跟俄罗斯和普京保持密切关系的更广泛承诺。
"In the wake of his meeting with Mr. Putin, Mr. Xi may reach out to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. That would be Mr. Xi's first call with the leader since the invasion began. Even if does so, the peace proposal that China has outlined is unlikely to gain favor in Kyiv because it implicitly echoes official Russian grievances with NATO that could limit Ukraine's claims.",习近平与普京见面后可能会与乌克兰总统泽连斯基进行接触。那将是自俄罗斯入侵开始以来习近平与乌克兰领导人的首次通话。即使他这样做，中国提出和平解决方案也不太可能得到基辅的支持，因为其中含蓄地呼应了俄罗斯官方对北约的不满，这可能会让乌克兰的主张受到限制。
"In their joint statement, Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin criticized NATO's efforts to pay more attention to Asia. The leaders held up China and Russia's relationship as superior to traditional Western military blocs because it is ""mature, stable, independent and resilient."" China's official news agency, Xinhua, issued an article explaining why the two countries would not want to establish a formal alliance that obliged them to aid each other in wars.","习近平和普京在联合声明中批评了北约越来越关注亚洲的努力。两名领导人称中俄关系超越了传统的西方军事集团，因为""中俄关系成熟、稳定、自主、坚韧""。中国官方通讯社新华社发表了一篇文章，解释为什么中俄不愿意建立一个正式联盟使双方有义务在战争中互相帮助。"
"Some readers were not convinced. ""It's only in name that we're not allies,"" said one reader's comment.","文章未能说服部分读者。""口头不结盟而已，""一名读者评论道。"
"China's top leader, Xi Jinping, has cast himself as a global statesman, helping Saudi Arabia and Iran broker a deal to restore diplomatic ties while extolling the virtues of ""Chinese solutions and wisdom"" in solving the world's biggest security challenges.","通过帮助沙特阿拉伯与伊朗达成协议恢复外交关系，中国最高领导人习近平将自己塑造成一名全球政治家。他提出的全球安全倡议已在国内被誉为解决世界上最大安全挑战的""中国方案和中国智慧""。"
"Now, Mr. Xi is putting himself at the center of Russia's war with Ukraine, working to portray himself as a mediator who could cool down the protracted fight.",现在，习近平置身于俄乌战争的中心，努力把自己描绘成一名可以给这场持久战争降温的斡旋者。
"The Chinese leader is expected to meet in person next week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine could follow. China has already proposed a peace settlement, though it does not address important details such as whether Russian troops would withdraw. In announcing Mr. Xi's visit to Russia, a Chinese official on Friday said it was ""for the sake of peace.""","这位中国领导人将与俄罗斯总统普京见面，之后还可能与乌克兰总统泽连斯基通电话。中国已经提出了这场战争的政治解决方案，尽管一字未提俄罗斯军队是否需要撤出乌克兰这种重要细节。中国官员上周五宣布习近平访问俄罗斯时，将其称为一次""和平之旅""。"
"At stake for Beijing is its push for legitimacy as leader of an alternative world order to the one dominated by the United States, a role it has sought with growing urgency to resist what Mr. Xi described as Washington's ""containment, encirclement and suppression of China.""","北京一直努力争取成为一个不再由美国占主导地位的世界秩序的领导者，此行关系到这一地位的正当性。中国越来越迫切地寻求这一角色，以回击习近平所说的美国对中国""全方位的遏制、围堵、打压""。"
"Skepticism abounds in the West about Mr. Xi's intentions on the war, given his conflicting goals and interests. Beijing has never condemned Russia's invasion and parrots the Kremlin's assertion that the war was provoked by the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",考虑到习近平的目标和利益相互矛盾，西方对他在这场战争中的意图充满怀疑。中国从未对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰做出过谴责，并且重复克里姆林宫关于战争是由北大西洋公约组织东扩挑起的说法。
"Now, Mr. Xi's visit will occur as even more signs of global polarization over Russia take shape. On Friday, The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Putin on accusations of war crimes in the Ukraine conflict. And NATO allies of Ukraine have promised even more resources to Ukraine to help repel Russian forces, including Poland's and Slovakia's intention to send fighter jets to Kyiv.",眼下在习近平访俄之际，有更多迹象表明全球对俄罗斯的看法存在两极分化。上周五，国际刑事法院对普京发出了逮捕令，指控他在乌克兰冲突中犯有战争罪。乌克兰的北约盟友已承诺提供更多资源，帮助该国击退俄罗斯侵略军，波兰和斯洛伐克等国都有意向基辅提供战斗机。
"Both Russia and Ukraine look at China as a potentially transformative power, one with enough clout to break the impasse. But both Moscow and Kyiv are also keenly aware that China could fundamentally alter the dynamics on the battlefield if it plays a more direct role in replenishing Moscow's badly depleted arsenal.",俄罗斯和乌克兰都将中国视为有可能起到改变作用的国家，中国有足够的影响力打破僵局。但莫斯科和基辅也非常清楚，如果中国发挥更直接的作用，补充俄罗斯严重耗尽的武器库的话，可能从根本上改变战争的局面。
"""China's international influence as a great power is required for peace now more than almost ever,"" said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, reflecting Beijing's own sense of its growing global importance following the deal between Tehran and Riyadh.","""就实现和平来说，现在比以往任何时候都更加需要中国作为一个大国的国际影响力，""中国人民大学国际关系教授时殷弘表示。这个说法反映了在伊沙恢复外交关系后，中国意识到自己在全球的重要性日益增长。"
"Building off that momentum and stepping into the fray of the war could help Mr. Xi achieve one of his most pressing needs: repairing Beijing's relationship with Europe. With the Chinese economy struggling, he wants to prevent the region from aligning too closely with the United States on trade and investment restrictions targeting China.",在这个声势驱动下，涉足俄乌战争纷争可能会帮助习近平实现他最紧迫的目标之一:修复中欧关系。在中国经济面临重重困难之际，该地区在针对中国的贸易和投资限制上的做法与美国过于接近，他想阻止这一点。
"To do that, analysts say Mr. Xi will likely need to demonstrate a strong enough effort to end Russia's war, in a move to exploit splits within the European Union over the American push to counter China. If he can, it could help satisfy powers eager to ramp up economic engagement with Beijing, including Germany and France.",分析人士说，要做到这点，习近平可能需要在结束俄乌战争上表现出进行了足够大的努力，以便利用欧盟内部在美国推动的抗衡中国方面所存在的分歧。做到这点将有助于满足急于加强与中国经济交往的大国，包括德国和法国。
"""Xi Jinping's target is not Russia or Ukraine, but rather Western Europe,"" said Danny Russel, a vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. assistant secretary of state. ""Ultimately, what he's trying to do is set it up so that in the eyes of the Germans and the French, he gave it a shot.""","""习近平的目标不是俄罗斯或乌克兰，而是西欧，""亚洲协会政策研究所副所长、美国前助理国务卿丹尼·拉塞尔说。""他最终试图要做的，是摆出一个在德国人和法国人眼里他尽了最大努力的样子。"""
"For Moscow, the bar for peace talks is high. Russia has rejected Western demands to withdraw troops as a condition for talks. Mr. Putin, in meeting with Mr. Xi, will likely prioritize asking for help replenishing stocks of military-grade components and increasing exports to China to fatten the Kremlin's war chest. It will also give Russia a chance to emphasize that it has not been isolated by the global community.",对莫斯科来说，和平谈判的门槛很高。俄罗斯已拒绝了西方提出的把撤军作为谈判条件的要求。在与习近平会晤时，普京可能把寻求帮助作为优先事项提出来，让中国帮助补充军用级别的零部件库存，并增加从俄罗斯的进口，从而充实克里姆林宫的战争资金。这也将让俄罗斯有机会强调自己并没有遭到国际社会的孤立。
"For Ukraine, China has long represented a potential lifeline, holding enough sway over Russia to influence the war. Mr. Zelensky, with Washington's encouragement, has sought to hold talks with Mr. Xi for months. He even dispatched his wife, Olena Zelenska, to deliver to the Chinese delegation a letter requesting a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",对乌克兰来说，中国长期以来一直是一条潜在的生命线，因为中国对俄罗斯的影响力足以对俄乌战争产生影响。几个月来，泽连斯基在华盛顿的鼓励下一直寻找机会与习近平通话。他甚至让夫人叶莲娜·泽连斯卡娅在瑞士达沃斯举行的世界经济论坛上向中国代表团递交了一封信，希望能与习会谈。
"China's role is complicated. Beijing has sought to portray itself as a neutral bystander in the war but has continued to provide diplomatic and economic support to Russia, and has welcomed visits from Mr. Putin's allies.",中国在其中的角色很复杂。虽然北京方面寻求将自己描绘为这场战争的中立旁观者，但它一直在向俄罗斯提供外交和经济支持，还欢迎普京的盟友来访。
The position paper China released in February that outlined a political settlement to the war was widely criticized by Western leaders for lacking concrete plans and avoiding demands that could hurt Beijing's ties with Moscow.,中国今年2月发表了关于政治解决乌克兰战争的立场文件，但由于缺乏具体措施，并避免提出可能损害北京与莫斯科关系的要求，该文件受到了西方领导人的广泛批评。
"And Washington warned last month that China was preparing to provide lethal weapons to Russia and threatened to impose sanctions if it follows through. Beijing denied the allegation and has accused the United States of driving the two countries toward ""conflict and confrontation.""","上个月，华盛顿曾警告称中国正在准备向俄罗斯提供致命性武器，并威胁称如果中国执意那样做，将对其实施制裁。北京否认了美国的指控，并指责美国让两国关系""陷入冲突对抗""。"
"Analysts say it is unlikely China would take the risk of supplying Moscow with weapons and ammunition unless Russian forces were facing collapse. Beijing is prepared to back Mr. Putin, but only enough to help him remain in power and preserve a united front against the West.",分析人士说，除非俄罗斯军队面临崩溃，中国不太可能会冒险向莫斯科提供武器弹药。中国政府虽然有支持普京的准备，但也只会提供仅仅足以帮助他继续掌权，维持中俄反对西方统一战线的支持。
"""Beijing is agnostic about the conflict,"" said Aleksandr Gabuev, an expert on Russia's relations with Asia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research group. ""What it wants is to prevent a catastrophic Russian defeat, which could threaten Putin.""","""北京对这场冲突持不可知态度，""研究机构卡内基国际和平基金会的俄罗斯与亚洲关系专家亚历山大·加布耶夫说。""它想要的是防止俄罗斯出现灾难性的失败，那可能会威胁到普京的统治。"""
"The deep ties between the two nuclear-armed powers are said to be enhanced by a personal affinity between Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin, who both declared a ""no-limits"" partnership shortly before Ukraine was invaded. Since then, Russia has grown increasingly reliant on China.","据说，这两个拥核大国之间的深厚关系因习近平与普京私人交好得到加强，两人在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰前夕曾宣布中俄友谊""无止境""。那之后，俄罗斯越来越依赖中国。"
"""There are no ties that are more important to Russia,"" Mr. Gabuev said.","""俄罗斯没有比俄中关系更重要的关系了，""加布耶夫说。"
"In announcing the three-day visit by Mr. Xi starting March 20, Russia said that the sides would discuss ""issues of further development of the comprehensive partnership"" between the two countries, as well as ""deepening Russian-Chinese cooperation on the international arena."" In Kremlin practice, a state visit signifies the highest form of bilateral talks, usually reserved for the closest allies.","俄罗斯宣布习近平于3月20日起对该国进行为期三天的国事访问时表示，双方将讨论两国""进一步发展全面伙伴关系的问题""，以及""俄中在国际舞台上深化合作""的问题。对克里姆林宫来说，国事访问是级别最高的双边会谈，是通常只留给最亲密盟友的待遇。"
"Discussing the visit on Friday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said that ""maintaining world peace and promoting common development are the purposes of China's foreign policy,"" adding that on the Ukraine issue, China has always stood on the side of peace, dialogue and historical correctness.""","中国外交部发言人汪文斌上周五在提到这次访问时说，""维护世界和平、促进共同发展是中国外交政策的宗旨""，并补充说，在乌克兰问题上，中国始终""站在和平一边，站在对话一边，站在历史正确一边""。"
"Neither China nor Ukraine has announced a call between their two leaders, the protocol around which will be more complicated to navigate with Russia.",中国和乌克兰都还没有宣布两国领导人将举行通话。俄罗斯让相关外交程序变得更加复杂。
"It remains to be seen whether Mr. Xi will raise the idea of peace negotiations during his visit, and seize on the momentum from the deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran.",习近平是否会在访俄期间提出用和平谈判解决冲突、把握沙伊和解的势头还有待观察。
"That agreement was struck under vastly different conditions. Both sides had already held extensive talks and expressed a willingness to mend ties. Ukraine and Russia, on the other hand, remain locked in a bloody war in which neither side appears ready to negotiate an end.",伊朗与沙特是在截然不同的情况下达成协议的。两国已为复交进行了广泛的谈判，表达了想修复关系的意愿。乌克兰和俄罗斯则不同，两国仍陷在一场血腥的战争中，双方似乎都没有做好通过谈判结束战争的准备。
"""While the Chinese role in the Iran-Saudi agreement is eye-catching and shows that China is playing a bigger role on the international stage, its lessons do not apply well to the Russia-Ukraine situation,"" said Dennis Wilder, former head of China analysis at the C.I.A.","""虽然中国在伊沙恢复外交关系上的作用引人注目，表明中国正在国际舞台上发挥更大的作用，但从这件事上学到的东西不适用于俄乌局势，""曾在美国中央情报局任中国分析负责人的丹尼斯·怀尔德说。"
"China contends that the Saudi-Iran accord reflects its vision of a new style of global governance that emphasizes dialogue and communication over military deterrence and intervention. Beijing was able to serve as a credible mediator because it cultivated close ties with both Tehran and Riyadh and never exploited their differences, Chinese analysts say.",中国认为，沙特与伊朗同意复交反映了中国在新型全球治理上强调对话和沟通而非军事威慑和干预的愿景。中国分析家说，中国能够充当可靠的斡旋者，是因为北京与德黑兰和利雅得都有密切关系，它从未利用过伊朗与沙特的分歧。
"Any Chinese-led negotiations over Ukraine could hinge on how Kyiv views Beijing. Before the war, China and Ukraine had a blossoming relationship supported by growing trade in commodities and arms sales.",任何由中国牵头的谈判都可能取决于基辅对北京的看法。在战争爆发前，在大宗商品和武器销售的增长支持下，中乌关系曾经蓬勃发展。
"Though Ukraine has been careful about criticizing China's tacit support for Russia's invasion, Beijing's inaction on the crisis for more than a year and its amplification of Kremlin propaganda about NATO aggression has undercut its credibility.",尽管乌克兰在批评中国暗中支持俄罗斯入侵上一直持谨慎态度，但北京一年多来在这场危机上无所作为、还为克里姆林宫宣传的北约扩张论当放大器的做法已削弱了中国政府的可信度。
"In some ways, the war has served Chinese interests. The conflict has provided Beijing with access to discounted oil from a heavily sanctioned Russia. It has also created a greater opportunity for Mr. Xi to drive a wedge between the United States and a war-weary Europe reluctant to experience another winter with high energy prices.",从某些方面来看，这场战争对中国有利。由于西方对俄罗斯的制裁，这场冲突已为中国提供了廉价获得俄罗斯石油的渠道，也为习近平创造了离间美国与其欧洲盟友的更大机会，欧洲国家已厌倦了战争，不愿再经历一个高能源价格的冬季。
"Most importantly, the war has prevented the United States from dedicating more attention and resources to Asia, where China presents a far greater long-term challenge to the Western-led world order than Russia.",最重要的是，这场战争已阻止了美国把更多的注意力和资源投入到亚洲，而中国在该地区对西方主导的世界秩序构成的长期挑战要远大于俄罗斯。
"""If I was sitting in Beijing, I would think this is a good thing,"" said Theresa Fallon, the director of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels. ""The U.S. can run down its ammunition and artillery shells, and their attention is spread across the board instead of being laser-like focused on their pacing challenge, which is China.""","""如果我是中国政府的话，我会认为这是件好事，""布鲁塞尔的俄欧亚研究中心主任特蕾莎·法伦说。""美国会耗尽弹药和炮弹，他们的注意力会被分散，而不是像激光那样聚焦在步步逼近的挑战——中国身上。"""
"Mr. Xi is on a mission of ""national rejuvenation,"" underscoring what he perceives as the United States standing in his way. Mr. Putin's complaints about NATO's encroachment ring true to Mr. Xi, as the United States strengthens security ties in the region with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia.","习近平实现""中华民族伟大复兴""的使命凸显出他把美国视作拦路石的想法。随着美国加强与日本、韩国、菲律宾和澳大利亚在亚太地区的安全关系，普京抱怨的北约东扩对习近平来说是真实的现实。"
And part of Beijing's strategy to counter that pressure is to stake out a greater role in global stability to challenge U.S. influence.,中国应对这种压力的战略之一是在全球稳定中发挥更大的作用，以挑战美国的影响力。
"""Compared to China's previous diplomatic actions, it is a very proactive step forward,"" said Wu Xinbo, dean of international studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ""China will play an increasingly active role on the international stage, especially in solving regional conflicts.""","""与中国以前的外交做法相比，这是迈出了非常积极的一步，""复旦大学国际问题研究院院长吴心伯说。""中国将在国际舞台上发挥越来越积极的作用，尤其是在解决区域冲突方面。"""
"To a man with a hammer, a renowned psychologist once posited, everything looks like a nail.",一位著名的心理学家说过这样的话:一个拿着锤子的人看什么都像钉子。
"For most of his decade in power, Xi Jinping, China's leader, has usually arrived at the same conclusion for how best to deal with the country's issues: get the Communist Party more involved. And now, as China is confronting an economy lacking the dynamism of the past and teetering from a real estate sector in crisis and local governments overrun with debt, Mr. Xi is again wielding his hammer.",在中国领导人习近平掌权头十年的大部分时间里，对于国内问题的最佳处理之道，他通常得出的是一致的结论:让中共更多地介入。现在，随着中国经济正在失去曾经的活力，房地产行业陷入危机，地方政府负债累累，习近平再次挥起了锤子。
"At the annual gathering of China's national legislature, which concluded on Monday, Mr. Xi introduced a series of sweeping changes to the country's regulatory framework, allowing the party's top leaders to assert more direct control over financial policy and bank regulation. Appointments for allies of Mr. Xi to key regulatory roles and additional shake-ups are expected in the coming days, further cementing the party's oversight of the financial system.",在周一闭幕的全国人民代表大会年度会议上，习近平对中国的监管框架推出了一系列大刀阔斧的改革措施，让中共高层对金融政策和银行监管拥有更直接的控制。预计在未来几天，习近平的亲信们将被赋予关键的监管职务，对监管框架进行更多改组，进一步巩固中共对金融体系的把控。
"""It's very consistent with what Xi Jinping has been rolling out over the past 10 years,"" said Max Zenglein, chief economist at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. ""Whenever he's confronted with a problem, the solution is greater centralization to the party.""","""这与习近平在过去十年里推出的政策非常一致，""柏林墨卡托中国研究所首席经济学家曾林(Max Zenglein)说。""每当遇到问题，他的解决办法都是将权力更多地集中到中共手里。"""
"The moves were the latest evidence of how Mr. Xi continues to reshape China's business climate, steering the world's second-largest economy away from the free-market policies that underpinned its ascent. While past Chinese leaders sought to maintain a buffer between the party and the private sector, Mr. Xi has erased those lines and made clear that businesses are there to advance the party's agenda.",这些改革是习近平将如何继续重塑中国营商环境的最新例证，他正在引导这个世界第二大经济体偏离曾支撑其崛起的市场经济。过去的中国领导人曾寻求在中共和民营部门之间保持一个缓冲区，但习近平已经消除了这些界限，明确表示企业的存在是为了推进中共的议程。
"Mr. Xi underscored that message on March 6 when he declared that the party had always regarded the private sector as ""our own people"" and that while it had a responsibility to support businesses in difficult times, it also needed to ""offer guidance"" in times of confusion.","习近平在3月6日强调了这点，他宣称中共始终将民营企业家视为""自己人""，虽然中共有责任在""民营企业遇到困难的时候给予支持""，但也需要在""民营企业遇到困惑的时候给予指导""。"
"With the economy growing near its slowest pace in decades, it is essential to Mr. Xi that the financial sector comply with his vision. He needs bankers to allocate capital in the ways that China wants its money spent and prevent domestic funds from moving overseas, while exercising caution to avoid overextending loans and jeopardizing the financial system.",随着中国经济的增长速度接近几十年来的最低水平，对习近平来说，让金融行业符合他的愿景极其重要。他需要银行家们按照政府希望的方式分配资金，防止国内资金流向海外，同时谨慎行事，避免过度发放贷款，危及金融体系。
"In what appeared to be a precursor to the structural changes in the financial regulatory bureaucracy, China's top anti-graft watchdog also published a not-so-veiled warning to bankers last month. It said it would ""seriously investigate and deal with the people who neglect the party's leadership in financial work and state-owned enterprises.""","上个月，中国最高反腐败监管机构中纪委还曾向银行家发出了一个几乎不加掩饰的警告，称将""严肃查处罔顾党对金融工作、国有企业的领导""。这似乎是要对金融监管机构进行结构性改革的先兆。"
"Echoing the message of ""common prosperity,"" one of Mr. Xi's hallmark slogans to narrow the wealth gap in Chinese society, the watchdog said bankers should embrace the party's values and avoid the ideologies of the ""financial elite."" The group said bankers should not emulate the West with its singular focus on money.","""共同富裕""是习近平为缩小中国社会贫富差距提出的标志性口号之一，与这个信息相呼应，中纪委表示，银行家应该拥护党的价值观，拒绝""金融精英论""，还说，银行家不应该效仿西方只重视金钱的做法。"
"Heads are already starting to roll. Bao Fan, a prominent investment banker and chief executive of China Renaissance Holdings, vanished last month. After initially saying that it was unable to contact Mr. Bao, China Renaissance said it had learned that the banker was cooperating with an investigation being carried out by certain Chinese authorities.",有些人已开始受到惩罚。知名投资银行家、华兴资本首席执行官包凡在上个月失踪。华兴资本最初曾表示无法与包凡取得联系，之后说，已获悉包凡正在配合中国有关当局的调查。
"Last month, China's top prosecutor charged Tian Huiyu, the former president of China Merchants Bank, one of the country's biggest commercial lenders, with abuse of power and insider trading. When he was expelled from the Communist Party in October, the party said in a statement that Mr. Tian had led ""a corrupted life with loose morals"" for accepting lavish gifts as well as invitations for banquets, travel and golf.","上个月，中国最高检察机构指控国内最大的商业银行之一招商银行前行长田惠宇滥用职权、涉嫌内幕交易。他已在去年 10月被开除党籍，当时，中共曾发通报说，田惠宇""生活腐化、道德败坏""，收受奢侈礼物，""接受宴请、旅游、打高尔夫球等活动安排""。"
"The pointed rhetoric, targeted oversight and crackdowns on high-profile figures are reminiscent of China's so-called rectification campaign of the last few years in the technology sector. This resulted in huge fines, the upending of business strategies and tycoons driven underground.",尖锐的措辞、有针对性的监管，以及对高姿态人士的打压都让人回忆想中国过去几年对科技行业的所谓整改，那场运动导致了巨额罚单、商业计划破灭、大亨们销声匿迹。
"But unlike the technology industry, which had been flying high and amassing greater influence in society, the financial sector is under tremendous pressure partially because of the shaky balance sheets of local governments and the banks that lend to them. ANZ Research estimates that Chinese local government debts have grown 16 percent annually over the last five years.",但与飞速发展、对社会拥有更大影响力的科技行业不同，金融行业已经承受着巨大压力，部分原因是地方政府入不敷出，借款给地方政府的银行面临财务危机。据澳新银行研究中心估计，在过去五年里，中国地方政府的债务平均每年增长16%。
"After three years of footing the bill for China's strict ""zero Covid"" policy of constant testing, local government finances are depleted, a situation worsened by a property market collapse that has diminished a once-reliable revenue stream from leasing state-owned land to real estate developers.","为中国严格的新冠""清零""政策(包括常态化大规模核酸检测)埋了三年单后，地方政府的财政已经耗尽，房地产市场的崩溃让情况变得更糟，因为地方政府以前能通过卖地获得一笔可靠的收入。"
"On Friday, China's legislature, known as the National People's Congress, approved a proposal to create a new regulatory body called the State Bureau of Financial Supervision and Administration to oversee China's 400 trillion yuan, or $57 billion, financial system. The new entity was formed out of China's existing banking and insurance regulatory commission, and it will absorb some roles played by other agencies including the central bank and the securities regulator.",上周五，中国立法机构全国人大批准了组建国家金融监督管理总局的议案，这个新机构将负责监管中国400万亿人民币的金融体系。新机构在中国现有的银行保险监督管理委员会基础上组建，并将把中央银行和证券监督管理委员会现有的一些监管职责吸收进来。
"Darrell Duffie, a professor of management and finance at Stanford University and a close watcher of China, said the changes are consistent with how China turns to additional regulation to redress past mistakes. In this case, he said, it wanted to correct the ""excess financial exuberance"" that has caused dozens of real estate developers to default on loans and left the sector awash in debt.","斯坦福大学管理与金融学教授达雷尔·达菲一直在密切观察中国事务，他说，这些改革与中国使用更多的监管来纠正过去错误的方式一致。他说，中国这次想纠正的是""过度金融繁荣""，那已经导致了房地产行业负债累累，几十家房地产开发商拖欠贷款。"
"It is a delicate dance, Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ Research, wrote in a report, because the authorities need to make sure that banks and companies don't binge on risky loans, while not suffocating the economy, because credit ""remains the most important driver of growth.""","澳新银行研究中心的高级中国策略师邢兆鹏在一份报告中写道，这样做需要技巧，因为当局需要在确保银行和企业不过度依赖高风险贷款的同时不扼杀经济，因为信贷""仍是最重要的增长动力""。"
"Analysts say this latest campaign to clean up the financial sector is also rooted in growing concern about the adequacy of the country's financial regulation, which had been called into question in recent years by a series of missteps and scandals that tested the party's ability to maintain order.",分析人士说，最近搞这场清理金融部门的运动的原因之一是，人们越来越担心中国的金融监管是否充分。近年来，金融监管上的一系列失误和丑闻已让中共维持金融秩序的能力受到质疑。
"Peer-to-peer lending initially took off in China around 2014 without much oversight until a series of defaults and scandals unleashed a wave of protests that forced the government to shut down the sector several years later. Last year, demonstrations erupted when depositors in rural banks in Henan Province in central China said the institutions froze their savings accounts and refused to let them withdraw their money.",中国的P2P借贷最初是在2014年前后兴起的，一直没受太多监管，直到发生了一系列违约和丑闻，引发了一波抗议浪潮，政府才被迫在几年后关闭了该行业。去年，中国河南省多家村镇银行的储户们采取了抗议行动，他们表示，银行冻结了他们的存款，不让他们取钱。
"Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, a Japanese brokerage, said some of these changes were long overdue because ""many problems"" emerged in recent years reflecting the challenge of local governments supervising the financial institutions that they rely on.","日本券商野村证券首席中国经济学家陆挺表示，新改革措施中的一些举措早就该采取了，因为近年来出现的""许多问题""反映出，让地方政府监管它们所依赖的金融机构是一种挑战。"
"In addition to the new government financial regulator, the Communist Party is expected to resurrect a policy-setting committee that will report directly to top leadership. The Central Financial Works Commission was formed in 1998 after the Asian financial crisis so that party leaders could play a role in regulation. It was disbanded five years later when China established a banking regulator.",除了成立新的国家金融监督管理总局外，预计中共还将恢复一个直接向最高领导层报告的政策制定委员会。中共中央金融工作委员会是1998年在亚洲金融危机后成立的，为的是让中共领导人能在监管上起作用。五年后中国设立了银行业监管机构，该委员会解散。
"In the reincarnation, the commission is expected to work closely with the new regulator, and it will be headed by a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the inner circle of power in Chinese politics comprising mostly Xi loyalists and the party's top leaders who oversee the day-to-day running of the country. Bloomberg earlier reported the revival of the committee.",这个重新设立的委员会预计将与新的监管机构密切合作，将由一名政治局常委领导，主要由习近平亲信和中共最高领导人组成的政治局常务委员会是中国政治权力的核心，常委们负责管理国家的日常运作。彭博新闻社早些时候报道了中共中央金融工作委员会的恢复。
"The revamp confirms what many in China already know. Whether it is politics, the military or the economy, all roads lead to Mr. Xi. On Friday, the 2,952 delegates of the national legislature endorsed Mr. Xi for a rare third term as president. There was not a single dissenting vote.",金融监管机构改革证实了中国许多人已经知道的事实。无论是政治、军事还是经济，所有的权力都掌握在习近平手中。上周五，2952名全国人大代表投票通过了习近平打破惯例的第三个国家主席任期，没有一人投反对票。
"Before Li Qiang was appointed China's No. 2 leader this past week, he oversaw Shanghai, a city that, for a time early last year, was celebrated for trying to contain Covid with relative restraint. City officials wanted to avoid the economic devastation of a full-scale lockdown and instead opted for limited restrictions that applied to, in one instance, a single milk tea shop.",上周被任命为中国政府的二号人物之前，李强掌管着上海，这座城市在去年初曾一度因相对克制的新冠疫情防疫措施而受到赞誉。市政府官员希望避免全面封锁给经济造成的破坏，选择了范围有限的限制措施，例如，对一家奶茶店实施了单独封锁。
"But as cases spread, the central government in Beijing intervened. Suddenly, the pragmatism and business-friendly character that had long defined Shanghai's spirit gave way to ""zero Covid,"" the top leader Xi Jinping's single-minded pursuit of eliminating the virus. Mr. Li, who vowed to ""firmly implement"" Mr. Xi's orders ""without hesitation,"" imposed a citywide lockdown that confined 25 million people to their homes for two months.","但随着疫情的蔓延，北京的中央政府进行了干预。突然之间，长期以来定义上海精神的实用主义和商业友好的特点让位于""清零""政策，这是最高领导人习近平对于消灭病毒一心一意的追求。李强誓言要""坚持'动态清零'总方针不犹豫不动摇""，实施了封城措施，将2500万人关在家中长达两个月。"
"Mr. Li's pivot in Shanghai demonstrated his loyalty to Mr. Xi, a quality that appears to have kept him close to the top leader for two decades and that culminated in his elevation to premier on Saturday. But it also shows how he is at the center of the tension between Mr. Xi's emphasis on authoritarian Communist control over society and the free market, business-friendly policies that underpinned China's rise.",李强在上海防疫上的转向显示出他对习近平的忠诚，这一点似乎让他在过去20年里一直与这位最高领导人保持着密切联系，并最终使他在周六被提拔到总理位置。但从中我们也可以看到，他处于一种紧张关系的中心，一头是习近平强调共产党对社会的威权主义控制，另一头是支撑中国崛起的自由市场和亲商政策。
The direction of the world's second-largest economy now depends on how these tensions play out.,世界第二大经济体何去何从，现在取决于这些紧张关系将如何发展。
"The party has sought to demonstrate that Mr. Li has Mr. Xi's trust. When Mr. Xi was reappointed as president at the National People's Congress last week, the two men were seen sitting next to each other on the stage, chatting animatedly. But the position of premier has also been diminished under Mr. Xi.",中共试图表明李强拥有习近平的信任。当习近平上周在全国人民代表大会上再次被任命为国家主席时，人们看到两人在主席台上相邻而坐，并热烈地交谈。但在习近平的领导下，总理的职位已遭到削弱。
"Mr. Li ""will only focus on domestic livelihood issues,"" said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, who specializes in political and economic issues in China. Mr. Xi will be in charge of virtually everything else.","新加坡李光耀公共政策学院专门研究中国政经问题的副教授吴木銮说，李强""将只关注国内民生问题""。习近平将负责几乎所有其他事情。"
"Even within that limited scope, Mr. Li faces serious challenges. To revitalize China's economy, he needs to restore confidence that had been battered by Covid restrictions as well as clampdowns on tech and real estate. Mr. Li, at his first news conference as premier on Monday, sought to reassure private companies of their importance to the party and Beijing's commitment to market-oriented economics, despite Mr. Xi's emphasis on national security and Communist ideology.",即使在这个有限的职责范围内，李强也面临着严峻的挑战。要重振中国经济，就需要恢复因新冠疫情限制措施以及科技和房地产被打压而受到重创的信心。尽管习近平强调国家安全和共产主义意识形态，但在周一的首次总理记者会上，李强试图向民营企业保证它们对党非常重要，以及北京对市场经济的承诺。
"Mr. Li pointed to his long experience working in cities and provinces with strong private businesses and entrepreneurs. ""I have some understanding of their aspirations and apprehensions in the course of their development,"" he said at the briefing.","李强指出，他长期在民营经济发达的省市工作。""我对他们发展中的期盼和顾虑还是比较了解的，""他在发布会上说。"
"Mr. Li's record points to a commitment to promoting business. As Shanghai's party secretary, he pushed successfully for the creation of another stock market in the city. Under Mr. Li's watch, Elon Musk built in Shanghai what is now Tesla's largest electric car factory. The factory began manufacturing cars in less than a year after construction crews took turns working around the clock under floodlights, as is common for priority projects in China.",李强的履历表明，他致力于促进商业发展。作为上海市委书记，他成功推动了上海另一个证券市场的诞生。在其领导下，伊隆·马斯克在上海建造了特斯拉目前最大的电动汽车厂。建筑工人轮班在泛光灯下昼夜不停地施工，不到一年的时间这家工厂就开始投产，这样的速度在中国的优先项目中很常见。
"At times, he has sounded like an advocate of free markets. ""When facing the market, the government must respond if there's a request, but must not disturb if there's nothing,"" he told the official Xinhua news agency in 2018.","有时，他听起来像是自由市场的倡导者。他在2018年对官方媒体新华社说:""面向市场时，政府要有求必应、无事不扰。"""
"Mr. Li, 63, spent his entire career until last autumn working his way up through a series of municipal and provincial administrations on China's prosperous eastern seaboard, along the way cultivating his relationship with Mr. Xi.",李强现年63岁，在去年秋天之前，他一直在中国繁荣的东部沿海地区担任省市级领导职务，并在此过程中与习近平建立了关系。
"He began his career in an irrigation station, then a tool factory in Rui'an, a county on the outskirts of Wenzhou, one of the most entrepreneurial cities in China. He worked his way up to the post of Communist Party leader of Wenzhou, a position he held for three years until 2004. Then Mr. Li moved to Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang, and became chief of staff for several years to Mr. Xi, the province's party leader then.",他的职业生涯始于温州郊区瑞安县的一个灌溉站，然后是一家工具厂，温州是中国最具企业家精神的城市之一。他一路晋升到温州市委书记，担任该职位三年，直到2004年。然后，李强被调到浙江省会杭州，担任省委秘书长，习近平时任省委书记。
"Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an American author, businessman and a host of a show on Chinese state television, visited Zhejiang Province on a book tour in 2005 and met Mr. Xi, and several of his aides, including Mr. Li. A year later, during an interview with Mr. Xi for another book, Mr. Kuhn found only Mr. Li at Mr. Xi's side.",美国作家、商人和中国国家电视台节目主持人罗伯特·劳伦斯·库恩于2005年在浙江做图书签售时见到了习近平和他的几名助手，其中包括李强。一年后，在为另一本书采访习近平时，库恩发现习近平身边只有李强。
"""He was not just there to carry his briefcase, he was very much engaged"" in the discussion, Mr. Kuhn recalled about the meeting, referring to Mr. Li. Mr. Kuhn said that Mr. Li was someone Mr. Xi ""trusted above all others, at least at that time.""","库恩回忆起那次会面时说，李强""不只是在那里给他提公文包，他非常投入地""参与讨论。库恩说，李强是习近平""最信任的人，至少在那个时候是这样""。"
"Mr. Li moved quickly up the ranks of the province's Communist Party after that, and only two months after Mr. Xi became China's top leader in 2012, he named Mr. Li as the governor of Zhejiang. Three years later, he promoted Mr. Li again, to become Communist Party secretary of Jiangsu Province, a prosperous hub of heavy industry just north of Zhejiang. And in 2017, he chose Mr. Li as Communist Party secretary of Shanghai long a steppingstone to the Standing Committee of the Politburo, including for Mr. Xi himself.",在那之后，李强在浙江快速晋升。2012年，习近平在成为中国最高领导人后仅两个月就任命李强为浙江省省长。三年后，他再次提拔李强，让他担任江苏省委书记，江苏位于浙江北部，是一个繁荣的重工业中心。2017年，他选择李强担任上海市委书记——这是进入政治局常委的跳板，包括习近平本人也曾担任过这个职位。
The big question that lies ahead for Mr. Li is whether he will retain the same access to Mr. Xi and influence in Beijing that he once had as a senior aide in the much smaller world of provincial government.,摆在李强面前的一大问题是，他是否能像当初在规模小得多的省级政府担任高级助手时那样，保持与习近平的密切接触，以及在北京获得自己的影响力。
"""You can't assume that because he was able to speak frankly to Xi in the past, that means he will be able to do so in the future,"" said Kenneth Jarrett, a former American diplomat and business leader in Shanghai who has met Mr. Li many times in Zhejiang and later in Shanghai.","""你不能假定因为他过去能够与习近平坦诚交谈，就意味着他将来也能如此，""前美国外交官、上海的商界领袖季瑞达(Kenneth Jarrett)说。他与李强曾多次见面，包括在浙江以及后来在上海。"
"There are apparent limitations to Mr. Li's influence on matters of national importance. At the start of the pandemic, Mr. Li played a key role in an agreement between BioNTech, a German biotech company, and Fosun Pharma, a private-sector pharmaceuticals company in Shanghai, to manufacture BioNTech's mRNA vaccines in Shanghai, said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.",李强在国家大事上的影响力显然有限。中国欧盟商会会长伍德克(Joerg Wuttke)说，在疫情开始时，李强在德国生物科技公司BioNTech与上海民营药企复星医药达成的一项在上海生产mRNA疫苗的协议中，发挥了关键作用。
"With Mr. Li's help, Fosun moved quickly tobuild a factory in Shanghai. By December 2020, the factory started to produce large quantities of an mRNA vaccine. But the vaccines were never certified for use, partly because of Beijing's obstructions, according to Mr. Wuttke.",在李强的帮助下，复星迅速在上海建厂。到2020年12月，工厂开始大量生产mRNA疫苗。但据伍德克的说法，这些疫苗始终没有拿到批文，部分原因是北京方面的阻挠。
"""He was a matchmaker, but the marriage was never consummated,"" said Mr. Wuttke.","""他撮合了这两个公司，但无果而终，""伍德克说。"
"Mr. Li's reputation was also badly hurt by the lockdown on Shanghai last spring, which was often chaotic and bungled, with some residents locked in their homes without access to food and critical medicines. The city was later also the site of rare protests against ""zero Covid"" and, specifically, Mr. Xi'sauthoritarian leadership.","去年春天上海封城也严重损害了李强的声誉，当时的封控经常搞得一团糟，一些民众困在家里，无法获得食物和救命的药物。罕见反对""清零""的抗议活动——特别是针对习近平的独裁领导——后来也出现在这座城市。"
"Mr. Li has since been credited with helping to lead the push in early December for China to quickly abandon its ""zero Covid"" policy, several people who know Mr. Li said in interviews in early January, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss elite Chinese politics.","几位认识李强的人士在1月初的采访中说，中国后来在12月初迅速放弃""清零""政策，要归功于李强的推动。这些讨论中国精英政治的受访者要求匿名。"
"Mr. Li's move should not be construed, however, as a broader sign of his sway in the central leadership, said Neil Thomas, an expert on Chinese elite politics. By then it was clear that the rapid spread of Omicron had made lockdowns and mass testing unsustainable and futile.",然而，研究中国精英政治的专家牛犇(Neil Thomas)表示，李强的举动不应被理解为他在中央领导层中拥有更广泛的影响力。在那个时候已经很明显了，奥密克戎的迅速传播使得封锁和大规模检测变得不可持续，而且毫无意义。
"""When it really counted for the Chinese economy, he wasn't able to convince Xi Jinping to reverse zero Covid,"" he said, referring to Mr. Li's deference to Beijing's authority during the Shanghai lockdowns.","说到李强在上海封城期间对北京权威的顺从时，他说:""在中国经济面临重大影响的时刻，他没能说服习近平放弃'清零'""。"
"""Xi is likely to listen seriously to what Li Qiang has to say about economic policy, but ultimately, Xi is still going to call the shots,"" Mr. Thomas added.","牛犇还说:""习近平可能会认真听取李强关于经济政策的讲话，但最终仍然是习近平做主。"""
"BEIJING China's new premier, the country's No. 2 leader after Xi Jinping, sought on Monday to reinvigorate confidence in the faltering economy, promising that private-sector companies would be treated equally with state-owned ones and that the property rights and other interests of entrepreneurs would be strictly respected.",北京——作为国家领导层中排名仅次于习近平的二号官员，中国新任总理李强在周一的记者会上试图重振人们对低迷经济的信心，承诺会平等对待民营企业和国有企业，并依法保护企业产权和企业家的其他利益。
"Premier Li Qiang, who took office on Saturday, strongly endorsed the role of entrepreneurs after a decade in which the state and the ruling Communist Party have played a steadily growing role in China's economy, with some pro-party commentators castigating big businesses. Weak confidence, spending and investment by consumers and private businesses have hurt the economy, which has slowed sharply over the past few years.",周六上任的李强总理对企业家的作用予以大力支持，在此前的十年里，执政的中共在中国经济中的作用一直在稳步增长，一些亲中共的评论人士对大企业严厉批评。消费者和民营企业的信心、开支和投资不足已给经济造成损害，使增长率在过去几年急剧放缓。
"The Communist Party is under immense pressure to revive growth, which was battered by nearly three years of ""zero Covid"" restrictions, including mass testing and quarantines. Lengthy city lockdowns that confined hundreds of millions of people to their homes disrupted factory production and left consumers and businesses alike with little confidence to spend.","中共承受着重振经济的巨大压力，近三年的新冠""清零""限制措施(包括大规模核酸检测和集中隔离)遏制了增长。对整座城市进行的长时间封控将上亿人困在家中，扰乱了工厂生产，让消费者和企业都没有信心花钱。"
"Even after the government lifted those pandemic rules in December, many entrepreneurs have been wary of making new investments. Some have even left the country as the climate for private businesses has deteriorated.","即使在政府去年12月取消了""清零""政策后，许多企业家仍对新投资持谨慎态度。随着民营企业在国内的经营环境恶化，一些人甚至离开了中国。"
"The state-led banking system has been steering more loans in recent years to state-owned enterprises. Government-controlled construction companies have squeezed out many private real estate developers. The Communist Party has insisted on a larger role in the decision-making of private companies. And many local governments have forced private companies to make large ""donations"" or pay arbitrarily imposed fines to help cover the costs of social programs.","近年来，中国政府主导的银行系统一直在引导更多的贷款流向国有企业。政府掌管的建筑公司已将许多民营地产商挤出市场。中共坚持要在民营企业的生产经营决策过程中起更大作用。许多地方政府还强迫民营企业拿出大笔""捐款""、或缴付随意开出的罚单来帮助支付社会项目的费用。"
"Speaking on Monday at his first news conference as premier, Mr. Li delivered the most forceful statement by a Chinese leader in years of the need to preserve the vitality of the private sector. He promised a commercial environment ""in which businesses of all forms of ownership will be treated equally, protecting the property rights and interests of entrepreneurs according to the law, encouraging fair competition between business entities of all types.""","周一，在就任总理后的首次记者会上讲话时，李强对有必要保持民营部门的活力给出了中国领导人多年来最强有力的表态。他承诺营造""平等对待各类所有制企业，依法保护企业产权和企业家权益，促进各类经营主体公平竞争""的营商环境。"
"He offered no specifics about reviving the economy. He cautioned that even China's goal of 5 percent growth this year, the lowest target in decades, would not be easy to achieve, particularly at a time when many other countries also face significant economic challenges.",他没有提供如何重振经济的具体做法。他警告，即使是中国制定的今年经济增长5%的目标(这是几十年来的最低目标)，实现起来也不容易，尤其是在世界上许多其他国家也面临重大经济挑战的时候。
"But he offset short-term concerns about growth by making a case for China's continued economic strengths. ""There is the massive scale of its market, its comprehensive array of industries, abundant human resources, and a robust base for development even more important, there are our clear institutional advantages,"" he said, apparently referring to Communist Party rule.","但他认为，中国经济的长期优势条件将弥补短期的担忧。""市场规模巨大，产业体系完备，人力资源丰富，发展基础厚实等，更重要的是制度优势显著，""他说，最后一句显然是指中共的统治。"
"Mr. Li's remarks triggered a sharp jump on Monday morning in share prices in Hong Kong and a smaller but notable increase in mainland China, even as markets elsewhere in Asia fell on worries about government takeovers of two troubled banks in the United States.",李强的话导致香港股市周一上午大幅上涨，中国大陆股市的涨幅较小，但也值得注意，因为亚洲其他地区的股市出于对美国政府接管两家陷入困境的银行的担忧都出现了下跌。
"Mr. Li's comments were particularly noteworthy because he, unlike his predecessor, is seen as a close ally of Mr. Xi, who has overseen the ever-expanding role of the Communist Party in daily life and who has tended to emphasize security over economic growth.",李强的说法尤其值得注意，因为他被视为习近平的亲密盟友，这与外界对其前任的看法不同。习近平掌管着中共在日常生活中不断扩大的作用，他更倾向于强调国家安全而不是经济增长。
"Mr. Xi delivered brief remarks before Mr. Li at the close of the nine-day annual session of China's largely ceremonial, Communist Party-controlled legislature, the National People's Congress. Mr. Xi did not mention the country's economic challenges, focusing to a considerable extent on the need for security and stability.",中国的立法机构、由中共控制的全国人大基本上是一个摆设，在其为期九天的年度会议结束时，习近平在李强之前发表了简短讲话。习近平没有提到中国的经济挑战，而是把主要的注意力放在了强调国家安全和稳定的必要性上。
"The difference in tone and substance between the two men's comments suggested that Mr. Xi would leave the details of economic policy to the premier, while Mr. Xi would play the role of the paternalistic Communist Party leader who provides security for the people but is not directly responsible for the month-to-month vicissitudes of the economy.",两人的讲话在语气和实质内容上的差别表明，习近平将把经济政策的细节留给总理，而他本人则扮演家长式中共领导人的角色，为人民提供安全保障，但不直接对经济的逐月变化负责。
"Many business leaders in China have been worried as Mr. Xi's emphasis on national security has been used to justify greater party involvement in private companies' affairs, as well as strong pressure on businesses to cooperate with the military under a so-called ""civil-military fusion"" policy. But Mr. Xi repeated his case that emphasizing national security was fully consistent with economic progress.","中国的许多商界领袖一直担心，习近平对国家安全的强调已成为中共更多介入民企事务的理由，以及民企承受着强大压力需要按照所谓的""军民融合发展""政策与军方合作的原因。但习近平重申了他的观点，即强调国家安全与经济发展完全一致。"
"""Security is the foundation of development, and stability is the precondition for strength and prosperity,"" Mr. Xi said.","""安全是发展的基础，稳定是强盛的前提，""习近平说。"
"Mr. Xi and Foreign Minister Qin Gang both delivered strong criticisms of the United States early last week, accusing it of seeking to contain China. But when asked on Monday about Sino-American relations, Mr. Li steered clear of geopolitical issues and of any direct criticism of the United States government, choosing instead to endorse free trade and commercial cooperation.",习近平和外交部长秦刚都在上周早些时候对美国提出强烈批评，指责美国试图遏制中国。但在周一被问及中美关系时，李强避开了地缘政治问题和对美国政府的任何直接批评，而是选择强调自由贸易和商业合作。
"""Opening up to the outside is our fundamental national policy, and no matter how the international situation changes, we will be unwavering in advancing it,"" he said.","""对外开放是我们的基本国策，无论外部形势怎么变，我们都将坚定不移向前推进，""他说。"
"Mr. Li even suggested that Mr. Xi and President Biden follow up on various understandings they reached during a November meeting in Bali, Indonesia, before the flight of a Chinese spy balloon across the United States led once more to a souring of bilateral relations.",李强甚至暗示，习近平和拜登总统继续推进他们去年11月在印度尼西亚巴厘岛会晤时达成的各种谅解，那是在中国间谍气球飞越美国导致双边关系进一步恶化之前。
"The premier's news conference with foreign and local journalists at the end of the annual legislative session is presented as a demonstration of political accountability. But the leadership screens questions beforehand, to ensure that no topics that China's leaders do not want to address publicly are raised.",李强在全国人大年度会议结束时与中外记者举行记者会的做法被宣传为政治责任制的体现。但记者会上提的问题经过了领导层的事先筛选，以确保不出现中国领导人不想公开讨论的话题。
"China's leaders have taken several steps during the nine-day session to reassure businesses and investors. Mr. Xi, who has sought to tighten the party's grip over the economy and private businesses, told business leaders that the party embraced private companies as ""one of us.""","中国领导人在全国人大的九天会议期间出台了多项安抚企业和投资者的措施。一直寻求加强中共对经济和民营企业控制的习近平对商界领袖说，中共将民营企业家视为""自己人""。"
"In a move seen as signaling continuity, the party retained the leaders of the central bank, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance, ending weeks of speculation that Mr. Xi would replace them with a new and possibly less experienced generation of economic policy managers.",央行、商务部和财政部的负责人得以留任，结束了几周来人们对习近平会启用新一代、可能缺乏经验的经济政策管理者取代他们的猜测。留任的做法被视为延续性的标志。
"""This raft of appointments seems to at least partially buck the narrative that demonstrated fealty to Xi Jinping will trump technocratic competence in assigning top-level government positions,"" said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist.","""政府任命的许多人似乎至少部分地反驳了一种叙事，即从政府高层的职位安排来看，对习近平表示忠诚将比技术官僚的能力重要，""康奈尔大学经济学家埃斯瓦尔·普拉萨德说。"
"Some signs of economic recovery have emerged. Surveys of purchasing managers suggest that factory activity accelerated strongly in February. In many Chinese cities, the subways, airports and hotels are busy once more.",经济复苏的一些迹象已经出现。对采购经理的调查表明，今年2月的工厂活动反弹速度加快。在中国的许多城市，地铁、机场和酒店再次变得繁忙起来。
"But youth unemployment remains high, and the housing market is in a slump. China's factories, the engine of its trade with the world, are facing weakening demand from the United States and Europe.",但年轻人失业率仍居高不下，房地产市场仍不景气。作为中国与世界贸易引擎的中国工厂正面临着美国和欧洲的需求减弱的问题。
"Construction, another mainstay of the Chinese economy, has slackened because of a slow-motion housing market crash, and this in turn has hurt demand for steel, cement and other materials. China plans to release on Wednesday a wide range of data on industrial production, real estate development, retail sales and other economic activity during January and February.",建筑业是中国经济的另一个支柱，受房地产市场慢速崩溃的影响，该行业一直不景气，这进一步减弱了对钢铁、水泥和其他材料的需求。中国计划在本周三发布今年1月和2月的工业生产、房地产开发、零售销售额和其他经济活动的更广泛数据。
A real estate market that is threatening the financial system and holding back the economy. A tech industry that is being targeted by aggressive U.S. efforts to cut it off from the world. Tech companies that are trying to keep pace with fast-moving developments in artificial intelligence.,这个国家的房地产市场威胁着金融体系并阻碍了经济发展。它的科技行业正在成为美国强势行动的目标，后者试图将其与世界其他地区隔绝。这里的科技公司试图跟上人工智能的快速发展步伐。
"As its trade and economic rivalry with the West has intensified, China has launched a government overhaul intended to address some of its biggest stated priorities. A series of changes handed down from the highest reaches of the government were approved Friday at the annual gathering of the country's legislature. That body, the National People's Congress, also confirmed Xi Jinping for a third term as China's president.",随着与西方的贸易和经济竞争愈演愈烈，中国启动了政府改革，旨在解决一些最重要的既定优先事项。周五，在该国立法机构的年度会议上，政府最高层下达的一系列改革措施获得批准。全国人民代表大会也确认了习近平的第三个中国国家主席任期。
"The moves reflect broader changes by Mr. Xi to centralize Communist Party control throughout the government. Several regulatory agencies are being realigned to stabilize the financial sector, which faces a potential onslaught of losses from loans made to troubled real estate developers. In another key change, the central government's bank regulator will start playing a bigger role in supervising thousands of fast-growing local banks, which continue to make many of the riskiest loans.",这些举措反映了习近平为将共产党的控制权集中到整个政府而进行的更广泛的变革。一些监管机构正在重新调整以稳定金融部门，该部门因曾向陷入困境的房地产开发商发放贷款而面临巨大亏损。另一项重大变化是，中央政府的银行监管机构将开始在监管数千家快速发展的地方银行方面发挥更大作用，这些银行继续发放许多风险极高的贷款。
"To boost tech, China's primary scientific policy agencyis being refocused on Mr. Xi's goal of having China make its own advanced semiconductors and not rely on imports.",为了推动科技发展，中国的主要科学政策机构正在重新关注习近平的目标，即让中国制造自己的先进半导体，而不是依赖进口。
"In the battle over tech prowess, the United States, Japan and the Netherlands have imposed limits on the sale of equipment used to make such microchips, which Western countries worry will be used by the Chinese military.",在技术实力的较量中，美国、日本和荷兰对此类微芯片的生产设备施加了销售限制，西方国家担心这些设备会被中国军方使用。
"Mr. Xi bluntly warned on Monday that ""Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-around containment, encirclement and suppression of China.""","习近平周一不客气地警告，""以美国为首的西方国家对我实施了全方位的遏制、围堵、打压。"""
Here are three main areas where China is reordering government oversight.,中国正在以下三个主要领域重新安排政府监管。
Financial regulation is changing to tackle a rolling real estate crisis.,金融监管改革以应对持续不断的房地产危机。
"China is in the middle of a slow-motion housing crash that could ripple through its banks. Dozens of real estate developers have defaulted on their debts to investors overseas. Nobody knows for sure what the risks are for China's banks, which have lent heavily to the real estate sector, but the fallout is expected to continue.",中国正在经历一场缓慢的房地产崩盘，可能波及银行。数十家房开商在对海外投资者的债务上违约。没有人确切知道向房地产行业提供大量贷款的中国银行面临的风险有多大，但预计其影响将继续存在。
"In response, Beijing is strengthening what has been known as the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. It is being renamed the State Administration of Financial Supervision, and municipal regulators will cede their authority to the national officials. The State Administration of Financial Supervision will wield a much bigger role in overseeing small, local banks, which represent nearly half the country's banking market.",作为回应，北京正在加强中国银行保险监督管理委员会。该机构将更名为国家金融监督管理总局，地方监管机构会将权力交给国家官员。国家金融监管总局将在监管小型地方银行方面发挥更大的作用，这些银行占中国银行业市场的近一半。
"Alicia Garcia-Herrero, the chief economist for Asia and the Pacific at Natixis, a French investment bank, said that the centralization suggested preparations to reorder the banking sector. ""That level of concentration of power to me is only explained by and this is the key a massive restructuring coming,"" she said.","法国投行法国外贸银行亚太区首席经济学家艾西亚·加西亚-埃雷罗表示，集权化表明准备对银行业进行重组。""对我来说，这种权力集中程度的唯一解释——这很关键——是即将到来的大规模重组，""她说。"
"The new agency will also take responsibility from the central bank the People's Bank of China for the protection of consumers and investors. The central bank will also reopen offices around the country that it had closed in a previous reorganization, providing further scrutiny of local financial institutions.",新机构还将承担中央银行中国人民银行保护消费者和投资者的责任。中央银行还将重新开放其在之前的重组中关闭的各地分行，以进一步审查当地金融机构。
"The difficulty with replacing local officials with national officials is that local officials may have a better understanding of financial conditions in their towns and be able to stop fraudulent investment schemes, said Victor Shih, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego. But officials with local ties may also be more easily influenced by bank managers to ignore misconduct.",加州大学圣地亚哥分校政治学家史宗瀚(Victor Shih)表示，用国家官员取代地方官员的困难在于，地方官员可能更了解他们所在城镇的金融状况，并能够阻止投资诈骗。但与地方有联系的官员也可能更容易受到银行经理的影响而忽视不当行为。
"The National Development and Reform Commission, China's powerful central planning agency, will separately relinquish its oversight of the sale of corporate bonds, which are a form of borrowing. That duty will now fall to the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which already oversees the bond trading.",掌握重权的中央计划机构国家发展和改革委员会将放弃对企业债券发行的监管，企业债券是一种借贷形式。该职责现在将划入已经在负责监管债券交易的中国证券监督管理委员会。
The Ministry of Science and Technology is being streamlined to give it more control over funding.,经过优化的科学技术部将对拨款有更多控制权。
"China is bestowing more clout on its science and technology ministry. The plan would give the ministry more control over how government science funds are spent. Officials believe that heavier top-down supervision of innovation, from the people involved to the research conducted, will produce critical breakthroughs in high-end computer chips.",中国正在赋予科学技术部更大的影响力。改革计划将使科技部在如何使用政府科学基金方面拥有更多控制权。官员们认为，从参与创新的人员到进行的研究，对创新加强自上而下的监管将在高端计算机芯片领域取得重大突破。
"Some of the ministry's other responsibilities outside of high-tech, such as developing advances in agriculture, will be transferred to other ministries.",科技部在高科技之外的一些其他职责，如开发农业技术，将被移交给其他部门。
"A new science and technology committee under the Communist Party will be installed at the ministry, part of Mr. Xi's efforts to expand the party's reach over the state bureaucracy.",科技部将设立一个新的、由共产党领导的中央科技委员会，这是习近平为扩大党在国家官僚机构中的影响力所做的努力。
"""The attention being given to the science and technology bureaucracy appears to be a renewed focus on hard tech, like chips, the type of things the U.S. and allies are currently cutting China off from,"" said Graham Webster, the editor in chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center.","""对科技官僚机构的关注似乎是对芯片等硬技术的重新关注，美国及其盟友目前正在切断中国获取这类东西的途径，""斯坦福大学网络政策中心数字中国项目主编格雷厄姆·韦伯斯特说。"
A National Data Bureau will centralize how data is managed.,国家数据局将集中管理数据。
"China announced the construction of a National Data Bureau on Tuesday, reflecting China's commitment to data and artificial intelligence as fundamental drivers of its future economy.",中国于周二宣布建立国家数据局，这反映了中国致力于将数据和人工智能作为未来经济的根本驱动力。
"The new bureau will consolidate efforts that were once the remit of multiple agencies. It will be overseen by the National Development and Reform Commission, and will support things like the building of a national infrastructure to transmit data.",新成立的数据局将整合曾经由多个机构分管的工作。它将由国家发展和改革委员会监督，并向建设国家数据传输基础设施等工作提供支持。
"""The debut of the Data Bureau is a perfect echo of top leaders' pledge to ensure both development and security of China's data-related issues,"" said Bruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle, the global real estate and investment advisory firm.","""国家数据局的成立完美地呼应了最高领导人确保中国数据相关问题发展与安全的承诺，""全球房地产和投资咨询公司仲量联行大中华区首席经济学家庞溟表示。"
"Data raises fraught issues in China it is central to the development of cutting-edge technologies, but also seen by the authorities as a strategic resource that must be tightly minded.",数据在中国引发了令人担忧的问题——它是尖端技术发展的核心，但也被当局视为必须严加控制的战略资源。
"Under Mr. Xi, the country has expanded its control over data in the name of national security. As part of a crackdown in 2021, China unrolled new rules governing how companies collect and manage data. Analysts expect the oversight of personal data and cybersecurity to mostly remain the purview of China's powerful internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China.",在习近平的领导下，中国以国家安全的名义扩大了对数据的控制。作为2021年一项打击行动的一部分，中国出台了管理企业如何收集和管理数据的新规。分析人士预计，对个人数据和网络安全的监管基本上仍将是中国强大的互联网监管机构国家互联网信息办公室的职责范围。
"China views data as the backbone of its economy in the future. In November, the country opened a data exchange in Shenzhen, a market similar to a securities exchange but where brokers and buyers instead trade different kinds of data. Just as stock markets can enable valuable companies to find investors, the new Shenzhen exchange is supposed to determine the most productive use of data across the economy.",中国将数据视为未来经济的支柱。去年11月，中国在深圳开设了一个数据交易所，类似于证券交易所，但经纪人和买家在这里交易不同类型的数据。就像股市可以让有价值的公司找到投资者一样，新成立的深圳交易所用来决定整个经济中如何最有效地利用数据。
"""The government is interested in figuring out what data it has and how to extract value from that data,"" said Tom Nunlist, a tech analyst at Trivium China, a Beijing-based research firm. The new bureau reflects ""the culmination of a national data strategy to manage and deploy data at a centralized level,"" he added.","""政府感兴趣的是弄清楚自己拥有哪些数据，以及如何从这些数据中提取价值，""总部位于北京的研究公司策纬咨询的科技分析师汤姆·农利斯特说。他还表示，新的数据局意味着""集中管理和部署数据的国家数据战略达到了极致""。"
"Li Qiang, a longtime ally of China's top leader and the man who oversaw last year's bruising two-month Covid lockdown of Shanghai, was formally appointed the country's premier on Saturday. He will face the challenge of trying to revive the economy, which is languishing from three years of Covid restrictions.","李强周六被正式任命为中国总理。他是中国最高领导人的长期盟友，曾于去年执掌上海为期两个月的痛苦""清零""封锁。他将面临试图重振经济的挑战，中国经济因三年的新冠限制促使而受到重创。"
"As premier, Mr. Li is now China's No. 2 leader and the top bureaucrat leading the country's cabinet and wielding broad authority over economic policy. The position has weakened under Xi Jinping, the top leader, who was widely seen to have sidelined the outgoing premier, Li Keqiang. But some analysts say that Li Qiang may play a larger though not necessarily more influential role than his predecessor.",作为总理，李强现在在中国的领导人中排名第二位，他也是中国的头号官僚，领导国务院，对经济政策行使广泛权力。总理的职位已在中国最高领导人习近平的领导下有所削弱，外界普遍认为习近平把刚刚卸任的李克强总理排除在核心之外。但有些分析人士说，李强也许会比他的前任起到更大作用，虽然不一定会有更大的影响力。
"The government has said it expects to expand the economy by ""around 5 percent"" this year, a modest goal that most likely points to the difficulty of resolving the housing market slump, slowing exports and rising debt. Youth unemployment is high. Chinese companies face the threat of cripplingeconomic sanctionsby the United States and its allies.","中国政府曾表示，预计该国今年经济将增长""5%左右""，这一保守的目标很可能表明解决房地产市场低迷、出口放缓和债务增加的问题存在困难。目前该国青年失业率很高。中国公司面临美国及其盟友严厉经济制裁的威胁。"
"Li Qiang, the former Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, was elevated last fall to be the No. 2 official in the Chinese Communist Party, probably a product of his perceived loyalty to Mr. Xi. He carried out thelockdown of Shanghaiin the name of Mr. Xi's ""zero Covid"" policy of eradicating the virus, despite the enormous economic and social cost it exacted on the city, partly as a result ofmismanagement that led to food shortages.","李强曾任上海市委书记，于去年秋天被提升为中共二号人物，这很可能是因为习近平认可他的忠诚。他执行了习近平以根除病毒为名的新冠""清零""政策，尽管这给这座城市带来了巨大的经济和社会成本，部分原因是导致了食品短缺的管理不善。"
"Mr. Li's experience leading economically important regions in addition to Shanghai, he also held top posts in affluent Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces has fueled some hopes that he will promote business-friendly policies. But he lacks experience in Beijing, which could make him more reliant on Mr. Xi's continued support, and less likely to raise policies at odds with the top leader's wishes.",李强在经济重要地区担任领导人的经验——除了上海，他还在富裕的浙江省和江苏省担任过要职——让一些人对他将推出有利于商业的政策充满希望。但他缺乏在中央工作的经验，这可能会让他更多地依赖于习近平的继续支持，因此不太可能提出不符合最高领导人意愿的政策。
"Mr. Li's new position was confirmed on Saturday at the annual meeting of China's rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress. On Monday, at the end of the congress, he will make his public debut as premier at a news conference with vetted questions.",李强的新职位于周六在中国橡皮图章立法机构全国人民代表大会的年度会议上得到确认。周一会议结束时，他将在新闻发布会上以总理身份首次公开亮相，并回答一些经过审查的问题。
The congress will elevate new leaders for the first time in five years many of them Mr. Xi's loyalists.,此次大会将在五年内首次提拔一批新领导人——其中许多人是习近平的忠实拥护者。
Here's a look at the lineup:,这里是下届政府班子的阵容:
The President,国家主席
"China's top leader, Xi Jinping, was confirmed to a norm-breaking third term as state president on Friday.",中国最高领导人习近平打破常规的国家主席第三个任期周五得到了确认。
"The announcement was no surprise: Mr. Xioversaw the abolitionof presidential term limits in 2018, and in October he secured a third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party, the position from which his real authority derives. The vote by the National People's Congress further formalized Mr. Xi's position as China's most dominant leader in decades.",这一消息并不令人意外:习近平在2018年主持取消了国家主席任期限制，而且，他已在去年10月获得了中共中央总书记的第三个任期，那是赋予他实权的职位。全国人民代表大会的投票进一步确立了习近平作为中国几十年来最具统治力的领导人的地位。
"As he starts his third term as president, Mr. Xi has signaled that he will focus on strengthening security and seeking self-sufficiency in strategic technologies to push back harder against what he perceives as an effort by the United States to block China's rise.",随着开启他的第三个国家主席任期，习近平已发出信号，表示他将重点加强安全和寻求战略技术的自给自足，以更强有力地反击他认为美国阻止中国崛起的努力。
"""Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-around containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country's development,"" Mr. Xi said ina speechon Monday.","""以美国为首的西方国家对我实施了全方位的遏制、围堵、打压，给我国发展带来前所未有的严峻挑战。""习近平在周一的一次讲话中说道。"
Executive Vice Premier,国务院常务副总理
"The executive vice premier is the highest-ranked of China's vice premiers, the officials directly under Mr. Xi and his No. 2. This post is expected to go to Ding Xuexiang, who for the past few years has served as a secretary and chief of staff to Mr. Xi.",副总理是习近平和中共二号人物的直接下属，其中级别最高的是常务副总理。这个职位预计将由丁薛祥担任。过去几年里，丁薛祥一直在习近平手下担任中共中央书记处书记和国家主席办公室主任。
"In this role, Mr. Ding is also likely to be responsible for domestic economic policy. The outgoing executive vice premier, Han Zheng, was a former Communist Party secretary of Shanghai credited with guiding that city's transformation into a cosmopolitan financial capital. Mr. Ding, by contrast, has never led a province, working largely as a behind-the-scenes technocrat.",担任常务副总理的丁薛祥可能也会负责国内经济政策。即将卸任的常务副总理韩正曾任上海市委书记，在上海转型为一个国际金融都市方面功不可没。相比之下，丁薛祥从未担任过省级领导人，主要是在后台从事技术官僚工作。
"But like others slated for promotion, Mr. Ding has longstanding ties with Mr. Xi. He is widely believed to be the office director for China's National Security Commission, a secretive body that has grown more influential as Mr. Xi has emphasized the need for vigilance against foreign and domestic threats. He has also frequently traveled with Mr. Xi, both domestically and overseas.",但与其他即将晋升的人一样，丁薛祥与习近平有着长期的关系。他被普遍认为是中央国家安全委员会的办公室主任，随着习近平强调有必要对国内外威胁保持警惕，这个秘密委员会的影响力已越来越大。丁薛祥也经常陪同习近平去国内外访问。
"Mr. Han, the current executive vice premier, was named China's vice president, a largely ceremonial role.",现任常务副总理韩正已被任命为中国国家副主席，这主要是个象征性的职务。
Head of the Legislature,全国人大常委会委员长
"Zhao Leji, named No. 3 in the party hierarchy last fall, was approved on Friday as the head of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.",去年秋天晋升为中共三把手的赵乐际周五被任命为中国立法机构全国人大常委会委员长。
"The legislature nominally has the power to make laws and amend the Constitution, though decisions are in reality made by top party officials. Mr. Zhao has kept a relatively low profile, but his responsibilities in recent years have been weighty: He has led the party's discipline inspection commission, in charge of implementing Mr. Xi's campaign against official corruption and disloyalty.",虽然中国的立法机构在名义上有制定法律、修改宪法的权力，但实际上的决策权掌握在中共领导层手中。赵乐际一直保持着相对低的姿态，但他近年来职责重大:他领导着中央纪律检查委员会，负责执行习近平打击官员腐败和不忠的运动。
"That campaign has been key to Mr. Xi's consolidation of power and purging of rivals. Before taking on the disciplinary role in 2017, Mr. Zhao was a top official in charge of party personnel issues, giving him deep experience in the party's internal affairs.",这场运动对习近平巩固权力、清洗对手很重要。2017年担任中央纪律检查委员会书记之前，赵乐际曾是负责党内人事工作的高级官员，这让他对党内事务有着深厚的经验。
Head of Political Advisory Body,全国政协主席
"At the same time as the annual legislative meeting, another group, which acts as a political advisory group to the government, also meets in Beijing. This group, called the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, will now be led by Wang Huning, the No. 4 Communist Party official.",在全国人大举行年度会议的同时，为政府提供咨询的全国政协也在北京举行年度会议。这个全名为中国人民政治协商会议的机构将由中共四号官员王沪宁领导。
"In this role, Mr. Wang will oversee about 2,000 representatives who ostensibly offer political and social policy suggestions; in reality, the conference works more as a soft power force for the party, mobilizing resources and nonparty members across Chinese society to back the party's agenda.",作为全国政协主席，王沪宁领导着大约2000名代表，他们表面上的作用是提供政治和社会政策方面的建议;但实际上，全国政协的作用更像是为中共行使软实力，动员中国社会各阶层的非党员和资源来支持中共的议程。
"Mr. Wang is known as the party's chief ideologist: He has served three consecutive top leaders in creating propaganda and writing speeches and policies. He helped shape Mr. Xi's motto of the ""Chinese Dream"" a vision of national rejuvenation, shepherded by Mr. Xi and his political rise signals the continuation of the party's hard-line, anti-Western policies.","王沪宁有中共意识形态总管的名声:先后在三名最高领导人手下工作，负责起草宣传、讲话和政策文件。他帮助提出了习近平提出的""中国梦""愿景，即在习近平领导下实现中华民族伟大复兴。王沪宁政治上的升迁意味着中共将继续与西方对抗的强硬政策。"
Economic Czar,经济工作主管
"Working closely with Mr. Li, the new premier, on reviving China's economy will be He Lifeng, another trusted former aide to Mr. Xi.",在重振中国经济方面与新总理李强密切配合的将是习近平信赖的另一名前助手何立峰。
"Mr. He, who is expected to become a vice premier overseeing economic and industrial policy, is the current head of China's National Development and Reform Commission, the country's economic policy planning committee. In that role, he has overseen the drafting of China's five-year plans and large investment projects both at home and overseas.",何立峰现任中国国家发展和改革委员会主任，有望成为主管经济和产业政策的副总理。发改委负责中国的经济政策规划，在担任发改委主任期间，何立峰主持了中国的五年计划起草工作，以及国内外的大型投资项目。
"Compared with the outgoing economic czar, Liu He a Harvard-educated economist who also led trade negotiations with Washington Mr. He has had little overseas exposure. He worked for 25 years in southern China's Fujian Province, including on and off with Mr. Xi when he was rising through the ranks there, and then became deputy Communist Party secretary in the megacity of Tianjin.",与即将离任的经济工作主管刘鹤相比，何立峰缺乏海外经历。刘鹤曾在哈佛大学学习，主持过与美国的贸易谈判。何立峰曾在南部的福建省工作过25年(在那期间，习近平也曾在福建省工作，并不断受到提拔)。何立峰曾先后多次与习近平共事。他后来担任过直辖市天津的市委副书记。
"His close ties to Mr. Xi suggest that he will be crucial to carrying out the leader's vision of a security-oriented, state-led society, where economic growth comes second to ideology.",何立峰与习近平的密切关系表明，他将在实现最高领导人把国家安全作为重点、让国家主导社会的愿景上起到至关重要的作用，在习近平的愿景中，意识形态的重要性高于经济发展。
"Xi Jinping solidified his status as China's most powerful leader in decades by sweeping into a new term as president on Friday, as he steels the country for an era of superpower rivalry and seeks to revive a battered economy.",周五，习近平开启了新一届国家主席任期，巩固了自己作为中国数十年来最强势领导人的地位，同时，他也让中国为超级大国竞争的时代做好准备，并寻求重振遭受重创的经济。
"The unanimous vote on the presidency by the Communist Party-controlled legislature formalized Mr. Xi's continued dominance of Chinese politics after he had alreadyclaimed a fresh termas party leader in October. He will keep holding the three main crowns of power in China party, military and state with no rivals or potential successors vying for attention.",习近平已在去年10月再次连任总书记，由中共控制的立法机关全票通过的国家主席选举结果则正式确定了他对中国政坛的持续主宰。他将继续集党、军、政的最高权力于一身，且没有政敌或引人注目的潜在继任者。
"With his personal power secure, Mr. Xi, 69, is now casting himself as the strong leader that China needs in a hostile world, dismissive of the criticisms that his autocratic style is adding to the country's dangers.",随着个人权力的稳固，现年69岁的习近平眼下正把自己塑造成中国在敌对的国际环境中所需的强人领袖，对其独裁作风令国家面临更多危机的批评不屑一顾。
"The party's heavy-handed pursuit of ""zero Covid"" dragged on the economy,set off rare, widespread protestsand added to investor worries about the country's long-term growth prospects. Under Mr. Xi, China's relations with the West have become increasingly strained, especially over Beijing's risingpressure on Taiwanand Chinesecloseness to Russiathroughout the war in Ukraine.","中共严厉执行""新冠清零""政策拖累了经济，引发了罕见的大规模抗议，并加剧了投资者对中国长期增长前景的担忧。在习近平的领导下，中国与西方的关系越来越紧张，尤其考虑到北京对台湾的压力不断增加，且在乌克兰战争期间中国与俄罗斯保持着密切关系。"
"The Communist Party has used a meeting of the National People's Congress, the legislature, in Beijing to urge the nation to rally behind Mr. Xi. At a meeting with business leaders this week, Mr. Xisuggested that Western animosity was to blamefor some of China's economic troubles and took the rare step of openly accusing the United States of ""all-around containment, encirclement and suppression.""","在立法机关人民代表大会在北京举行会议之际，中共号召全国人民团结在习近平周围。在本周与商界领袖的会谈中，习近平称西方的敌意是导致中国经济陷入困境的原因之一，并罕见地公开指责美国的""全方位遏制、围堵、打压""。"
"""In the coming period, the risks and challenges that we're facing will only become more and more numerous and grim,"" Mr. Xitold the business leaders, members of an advisory council.He urged officials to remain ""calm and focused"" while also braced for ""struggle.""","""未来一个时期，我们面临的风险挑战只会越来越多、越来越严峻，""习近平对政协的工商界领袖说道。他敦促官员要""沉着冷静、保持定力""，同时还要为""斗争""做好准备。"
Mr. Xi is poised to installhis trusted officialsto a new government lineup that will carry out his agenda of reviving growth and guarding China against threats at home and abroad. He has sought to assure jittery private businesses that the party embraces them. He initiated agovernmentreorganization intended to better control financial risks and encourage more homegrown scientific innovation.,为了执行他的议程，也就是恢复经济增长、保护国家免受国内外威胁，习近平准备将亲信官员安插到新一届政府班子。他试图向风声鹤唳的民企保证，它们会得到党的支持。他启动了政府机构的重组，以便更好地控制金融风险，鼓励更多的本土科学创新。
"But Mr. Xi's messages can be mixed, if not contradictory.",但习近平传递的信号就算不是自相矛盾，也可能喜忧参半。
"Even as he extended a friendly hand to private businesses, describing them as ""one of us,"" he has reminded them that they must serve the party's priorities, including in national security and rural development. Mr. Xi's warnings against the West may help to solidify support at home, but a more pugnacious stance risks escalating tensions with Washington and undercutting China's economic recovery.","尽管他向民企伸出友好之手，称他们是""自己人""，但还是提醒它们，民企必须为党的优先事项服务，包括国家安全和农村发展。习近平对西方发出的警告或许有助于他巩固国内的支持，但更加好斗的立场可能也会加剧与华盛顿的紧张关系，削弱中国的经济复苏。"
"""This period is going to be an important one for seeing whether Xi is repentant or unbowed. I wouldn't expect him to change a lot of the essentials,""Christopher K. Johnson, a former C.I.A. analyst who is a senior fellow at the Asia Society's Center for China Analysis, said in an interview. ""Xi is not on a 'charm offensive' where he is looking to correct the error of his ways.""","""这一时期对于看出习近平到底是在后悔还是绝不低头将会非常重要。我预计他不会改变很多基本的东西，""中央情报局前分析师、亚洲协会中国分析中心高级研究员张克斯(Christopher K. Johnson)在接受采访时说。""习近平并没有在进行想要纠正自己错误做法的'魅力攻势'。"""
"For now at least, Mr. Xi has signaled that he is prepared to push back against the United States over its sanctions and restrictions on Chinese firms and its expanding military deployments around Asia. The National People's Congress is set to approve anincrease of 7.2 percentto China's military spending this year, enhancing the potential of the People's Liberation Army to project power far from Chinese shores.",至少就目前而言，习近平已经表明了他准备就美国对中国企业的制裁和限制，以及美国在亚洲各地不断扩大的军事部署进行反击。全国人民代表大会批准将今年的军费开支增加7.2%，加强了人民解放军在远离中国海岸之处的部署潜力。
"Mr. Xi and President Biden had been moving to rein in tensions, but their efforts have been overtaken by disputesover a Chinese surveillance balloonand theBiden administration's accusationthat Beijing was considering sending lethal support for Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. The Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang, said this week that Beijing ""has not provided weapons to either side of the conflict.""","习近平和拜登总统一直在努力控制紧张局势，但他们的努力被围绕中国侦查气球的争端，以及拜登政府对北京正考虑向在乌克兰作战的俄军提供致命性支持的指控所取代。中国外交部长秦刚本周表示，中国""没有向冲突的任何一方提供武器""。"
"To minimize China's external vulnerabilities, Mr. Xi has emphasized reducing reliance on Western-held technologies and expertise, and fortifying the country against threats to food and energy security.",为了最大限度地减少中国的外部脆弱性，习近平强调要摆脱对西方技术和专业知识的依赖，加强对粮食和能源安全风险的防范。
"Mr. Xi still seems to hope to restart talks with Washington to manage tensions. But his unusually blunt warning against U.S. intentions will also ripple through the Chinese political system, saidRyan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was director for China at the National Security Council under President Obama.",习近平似乎仍希望重启与华盛顿关于管控紧张局势的谈判。但曾在奥巴马政府担任国家安全委员会中国事务主任的布鲁金斯学会高级研究员何瑞恩(Ryan Hass)表示，习近平对美国的意图发出异常直白的警告，也会在中国的政治体系中制造波澜。
"""President Xi's public expression of frustration toward Washington will give license to other actors in China's system to take a sharper public line against the United States,"" Mr. Hass said in an email. ""I expect President Biden and Xi to speak again in the coming couple of months,"" he added. ""Until the relationship finds areas of common purpose, though, it will remain defined by mutual enmity and grievance.""","""习主席公开表达对华盛顿的不满，等于是允许中国体制内的其他人对美采取更尖锐的公开立场，""何瑞恩在电子邮件中表示。""我预计拜登总统和习近平将在未来几个月内再次通话，""他补充道。""不过，在找到共同利益点之前，两国关系仍会以相互敌对和不满为主。"""
"The congress in Beijing has been stage-managed to show support for Mr. Xi's domestic and foreign policies. The 2,952 congress delegates selected for their loyalty to the party stood to applaud Mr. Xi after they had all voted to keep him as president. As the voting progressed, Mr. Xi sat on the podium chatting at length with his No. 2, the incoming Chinese premier, Li Qiang, who is expected to focus on growth.",北京召开的大会经过了精心安排，目的在于展示对习近平国内外政策的支持。2952名因对党忠诚而被选出的人大代表全票支持习近平继续担任国家主席，随后为他起立鼓掌。投票进行之时，端坐台上的习近平与他的二号人物——即将上任的中国总理李强——交谈良久，预计李强的工作目标是专注于经济增长。
"Mr. Xi opened the way for his third term as president by engineering a constitutional change in 2018 that abolished what had been a two-term limit on that office.On that occasion, three legislative delegates abstained, while two dared vote against the change.",习近平在2018年推动修宪，废除了国家主席的两届任期限制，为自己的第三个任期铺平道路。那次会议上有三名人大代表弃权，还有两人勇敢地反对修宪。
"Economic growth slowed to3 percent last year, lower than expected, as businesses and supply chains bore the brunt of Covid lockdowns and mass quarantines across the country. Unemployment among urban youth rose to nearly 20 percent in the worst months of 2022.",去年，由于企业和供应链受到全国各地新冠封锁和大规模隔离措施的冲击，中国经济增速放缓至3%，低于预期。在2022年形势最糟糕的几个月里，城市年轻人的失业率升至近20%。
"""I'm optimistic that as soon as the National People's Congress is over, and Li Qiang has fully taken over, then China is going to roll out measures to boost the confidence of the private sector,"" said Wang Xiangwei, a former chief editor of The South China Morning Post, a newspaper in Hong Kong.","""我乐观地认为，一旦全国人大结束，李强全面掌权，中国就会推出提振民营部门信心的措施，""香港《南华早报》前总编辑王向伟说。"
"""If you want to revive the Chinese economy, you have to rely on the private sector,"" Mr. Wang, who now writes anewsletter on Chinese politics, said in an interview. ""However, the private sector has been hit so hard that mere words to soothe their concerns is not enough.""","""要想重振中国经济，就必须依靠民营部门，""王向伟在接受采访时说。他目前在编撰一个有关中国政治的时事通讯。""然而，民营部门受到这样严重的打击，仅仅用言语来安抚他们的担忧是不够的。"""
"Mr. Xi and his top lieutenants have not yet offered specific responses to the deep unease in China's private business community about the increasingly intrusive role of the government and restrictions on private investment. Beijing has been requiring companies to transfer a small stake and a seat on the board to the government and ordering companies to consult with Communist Party cells installed in their firms. Even as China tries to restore investor confidence, many of those policies may stay.",对于政府越来越多的干预，以及对私人投资的限制，中国民营企业界深感不安，而习近平和他的高级副手们还没有对此作出具体回应。北京一直在要求企业将小部分股份和董事会席位转让给政府，并要求企业与内部的党支部进行磋商。尽管中国试图恢复投资者信心，但许多这样的政策可能会保留。
"""Because they're now facing what they take to be an insecure environment at home and abroad, they're really taking steps to concentrate power, not to let go of it,"" Kou Chien-Wen, a professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei who specializes in Chinese politics, said of China's leaders.","""因为在他们看来，现在面临着不安全的国内外环境，所以他们确实在采取措施集中权力，而不是放开权力，""位于台北的国立政治大学专门研究中国政治的寇健文教授在谈到中国领导人时说。"
"State media reports of Mr. Xi's meetings with businesspeople during the annual legislative session sought to emphasize the party's expectation that entrepreneurs serve its party's priorities, in return for its support. The reports highlighted a rural entrepreneur who was quoted as saying that companies should invest in farming. They also featured Robin Zeng, the founder of CATL, a topmaker of batteriesfor electric cars that has given China a commanding lead in a core technology. China views achieving independence in electric cars and other major industries of the future as a top priority.",官媒对习近平在两会期间会见工商界人士的报道旨在强调党的期望，即企业家要为党的优先事项服务，以换取党的支持。这些报道聚焦了一位农村企业家的发言，称企业应对农业进行投资。宁德时代创始人曾毓群也是主角之一，这家行业领先的电动汽车电池制造商让中国在一项核心技术上占据了绝对主导地位。中国将实现电动汽车和未来其他主要产业的独立视为重中之重。
"In the meeting with Mr. Xi, the reports said, Mr. Zeng discussed China's dependence on foreign countries for strategic minerals. He said China should do more to ensure access to such ""upstream"" resources that supply manufacturers with the raw materials. Again, Mr. Xi used the chance to warn of threats to China's security.","报道称，在与习近平会面时，曾毓群讨论了中国在战略性矿产资源上对外国的依赖。他说，中国应加强""上游""矿产资源保障，以便为制造商供应原料。习近平则再次利用这个机会对中国面临的安全威胁发出警告。"
"""Some of those who want to choke our throats really do want to start from upstream,"" Mr. Xi replied, according to theofficial account of the meeting. ""When they're playing a zero-sum game with us, we need to leave ourselves a way out.""","""人家对我们'卡脖子'有些恰恰就是从上游开始的，""据此次会谈的官方报道，习近平这样回应道。""在人家对我们零和博弈情况下，还要给自己留条后路啊!"""
"As he heads into an expected third term as president, China's top leader, Xi Jinping, is signaling that he will take a harder stance against what he perceives as an effort by the United States to block China's rise. And he's doing so in uncommonly blunt terms.",随着中国最高领导人习近平步入预料之中的第三个国家主席任期，他正在发出信号，表示将采取更强硬的立场，反对被他视为美国阻止中国崛起的努力。而且，他的措辞少见地直截了当。
"Mr. Xi has hailed China's success as proof that modernization does not equal Westernization. He has urged China to strive to develop advanced technologies to reduce its reliance on Western know-how. Then on Monday, he made clear what he regarded as an important threat to China's growth: the United States.",习近平称赞中国的成功表明了现代化不等于西方化。他要求中国努力发展先进技术，减少对西方技术的依赖。然后在周一，他明确指出了在他看来中国发展壮大面临的一个重大威胁:美国。
"""Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-around containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country's development,"" Mr. Xi said in a speech, according to China's official news agency.","""以美国为首的西方国家对我实施了全方位的遏制、围堵、打压，给我国发展带来前所未有的严峻挑战，""据中国官方通讯社报道，习近平在一个讲话中这样说道。"
"In an indication that Mr. Xi's forthright approach signaled a broader shift in Beijing's rhetoric, China's new foreign minister on Tuesday reinforced Mr. Xi's message about containment.",习近平直截了当的说法意味着中国政府使用的语言发生了广泛的变化，作为这种变化的标志，中国新任外交部长在周二强调了习近平有关遏制的信息。
Mr. Xi's new directness could play well at home with a nationalist audience but risks raising wariness abroad at a time when Beijing has sought to stabilize ties with the West. It reflects how he is bracing for more confrontation and competition between the world's two largest economies.,习近平新的直截说法也许是国内民族主义听众喜闻乐见的，但在中国政府寻求与西方保持稳定关系之际，这可能会引起国外的警惕。从这个说法当中可以看到，他正在为世界上两个最大经济体之间更多的对抗和竞争做准备。
"His meeting with President Biden in November had raised hopes that Beijing and Washington might try to arrest the downward spiral in relations. Tensions have since only escalated over American support of Taiwan, the democratically governed island Beijing claims as its territory, as well as U.S. accusations that China operates a fleet of spy balloons, a claim China has denied.",习近平去年11月与拜登总统的会晤曾让人们对北京和华盛顿可能会寻求阻止两国关系螺旋式下降抱有希望。但围绕美国支持民主自治的台湾(北京坚称对其拥有主权)，以及指责中国拥有一支间谍气球舰队(该国否认了这个说法)，双方的紧张关系在那次会晤之后只是进一步升级。
"The Biden administration has depicted Mr. Xi as seeking to reshape the United States-led international order to bolster Beijing's interests. China's close alignment with Russia, at a time when the West is seeking to isolate Moscow over its war on Ukraine, has intensified concerns about a new type of cold war.",拜登政府指出，为了维护北京的利益，习近平寻求重塑美国主导的国际秩序。在西方由于乌克兰战争寻求孤立莫斯科的时候，中俄紧密结盟加剧了人们对一种新型冷战的担忧。
"""This is the first time to my knowledge that Xi Jinping has publicly come out and identified the U.S. as taking such actions against China,"" said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. ""It is, without doubt, a response to the harsh criticisms of China, and of Xi Jinping personally, that Biden and many in the administration have leveled in recent months.""","""据我所知，这是习近平第一次公开说出是美国在对中国采取遏制措施，""昆西治国方略研究所高级研究员史文(Michael Swaine)说。""毫无疑问，这是在回应拜登和美国政府里的许多人最近几个月对中国以及习近平本人的严厉批评。"""
"China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, the former ambassador to the United States, defended Beijing's right to respond.",曾任中国驻美国大使的外交部长秦刚为北京有权做出回应进行了辩护。
"""The United States actually wants China not to fight back when hit or cursed, but this is impossible,"" he said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday.","美国""实际上就是要中国打不还手，骂不还口，但这办不到""，他周二在北京的记者会上说。"
"Mr. Qin also called for the United States to take a less confrontational stance toward his country. ""If the U.S. doesn't step on the brakes but continues to speed up, no guardrail can stop the derailment,"" he said.","秦刚还呼吁美国不要对中国采取如此对抗的立场。""如果美方不踩刹车，继续沿着错误道路狂飙下去，再多的护栏也挡不住脱轨翻车，""他说。"
"China has come under increasing pressure from the United States and its allies to use its influence on Russia to stop the Ukraine war. Washington has also publicly accused China of considering sending weapons to Russia for its war, prompting a flurry of warnings from Western officials that Beijing would face consequences for such an action.",中国已受到来自美国及其盟友越来越大的压力，要求该国利用对俄罗斯的影响力来帮助停止乌克兰战争。华盛顿还公开指责中国，称其正在考虑向俄罗斯提供用于这场战争的武器。这个指责已引发了西方官员的一连串警告，他们表示，如果北京那样做的话，就要承担后果。
"Mr. Qin, the foreign minister, denied the weapons allegations and criticized U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan. He blamed an ""invisible hand"" the United States, in other words for escalating the conflict in Ukraine.","外交部长秦刚否认了美国有关武器的指责，并批评美国向台湾出售军火。他说，""似乎有只'看不见的手'""——换句话说是美国——在推动乌克兰冲突升级。"
"China ""is not a party to the crisis and has not provided weapons to either side of the conflict,"" Mr. Qin said. ""So on what basis is this talk of blame, sanctions and threats against China? This is absolutely unacceptable.""","中国""不是危机的当事方，也没有向冲突的任何一方提供武器，""秦刚说。""凭什么向中国甩锅推责，甚至制裁、威胁?我们绝不接受!"""
"Asked for the Biden administration's response to Mr. Xi's criticism of the United States, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said, ""We seek a strategic competition with China, we do not seek conflict.""","当被问及拜登政府对习近平批评美国的回应时，国家安全委员会发言人约翰·柯比表示，""我们寻求与中国的战略竞争，我们不寻求冲突。"""
"""There is nothing about our approach to this most consequential of bilateral relationships that should lead anybody to think we want conflict,"" Mr. Kirby added, reiterating that the administration still does not support independence for Taiwan.","""我们在这个最重要的双边关系上的做法没有一点应该让任何人以为我们想要冲突，""柯比补充道，并重申政府仍然不支持台湾独立。"
"China's ambitions have also fueled pressure and scrutiny from the United States on trade and technology. As China has built the world's largest navy and asserted its claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea, a bipartisan consensus has formed in Washington in favor of reducing American dependence on manufactured goods from China and restricting Beijing's access to advanced technologies that could be used in war.",中国的野心还加剧了美国在贸易和技术方面施加的压力和审查。随着中国建立世界上最大的海军、宣称对台湾和南中国海拥有主权，美国的两党已形成共识，赞成减少美国对中国制成品的依赖，限制中国政府获得可用于战争的先进技术。
The tariffs that Donald J. Trump imposed on a wide range of Chinese exports to the United States are still mostly in place. President Biden has also imposed broad curbs on the export to China of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Biden administration and Congress have increased their scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States and begun looking at limits on American investments in China's tech sector.,特朗普任总统时曾对中国向美国输出的大量商品征收关税，其中大部分目前仍然保留。拜登总统也对出口到中国的半导体和半导体制造设备采取了广泛的限制措施。拜登政府和国会还加强了对中国在美投资的审查，并开始考虑限制美国对中国科技行业的投资。
"These restrictions come as the Communist Party has sought to focus its efforts on reviving the economy, which grew only 3 percent last year, falling far short of the government's target. The Chinese government's ""zero Covid"" policy of citywide lockdowns, mass testing and quarantines forced many businesses to shutter, disrupted industrial supply chains and severely damaged consumer confidence, especially last year.","这些限制措施是在中共正试图集中精力振兴经济的时候出台的，中国去年的经济增长率只有3%，远低于政府目标。中国政府实施的新冠""清零""政策曾让整座城市遭到封控，全民核酸，集中隔离，迫使许多企业倒闭，扰乱了工业供应链，严重损害了消费者信心，这些情况去年尤其严重。"
"Mr. Xi pointed to the United States' restrictions as holding back growth, but Washington's trade measures had little immediate effect on overall trade.",虽然习近平认为是美国的限制措施阻碍了中国的经济增长，但华盛顿的贸易限制措施对整体贸易几乎没有立竿见影的效果。
His comments about the United States were part of a speech he made to a Chinese business group. He urged private companies a main driver of growth and jobs to work with the party to help China counter the challenges posed by U.S. containment.,习近平有关美国的说法出现在他对一个中国商业团体发表的讲话中。他要求民营企业与中共一起，帮助中国应对美国遏制措施带来的挑战。民营企业曾是中国经济增长和就业的主要驱动力。
"""We must remain calm, maintain concentration, seek progress while maintaining stability, take active actions, unite as one, and dare to fight,"" he said, according to the report by Chinese television.","""必须做到沉着冷静、保持定力，稳中求进、积极作为，团结一致、敢于斗争，""据中国的电视台报道，他在讲话中说道。"
Mr. Xi has held China up as a model for other countries one that offers a different path to prosperity than the West's. This worldview rejects liberal democracy and a heavy reliance on the private sector and favors a model that emphasizes the centrality of the Communist Party and an increasingly state-led model of economic development.,习近平把中国树立为其他国家的榜样，称中国展示了一条不同于西方的发展道路。这种世界观拒绝自由民主制度和过多地依赖民营部门，而是更多地强调中共的核心地位和越来越多地由国家主导的经济发展模式。
But his speech on Monday was broadly aimed at reassuring the audience that the Chinese government still wants private businesses to play a large role in the country's economy. The recent disappearance into government custody of a top banker for the tech sector has unnerved many tech executives. The state-owned banking system has also been steering much of its lending to state-owned enterprises instead of private businesses.,但他周一的讲话更多地是为了让听他讲话的人相信，中国政府仍希望民营企业在国家经济中发挥重要作用。最近，科技行业所熟知的一名银行家被当局传唤后失踪一事让许多科技行业的高管们感到不安。国有的银行系统也一直将大部分贷款引导到国有企业而非民营企业。
"Mr. Xi sought to assure private companies that the party embraced them as ""one of us."" At the same time, he said they had a responsibility to assist the party in achieving ""common prosperity,"" a slogan about reducing income inequality that has been linked to crackdowns on tycoons.","习近平极力向民营企业家保证，中共视他们为""自己人""。他同时还说，民营企业有责任帮助中共实现""共同富裕""，人们将他的这个减少收入不平等的口号与打击大亨联系起来。"
"China's propaganda apparatus appeared to be directing Mr. Xi's accusations about the United States at the Chinese public, placing it on the front page of People's Daily on Tuesday while omitting it entirely from an English-language version of the same article from the official Xinhua news agency.",中国宣传机器对习近平指责美国的报道似乎是以中国公众为目标。《人民日报》周二把这篇报道放在了头版，而官方通讯社新华社在英文版的报道中则省略了这部分内容。
"Andrew K. Collier, the managing director of Hong Kong-based Orient Capital Research, said that Mr. Xi may not have been trying to adjust his stance toward the United States as much as reassure the Chinese public that he is defending their interests.",总部设在香港的东方资本研究公司董事总经理安德鲁·科利尔称，习近平也许并不是在尝试调整他对美国的立场，而更多地是让中国公众相信，他在捍卫他们的利益。
"""Xi Jinping's comment about containment may heighten tensions with the United States, but he is mainly speaking to a domestic audience,"" Mr. Collier said. ""He's trying to foster the country's high-tech firms both for economic growth and to handle decoupling at a time when China is facing severe economic headwinds. Beating the nationalist drum is a politically savvy way to achieve these goals.""","""虽然习近平有关美国遏制中国的说法也许会加剧与美国的紧张关系，但他的讲话主要是针对国内听众的，""科利尔说。""他是在中国面临严重经济逆风的时候，为促进经济增长和应对脱钩努力扶植本国的高技术企业。竭力鼓吹民族主义在政治上是实现这些目标的精明做法。"""
"Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, offered a more pessimistic assessment of the Chinese leader's stance.",新加坡南洋理工大学拉惹勒南国际研究院副教授李明江对中国领导人的立场则持有更为悲观的看法。
"""Xi's comments suggest that the Chinese leadership believes the U.S. and the West do not have any good intentions towards China,"" he said. ""It clearly indicates that they understand that China's relations with the Western world will be very difficult in the coming years.""","""习近平的言论表明，中国领导层认为美国和西方对中国毫无善意，""他说。""这清楚地表明，他们明白中国与西方世界的关系在未来几年将陷入困境。"""
"NEW DELHI When the top diplomats of four major Asia-Pacific nations met here in the Indian capital on Friday to discuss issues in the region, one had a direct message for the behemoth whose shadow loomed over the talk.",新德里——上周五，亚太地区四个主要国家的高级外交官在印度首都会面讨论地区问题时，有一个人对笼罩着会谈的那个庞然大物发出了直接喊话。
"China must ""act under the international institutions, standards and laws"" to avoid conflict, Yoshimasa Hayashi, the foreign minister of Japan, said on a public panel that included his counterparts from the United States, India and Australia.","在一个包括美国、印度和澳大利亚外长在内的公开座谈上，日本外相林芳正表示，中国必须""在国际机构、标准和法律的约束下行动""，以避免冲突。"
"That request is one that every official on that stage has made on many occasions. Although Russia's war in Ukraine has dominated diplomatic dialogue around the globe this past year, the dilemma of dealing with an increasingly assertive China is ever-present and for many nations, a thornier problem than relations with Moscow. They subscribe to the framing that President Biden and his aides have presented: China is the greatest long-term challenge, and the one nation with the power and resources to reshape the American-led order to its advantage.",当时在台上的每一位官员都在多个场合提出过这一要求。尽管俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争是过去一年全球外交对话的主要内容，但如何应对日益强硬的中国的难题始终存在——对许多国家来说，这比同莫斯科之间的关系更加棘手。他们认同拜登总统及其助手提出的框架:中国是最大的长期挑战，也有能力和资源重塑美国主导的秩序，使其对中国有利。
"At the heart of this predicament is the fact that the United States and its allies maintain deep trade ties with China even as their security concerns and ideological friction with the nation's leader, Xi Jinping, and the Chinese Communist Party escalate.",这一困境的核心是，美国及其盟友与中国保持着深厚的贸易关系，即使他们的安全关切以及与中国领导人习近平和中国共产党的意识形态摩擦不断升级。
"For President Biden and his aides, that tension came into sharp focus in recent weeks after a Chinese spy balloon began drifting over the continental United States, and when, in their telling, they came across intelligence that China is considering sending weapons to Russia for its war. That prospect has prompted American diplomats and those from allies and partners to deliver warnings to Chinese counterparts, including here in New Delhi.",对拜登总统和他的助手而言，最近几周双方的紧张关系变得非常突出——一个中国间谍气球在美国大陆上空飘浮;他们还得到情报称中国正在考虑为俄罗斯的战争输送武器。这一前景促使美国及其盟友和伙伴的外交官向中国外交官发出警告，包括在新德里发表的言论。
"The anxieties over both China's and Russia's increasingly discordant roles on the world stage were perhaps wrapped into a lament on Thursday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that ""multilateralism is in crisis today.""","上周四，印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪感叹，""当今的多边主义面临危机。""这或许可以反映对中俄在世界舞台上日益不协调的角色的担忧。"
"""Global governance has failed in both its mandates"" of preventing wars and fostering international cooperation, he said in a video address to a conference of top diplomats from the Group of 20 nations, made up of the world's major economies, including China and Russia.","他在对二十国集团高级外交官会议的视频讲话中说，""全球治理在防止战争和促进国际合作这两个任务上都失败了""。二十国集团由包括中国和俄罗斯在内的世界主要经济体组成。"
"The four Asia-Pacific countries represented on the panel one day later at the Raisina Dialogue form the Quad partnership, which was revived in 2017 after many years of dormancy and has gained momentum since, mainly because of shared strategic concerns over China. But in a sign of the delicate balance they are trying to strike in relations with Beijing, the diplomats took pains to stress in their public comments that the Quad is not a security or military organization. Mr. Hayashi was the sole panelist to mention China, and only after being prompted by the panel's moderator.","在于次日进行的上述座谈会上，与会的四个亚太国家曾经通过""瑞辛纳对话""形成""四方安全对话""机制，在沉寂多年后，该伙伴关系于2017年重启，此后势头强劲，主要是因为对中国的共同战略关切。但这些外交官在公开评论中煞费苦心地强调，该机制不是一个安全或军事组织，这表明他们正试图在与北京的关系中保持微妙的平衡。林芳正是唯一一位提到中国的嘉宾，而且是在主持人的提示下才提到的。"
"Their joint statement, released after private meetings, did not mention China, although many points in it, including the issue of ""peace and security in the maritime domain,"" are obviously aimed at Chinese policies.","他们在非公开会议后发表的联合声明中没有提到中国，尽管其中包括""海洋领域的和平与安全""问题在内的许多观点，显然是针对中国的政策。"
"At the earlier Group of 20 conference, the foreign minister of China, Qin Gang, joined the foreign minister of Russia, Sergey V. Lavrov, in playing the role of spoiler.",在早些时候的二十国集团会议上，中国外长秦刚和俄罗斯外长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫一起扮演了搅局者的角色。
"Together, they opposed two paragraphs in a proposed consensus communique, the first of which directly criticized Russia's war in Ukraine. Even though the leaders of the Group of 20 had approved the same two paragraphs in a consensus document at a meeting last year in Bali, Indonesia, China has dug in with Russia to sabotage both this week's communique and a similar one proposed at a G20 finance ministers' conference in late February in Bengaluru, India.",他们共同反对拟议的共识公报中的两个段落，其中第一段直接批评了俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争。尽管二十国集团领导人去年在印度尼西亚巴厘岛的一次会议上通过了一份共识文件中的同样两段内容，但中国与俄罗斯联手破坏了公报，以及二月底在印度班加罗尔举行的二十国集团财长会议上提出的一份类似文件。
"The second paragraph in the communique that they objected to did not mention Russia or Ukraine. It simply said that all the nations agreed to uphold United Nations principles on international humanitarian law, ""including the protection of civilians and infrastructure in armed conflicts"" and forbidding ""the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.""","他们反对的公报文件的第二段没有提到俄罗斯或乌克兰，只是表示所有国家都同意维护联合国关于国际人道主义法的原则，""包括在武装冲突中保护平民和基础设施""，以及禁止""使用或威胁使用核武器""。"
"Some diplomats privately expressed surprise that China opposed a reiteration of such basic principles, a move that forced the conference to issue a lower-level chair's statement. Mr. Qin's stance seemed to validate concerns that his government was willing to side with Russia in a growing number of diplomatic venues including at the United Nations Security Council to undermine policies or actions that the vast majority of nations endorse.",一些外交官私下里对中国反对重申这些基本原则表示惊讶，此举迫使会议发表了一份级别较低的主席声明。秦刚的立场似乎证实了人们的担忧，即中国政府愿意在越来越多的外交场合站在俄罗斯一边，破坏绝大多数国家支持的政策或行动——包括在联合国安理会。
"""Russia and China were the only two countries that made clear that they would not sign on to that text,"" Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said pointedly at a news conference on Thursday night. He added that he agreed with Mr. Modi ""that there are real challenges to the multilateral system.""","""俄罗斯和中国是仅有的两个明确表示不会签署该文本的国家，""美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯在上周四晚上的新闻发布会上尖锐地说。他还表示，他同意莫迪的观点，""多边体系面临着真正的挑战""。"
"He noted, too, that at the U.N. Security Council, ""we have two countries in particular that tend to block the attempted actions of the council to address some of the most urgent global concerns.""","他还指出，在联合国安理会，""有两个国家尤其倾向于阻止安理会采取行动，解决一些最紧迫的全球关切问题。"""
"Mr. Blinken has also expressed skepticism over a push by Beijing for peace negotiations in the war in Ukraine, saying Chinese officials are merely creating a smoke screen to buy Russia more time to press its assault.",布林肯还对北京推动就乌克兰战争进行和平谈判的努力表示怀疑，称中国官员只是在制造烟雾，为俄罗斯争取更多时间发动进攻。
"Chinese officials say they will happily cooperate with countries in the international system, and that it is the United States fanning the flames of division with its ""Cold War mentality.""","中国官员表示，他们愿意在国际体系中与其他国家合作，是美国用其""冷战思维""煽动分裂的火焰。"
"China is ready to work with other Group of 20 nations to both ""stay committed to solidarity and cooperation"" and ""play a bigger role in addressing major global economic and financial challenges,"" said Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday as the meetings in New Delhi began.","上周四在新德里的会议开始时，中国外交部发言人毛宁在北京举行的新闻发布会上表示，中国愿与二十国集团的其他国家一道，""坚持团结合作的精神……在应对全球经济金融重大挑战，推动世界经济稳定复苏和全球发展方面发挥更大作用。"""
"After Mr. Blinken's critical remarks, Ms. Mao said Friday that Mr. Qin had urged the Group of 20 nations to engage in ""real multilateralism"" and avoid ""power politics and camps of confrontation."" She added that the G20 was an inappropriate venue for discussing Ukraine, and criticized the Quad partnership as a ""closed small circle.""","在布林肯发表批评言论后，毛宁于上周五表示，秦刚敦促二十国集团践行""真正的多边主义""，避免""强权政治、甚至阵营对抗""。她还说，二十国集团会议不是讨论乌克兰问题的合适场合，并批评四边机制是一个""排他封闭的'小圈子'""。"
"Ms. Mao also lashed out at an announcement by the U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday that it was restricting trade with 28 Chinese entities that American officials accused of violating U.S. sanctions, including certain bans on nuclear and missile technology sales. That move, Ms. Mao said, showed the United States was going to great lengths to ""suppress Chinese enterprises.""","毛宁还抨击了美国商务部上周四宣布限制与28家中国实体进行贸易的声明，美国官员指责这些实体违反了美国的制裁措施，包括对核技术和导弹技术销售的某些禁令。毛宁说，此举表明美国正在竭尽全力""打压中国企业""。"
"The Biden administration has broadened an effort begun by the Trump administration to hobble Chinese companies that the U.S. government views as potential national security threats, including Huawei, China's most important communications technology company. Last October, Mr. Biden announced sweeping restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, in what aides called an effort to end China's access to ""foundational technologies.""","拜登政府扩大了一些始于特朗普政府的行动，以限制美国政府视为潜在国家安全威胁的中国公司，包括中国最重要的通信技术公司华为。去年10月，拜登宣布全面限制向中国出售先进半导体和半导体制造设备，助手们称此举是为了阻止中国获得""基础技术""。"
"The Biden administration is pushing two allies, Japan and the Netherlands, to also impose further limits on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. That subject might have come up when Mr. Blinken met in New Delhi with his Dutch and Japanese counterparts. The move is another manifestation of the Biden administration's belief that China can be constrained only by getting allies and partners on the same page.",拜登政府正在推动日本和荷兰这两个盟国也进一步限制向中国销售半导体制造设备。布林肯在新德里会见荷兰和日本外长时可能会提到这个话题。此举再次表明，拜登政府相信，只有让盟友和伙伴站在同一立场上，才能遏制中国。
"And Mr. Blinken warned China on Thursday night of economic penalties if it went ahead with giving weapons to Russia: ""We have sanctions authorities of various kinds,"" he said.","布林肯上周四晚上警告中国，一旦向俄罗斯提供武器，中国将受到经济惩罚:""我们有各种各样的制裁权力，""他说。"
"For world leaders, those irrepressible tensions are more evidence that the international system is cleaving into blocs, and that Mr. Modi's urgent plea to diplomats this week was falling on deaf ears: ""Focus not on what divides us, but on what unites us.""","对世界领导人来说，这些无法抑制的紧张局势进一步证明，国际体系正在分裂成多个集团，而莫迪向外交官发出的紧急呼吁却无人理睬:""不要关注让我们分裂的东西，而要关注把我们团结在一起的东西。"""
"China's leaders are set to use a gathering of the top legislature starting Sunday to outline plans to restore public confidence and bolster economic growth after a year of uncertainty, disruption and discontent around the government's Covid restrictions.",中国领导人将利用周日开始的最高立法机关会议概述恢复公众信心、促进经济增长的计划，此前一年，围绕政府的疫情防控措施一直存在着不确定性、混乱和不满。
"The annual session of the largely ceremonial National People's Congress in Beijing is aimed at conveying the ruling Communist Party's confidence and inspiring national unity. For the country's top leader, Xi Jinping, this year's event will also be key to reinforcing his authority after his signature ""zero Covid"" policy, now abandoned, drew widespread protests in November and worsened an economic slowdown.","在北京召开的一年一度的全国人民代表大会基本上是仪式性的，旨在传达执政的共产党的信心，并激励举国上下团结一致。对于中国最高领导人习近平来说，在他标志性的""清零""政策(现已放弃)11月引发了广泛抗议并加剧经济放缓后，今年的人大会议也将是强化其权威的关键。"
"The leadership will lay out its agenda for addressing challenges such as mounting local government debt, unemployment, a housing slump, weak exports and a shrinking population. Delegates are expected to rubber-stamp decisions made in advance, behind closed doors, by leaders of the party who hold ultimate authority.","领导层将提出施政计划以应对挑战，例如日益增长的地方债、失业、房市低迷、出口疲软和人口萎缩。预计人大代表将会""走过场""，批准持有最终权力的领导人事先闭门做出的决定。"
"At the end of the gathering, which runs for nine days, Mr. Xi is all but assured to be appointed to another five-year term as president after securing a groundbreaking third term as party leader in October. He is also expected to appoint his loyalists and allies to key government positions.",习近平在去年10月突破性地确立了他的第三个党总书记任期，在九天的人大会议结束时，几乎可以肯定他将再次连任五年国家主席。预计他还会任命忠实的追随者和盟友担任重要的政府职位。
Here's what to expect from the legislative gathering.,以下是我们对此次大会的预测。
The party will probably defend its handling of Covid.,中共将捍卫其新冠应对方式。
"The gathering will be the first since China abruptly lifted ""zero Covid,"" a deeply unpopular policy of lockdowns and quarantines.","这是中国突然取消""清零""政策后的第一次人大会议，该政策使用封锁和隔离措施，非常不得人心。"
"In the lead-up to the congress, China's propaganda apparatus has pushed a triumphant narrative declaring that under Mr. Xi's leadership, the party's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic was a ""miracle in human history"" and ""completely correct."" It has emphasized the importance of unity behind the party's leaders.","在大会召开之前，中国的宣传机构推动了一种胜利说，宣称在习近平的领导下，该党对新冠大流行的应对是""人类文明史上的奇迹""，且""完全正确""。它强调团结在党领导人身后的重要性。"
"""As long as the party and the people always stand together, think together, and work together, no storm can shake our steel will, and no difficulty can stop our resolute steps,"" the People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, said on Friday.","党报《人民日报》周五写道:""只要党和人民始终站在一起、想在一起、干在一起，任何风浪都动摇不了我们的钢铁意志，任何困难都阻挡不了我们的铿锵步伐。"""
"Security around the city will be heavy, and traffic will probably be congested as roughly 3,000 delegates from around the country handpicked by the party descend on the capital and convene at the cavernous Great Hall of the People.",随着中共从全国各地精心挑选的大约3000名代表抵达首都，在宏伟的人民大会堂举行会议，北京各处将戒备森严，交通可能会出现拥堵。
"In recent years, delegates had to take Covid tests and wear masks during gatherings. It is unclear how many such restrictions will remain. Despite the nationwide lifting of most Covid limits, foreign journalists invited to cover the congress were told that they had to quarantine overnight to attend some news conferences.",近年来，代表们在大会召开期间必须接受新冠病毒检测并佩戴口罩。目前尚不清楚还会有多少这样的限制。尽管在全国范围内取消了大多数新冠限制措施，但受邀报道大会的外国记者被告知，他们必须隔离一晚才能参加一些新闻发布会。
China will show that it once again cares about growth,中国将再次表现出对增长的关心
"When the meeting opens, the departing premier, Li Keqiang, will deliver a government work report that is expected to include a target of roughly 5 percent in economic growth for the year.",会议开幕时，即将离任的总理李克强将发表一份政府工作报告，预计将包括今年经济增长约5%的目标。
"China's economy had its weakest performance in decades last year, dragged down by lockdowns and then widespread Covid outbreaks in December. Businesses have been rattled in recent years by crackdowns on Big Tech and other sectors, and developers ran out of money as regulators reined inexcessive debt.",受封锁和12月大范围暴发的新冠疫情拖累，去年中国经济出现了几十年来最差的表现。近年来，由于政府对大型科技公司和其他行业的打击，企业深感不安;随着监管机构控制过度举债，房地产开发商资金枯竭。
"In recent weeks, local officials confronted protesters in multiple cities after some municipalities cut health insurance to alleviate a debt crisis. Youth unemployment is high, and the birthrate is at a record low. In January, the country announced its first population decline in six decades.",最近几周，一些城市为缓解债务危机将医保缩水后，出现了警民对峙。年轻人失业率居高不下，出生率创历史新低。今年1月，中国宣布60年来人口首次呈现负增长。
"To juice economic growth, a major pillar of the party's legitimacy, the party is expected to pledge to boost middle-class spending, restore confidence to investors and create new jobs.",为了推动经济增长——这是中共合法性的主要支柱——预计该党将承诺刺激中产阶级消费，恢复投资者信心并创造新的就业机会。
"In a sign of concerns about the fragility of the economy, Chinese officials have adopted business-friendlylanguagethat marks a shift from its emphasis on developing amore state-controlled economy. China analysts will be watching for how the work report balances Mr. Xi's statist direction with pro-growth rhetoric.",出于对经济脆弱性的担忧，中国官员采用了对企业友好的措辞，标志着不再强调发展更多受国家控制的经济。中国分析人士将关注工作报告如何平衡习近平的国家主义方向与支持增长的言论。
China is bracing for a world more wary of Beijing's ambitions,中国正准备迎接一个对其野心更加警惕的世界
"The premier's report will probably reflect Mr. Xi's long-term vision of China's leading role in a more multipolar world, replacing the United States-led international order. Mr. Xi has declared that China's success proved that modernization did not equal Westernization.",总理的报告可能反映出习近平让中国在更加多极化的世界中发挥领导作用的长期愿景，以取代美国主导的国际秩序。习近平宣称，中国的成功证明了现代化不等于西方化。
"For Mr. Xi, this entails reducing the country's reliance on the West for key technologies, building a world-class military, increasing the party's control over the security apparatus, steering the economy and curbing financial risks.",对习近平来说，这需要减少中国在关键技术上对西方的依赖，建立世界一流的军队，加强党对安全机构的控制，引导经济，并遏制金融风险。
"China is facing scrutiny over allegations by the United States that it is considering providing arms and ammunitionto Russia in its war in Ukraine. The United States has imposed sweeping limits on semiconductor exports to China. Many economies are bracing for recession, which will further dampen demand for Chinese exports.",由于美国指控中国正在考虑向俄罗斯提供武器弹药用于乌克兰战争，它正面临着外界的密切关注。美国全面限制了对中国的半导体出口。许多经济体正在为衰退做准备，这将进一步抑制对中国出口产品的需求。
"As the dispute over a Chinese spy balloon last month demonstrated, relations with the United States are more volatile than ever, especially as China takes a more confrontational stance on Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory. Observers will watch the congress for any legislation or subtle signs of shifts in Taiwan policy.",正如上个月关于中国间谍气球的争端所表明的那样，中美关系比以往任何时候都更加不稳定，尤其是在中国对台湾采取更具对抗性的立场之际，北京声称这个自治的岛屿是其领土。观察人士将密切关注这次大会，寻找任何立法或对台政策变化的细微迹象。
Xi's allies are expected to take top jobs in government reshuffle,习近平的盟友有望在政府改组中担任高级职务
"The National People's Congress also finalizes personnel decisions for the premier, vice premiers, state councilors and dozens of ministry-level departments. Some of these were set at a previous party congress, and others have been decided in closed-door sessions ahead of the event.",大会还将决定总理、副总理、国务委员和几十个部级部门的人事任命。其中一些是在之前的党代会上制定的，还有一些是在本次大会之前的闭门会议上决定的。
"Mr. Xi's close ally, Li Qiang, currently No. 2 in the party's top body, the Politburo Standing Committee, is set to take over as premier. As is customary for the premier, the incoming Mr. Li will hold a news conference at the end of the congress, in which reporters' questions are usually vetted beforehand.",习近平的亲密盟友、目前在党的最高机构政治局常委中排名第二的李强将接任总理一职。按照惯例，即将上任的李强将在大会结束时举行新闻发布会，记者的提问通常经过提前审核。
"Analysts are also looking out for other appointments to the leadership of China's economy and financial sectors. They include Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to be executive vice premier. He Lifeng, another close ally to Mr. Xi and head of China's powerful economic policy planning body, is expected to become vice premier; and Zhu Hexin, a veteran banker, might be tapped to run China's central bank.",分析人士还在关注中国经济和金融部门领导层的其他任命。其中，丁薛祥有望出任常务副总理。习近平的另一位亲密盟友、中国强大的经济政策规划机构负责人何立峰有望成为副总理;资深银行家朱鹤新可能会被任命为中国央行的负责人。
"""They are all people who really are party people, first and foremost, and, of course, close associates of Xi Jinping,"" said Tony Saich, a China specialist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. ""It's really a departure of the whole Western-educated, globally integratedofficials, who basically are all timed out and retired.""","""他们首先都是党员，当然，也是习近平的亲密伙伴，""哈佛大学肯尼迪政府学院的中国问题专家托尼·赛奇说。""受过西方教育、全球一体化的官员确实是在整体离场，他们基本上都已经任满并且退休了。"""
"Female leaders have become more scarce under Mr. Xi's tenure. For the first time in decades, the top 24 members of the party are all men. Shen Yiqin, a former party chief of the southwestern province of Guizhou, may be named a state councilor.",在习近平的任期内，女性领导人变得更少了。党内最高级别的24名成员都是男性，这是几十年来的第一次。贵州省前省委书记谌贻琴可能被任命为国务委员。
The party has also signaled a major institutional shake-up that will help carry out Mr. Xi's agenda by entrenching the party deeper into state ministries and Chinese society by extension.,党还发出了重大机构调整的信号，这将有助于执行习近平的议程，进一步加强中共对国家部委和中国社会的控制。
"Few details have been released so far, but at a meeting of national leaders on Tuesday, Mr. Xi called for ""deepening reform of the party and state institutions."" China watchers are discussing changes that could see China's sprawling security apparatus and financial watchdogs fall under closer supervision by Mr. Xi and the party.","迄今为止公布的细节很少，但在周二的国家领导人会议上，习近平呼吁""深化党和国家机构改革""。中国的观察者正在讨论一些变化，它们可能会使中国庞大的安全机构和金融监督机构处于习近平和党的更密切的监督之下。"
"""Xi Jinping has a pretty sizable set of goals he wants the party-state to achieve between now and 2035,"" said Jude Blanchette, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank. Frustrations with a sprawling Chinese bureaucracy are ""driving these heavy-handed interventions,"" he said.","""习近平有一套相当可观的目标，从现在开始，他希望党和国家能在2035年之前实现，""智库战略与国际研究中心的中国问题专家白明(Jude Blanchette)说。他表示，对庞大中国官僚机构的不满""推动了这些强硬的干预措施""。"
"Xi Jinping is on the political march again. After a turbulent year that ended in faltering growth, widespread protests, and a surge of deaths after China abruptly abandoned Covid controls, China's top leader is poised to secure even more power at the annual gathering of the national legislature that opened on Sunday.","习近平再次踏上政治征程。在结束了经济增长乏力、各地爆发抗议活动，以及突然放弃新冠""清零""措施后死亡人数激增的动荡的一年之后，中国的最高领导人正蓄势待发，准备在周日开幕的全国人民代表大会上获得更多的权力。"
"At the start of the National People's Congress, the Chinese government laid out a post-Covid agenda centered on reviving the economy with a 5 percent growth target, raising spending on military, education and social needs, and augmenting Mr. Xi's already formidable influence.",在开幕式上，中国政府提出了后疫情时代的议程，它以重振经济为重点，制定了5%的增长目标，并提高军事、教育和社会需求方面的支出，进一步扩大习近平已有的强大影响力。
"The nearly 3,000 carefully selected delegates to the legislature, who are meeting for nine days in Beijing, are set to appoint a new cohort of government leaders crowded with Mr. Xi's loyalists by the end of the congress. They are also expected to approve a bureaucratic reorganization that will further concentrate policymaking under Mr. Xi and the party.",近3000名经过精心挑选的人大代表将在北京举行为期九天的会议，他们将在大会结束前将下届政府委任给一个充满了习近平亲信的领导班子。预计他们还将批准中共提出的《党和国家机构改革方案》，将制定决策的权力进一步集中在习近平和中共手里。
"""Xi is back, and he has wasted no time in arrogating more powers to himself,"" said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, who studies Chinese politics. Mr. Xi and other leaders had calculated that they could pull back Covid controls and endure a wave of what may have been a million or more deaths across China without unleashing a long, severe political crisis, Mr. Lam said.","""习近平回来了，他正在为揽下更多权力迅速行动起来，""在詹姆斯敦基金会研究中国政治的高级研究员林和立说。习近平和其他领导人已有的算计是，他们能够在不引发一场长期严重政治危机的情况下取消严格的新冠病毒控制措施、承受中国各地后续可能一百万或更多的死亡，林和立说道。"
"""The leadership made this big gamble on this about-face on pandemic policy,"" Mr. Lam said, ""and the gamble has, at least on the surface, worked out so far politically, despite all the deaths in the first month of the reversal.""","""领导层在新冠疫情政策180度大转弯上下了大赌注，""林和立说，""至少从表面上看，这场赌博到目前为止在政治上很成功，尽管在政策逆转后的第一个月里死了那么多人。"""
"Since the collapse of its stringent ""zero Covid"" policy in December, the Chinese leadership has shifted its focus to restoring growth and creating jobs, seeking to reassure private businesses that they are a vital part of the national economy.","自从去年12月突然取消了严格的新冠""清零""政策以来，中国领导层已将重点转移到恢复经济增长、创造就业机会上来，当局试图说服民营部门，它们是国民经济的一个重要组成部分。"
"The question hanging over China is whether Mr. Xi can instill economic confidence, especially among private investors, while continuing to expand the Communist Party's control over the country, as he has signaled he will do.",中国一个悬而未决的问题是，习近平是否能逐步培养经济信心，尤其是在私人投资者当中，同时继续扩大中共对国家的控制，正如他暗示将要做的那样。
"""He has not fundamentally given up on his original goals; it's a temporary tactical retreat,"" Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College who studies Chinese politics, said in an interview. ""But in order to get the economy truly back on track, he needs to convince the skeptics that he's now for real.""","""他并没有从根本上放弃他的最初目标;这只是一个临时的战术撤退，""克莱蒙麦肯纳学院研究中国政治的教授裴敏欣在接受采访时说。""但为了让经济真正重回正轨，他需要使怀疑者相信，他现在要动真格了。"""
"Mr. Xi also wants to elevate China into a technologically advanced superpower capable of standing up to Washington as a peer, a vision that he now calls ""Chinese-style modernization."" In a recent speech, he suggested that any pragmatic shifts in policy must not be seen as a U-turn from those grand goals.","习近平还想把中国提升为一个拥有先进技术的超级大国，有与美国匹敌的能力，他现在将这个愿景称为""中国式现代化""。他在最近的一次讲话中暗示，政策的任何务实转变都不能被视为偏离这些宏伟目标的180度大转弯。"
"""We must keep our eyes fixed on the great issues that bear on the rise or fall, success or failure, of the party and country, and that could shake everything with one touch,"" he told a meeting of recently promoted party officials last month. ""We need to organically meld strategic principle with tactical flexibility.""","我们必须""着眼于解决事关党和国家事业兴衰成败、牵一发而动全身的重大问题""，他上个月在中央党校对新晋升的干部们发表讲话时说。""要把战略的原则性和策略的灵活性有机结合起来。"""
"In a sign of Beijing's concern about the challenges of reinvigorating the economy, the premier, Li Keqiang, said that China would aim to expand growth by ""around 5 percent"" this year, a relatively modest target. Exports have faltered this winter as global demand has stalled, while it is unclear if China's consumers can help sustain a recovery, and business confidence is weak.","总理李克强说，中国今年的经济增长目标是""5%左右""，这目标相对不高，表明政府对重振经济的挑战仍有所担忧。由于全球需求停滞，中国今冬的出口已放缓，而国内消费者能否帮助支撑经济复苏尚不明朗，国内的商业信心也很弱。"
"""Uncertainties in the external environment are on the rise,"" he told the congress. ""At home, the foundation for stable growth needs to be consolidated, insufficient demand remains a pronounced problem, and the expectations of private investors and businesses are unstable.""","""外部环境不确定性加大，""李克强在全国人大上说。""国内经济增长企稳向上基础尚需巩固，需求不足仍是突出矛盾，民间投资和民营企业预期不稳。"""
"Many economists regard 3 percent, China's official growth rate last year, as an overstatement of the true performance of the economy, which had been smothered by stringent ""zero Covid"" measures and spreading pandemic lockdowns.","许多经济学家认为，中国去年3%的官方增长数字夸大了经济的真实表现。中国严格的新冠""清零""措施和大面积的封控抑制了经济增长。"
"After a dismal December, the economy has shown signs of a recovery. Shopping areas are again crowded, and factory activity is having its strongest acceleration in more than a decade.",去年12月的经济表现惨淡，但那之后已出现了复苏迹象。城市的购物中心再次变得热闹起来，制造业正在以十多年来最强劲的速度反弹。
"Li Bin, a 35-year-old technician in Tianjin, said during a lunchtime riverside walk on Friday that he had barely ventured out of his home for the past three years except to work. But in recent weeks, he said, ""I have saved less, felt free, eaten more, gone out to play more, and returned to normal activity.""","家住天津的35岁技术人员李斌(音)上周五的午餐时间在河边散步时说，在过去三年里，他除了去工作，几乎没有出过家门。但他说，最近几周，""存得少了，放开了，吃得多了，出去玩得多了，回归正常水平了。"""
"To help revive economic growth, China has eased its drive to rein in property developers, whose high debt levels are seen as a risk to the wider economy. The government has signaled that its regulatory crackdown on Big Tech had achieved its objectives.",为了帮助重振经济增长，中国已放松了对房地产开发商的严格限制，政府曾认为开发商的高额债务已给整体经济带来风险。政府还释放信号，表示对大型科技企业的监管打击已实现了目标。
"Seeking to lower tensions with the United States, Mr. Xi held talks with President Biden in November aimed at arresting the countries' slide toward a new cold war. But the relationship has only deteriorated since then. Beijing gave little ground after the Biden administration accused it of flying a spy balloon over the United States. Last month, Washington accused Beijing of considering sending lethal support to help Russia's war in Ukraine, a claim Chinese officials have rejected.",为了缓和与美国的紧张关系，习近平已在去年11月与拜登总统举行了会晤，以防两国走向新冷战。但两国关系在那之后出现了进一步恶化。拜登政府指责中国的间谍气球飞到美国上空后，中国政府几乎毫不让步。上个月，华盛顿指责北京正在考虑向俄罗斯提供致命性武器，帮助支持后者在乌克兰的战争，中国官员否认了这个说法。
"Beijing sees the United States as trying to contain China's rise, but it does not want the rivalry with Washington to slip out of control, said Chao Chun-shan, a Taiwanese political science professor who recently visited China and met senior Chinese officials.",最近去过中国并出席了与中国高级官员会晤的台湾政治学教授赵春山说，北京认为美国试图遏制中国的崛起，但它不希望与华盛顿的竞争关系失控。
"""Almost everyone I met told me that the United States will not permit a powerful China by its side, especially in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Professor Chao said. Their strategy, he added, is: ""Contesting without tipping into a rupture.""","赵春山说，""我见到的几乎所有人都对我说，美国不会允许一个强大的中国与其平起平坐，尤其是在印太地区。""他还说，他们的策略是""斗而不破""。"
"In a sign of the importance Beijing places on asserting its position in the world, the government also plans to raise its military budget by 7.2 percent, which would increase spending to nearly $225 billion, despite the strains that might impose on state finances. Spending on the foreign ministry and other diplomatic efforts will grow even faster, by 12.2 percent.",作为中国重视维护其世界地位的一个迹象，政府还计划将军事预算提高7.2%，将国防支出增加到15537亿元人民币，尽管这可能会给国家财政带来压力。外交部的预算以及其他用于外交努力的支出将有更大的增长，增长率达12.2%。
Mr. Xi has also urged his party to take a more hands-on approach in developing the country's science and technology capabilities to reduce its reliance on Western expertise. This directive has become more urgent as the United States has tightened restrictions on exports to China.,习近平还要求中共在发展国家的科学技术能力上亲力亲为，减少对西方专门技能的依赖。随着美国加大对中国的出口限制，这项指令已变得更加紧迫。
Mr. Xi also sees extending and cementing his own power as necessary to ensuring China's ascent in an increasingly perilous world.,习近平还认为，扩大和巩固自己的权力对于确保中国在日益危险的世界中崛起是必要的。
"The congress will almost certainly give him a groundbreaking third term as state president, atop his main title of Communist Party general secretary. And Mr. Xi will also use the congress to reorganize state ministries and agencies, centralizing more policymaking around him and the party.",全国人大将破天荒地授予习近平第三个国家主席任期几乎已成定局，除了国家主席，他还有中共中央总书记的头衔。习近平还将利用这次大会重组国家部委和机构，将更多决策权集中在他和中共手中。
"Scholars have said that the plan may include a new homeland security commission that will integrate police and state security agencies, reflecting Mr. Xi's emphasis on a national security state.",学者们表示，机构改革方案中可能包括一个负责国土安全的新的中央委员会，将对公安部和国安部进行统一领导，这反映了习近平对国家安全体制的重视。
"China's police and state security forces are already firmly in the grip of the Communist Party, and Mr. Xi has also built a National Security Commission to help extinguish threats, especially challenges to Communist Party power. The new homeland security commission may, however, try to bring greater cohesiveness to this collection of agencies.",中国的警察和国家安全部队已牢牢地掌握在中共手中。为了帮助消除威胁，尤其是对中共权力的挑战，习近平已经成立了中央国家安全委员会。但新的国土安全委员会也许会对国内的安全机构进行更大的整合。
"""It would be to put more political muscle behind Xi's obsession with immunizing the Communist Party from domestic and foreign threats to its rule,"" said Neil Thomas, a researcher who will soon begin as a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis.","""这会在习近平痴迷的问题上赋予他更多的政治威力，他一直想让中共免受国内外对其统治的威胁，""即将在亚洲协会政策研究所的中国分析中心担任研究员的牛犇(Neil Thomas)说。"
"On Sunday, the capital, Beijing, was itself a showcase of the government's twin agendas of restoring normalcy and maintaining strict control. Visitors have returned to the city in droves since Covid restrictions ended, swamping tourist sites, including Tiananmen Square, next to the Great Hall of the People where the legislative meeting was taking place.",周日的首都北京本身就是一个展示场所，用来呈现政府既要恢复正常又要保持严格控制的双重议程。自从政府解除了限制疫情的措施以来，成群结队的游客已经回来了，旅游景点人满为患，其中包括天安门广场，正在举行人大会议的人民大会堂就在这里。
"But on Sunday, police officers had closed many of the subway exits opening onto the square, forcing visitors into long lines for identification checks. Some people discovered upon arriving to the square that only those with advance reservations were being allowed in a holdover policy from the Covid era. Disappointed, they left.",不过，警察已在周日关闭了多个通往广场的地铁站出口，游客必须排长队接受身份检查。一些人到了广场后才发现，进广场需要提前预约，这是新冠疫情时代遗留下来的政策。他们只能失望地离去。
"China's top leader, Xi Jinping, met with President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus on Wednesday, hosting one of the Kremlin's closest allies in Beijing as the United States fears growing Chinese support for Russia and its war in Ukraine.",中国最高领导人习近平于周三会见白俄罗斯总统亚历山大·卢卡申科，在美国担心中国对俄罗斯及其在乌克兰的战争不断加大支持之际，他在北京接待了这位俄罗斯最亲密的盟友之一。
"After a welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, the two leaders discussed enhancing business ties and sharing technologies, according to the Belarusian state news media. Although there was no explicit mention of the war, according to the report, the United States says the visit by the Belarusian leader is a sign of China's strengthening ties with Moscow.",据白俄罗斯国家新闻媒体报道，在人民大会堂举行欢迎仪式后，两国领导人讨论了加强商业合作和技术共享的问题。尽管据报道，双方并未明确提及战争，但美国称白俄罗斯领导人的访问标志着中俄关系的加深。
"Russia used Belarus as a staging ground for its invasion of Ukraine a year ago, and the meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Lukashenko was being watched closely by Western and Ukrainian officials for signs of cooperation that could translate for more battlefield support for Moscow. The Biden administration has accused Beijing of considering supplying the Russian military with lethal weapons, an accusation that China has denied.",一年前，俄罗斯将白俄罗斯当做入侵乌克兰的集结地，而今，西方和乌克兰官员都在密切关注习近平与卢卡申科的会晤，寻找可能转化为对莫斯科提供更多战场支持的合作迹象。拜登政府批评中国考虑向俄罗斯军队提供致命性武器，中国否认了这一指控。
"Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research institute, said this week that Mr. Lukashenko could help facilitate the evasion of Western sanctions against Moscow, and raised the possibility that China could send weapons and ammunition to Russia through Belarus.",总部位于华盛顿的战争研究所的研究员本周表示，卢卡申科或将帮助俄罗斯规避西方制裁，中国还有可能通过白俄罗斯向俄罗斯运送武器和弹药。
"For his part, Mr. Lukashenko expressed support for China's global security and development initiatives, referring to Chinese policies that Beijing has promoted to counter Western-led responses toconflict andpoverty.",在谈到中国为对抗由西方主导的冲突和贫困应对措施而制定的政策时，卢卡申科表示他支持中国的全球安全和发展倡议。
"""Today's meeting is taking place at a very difficult time, requiring new nonstandard approaches and responsible political decisions,"" the Belarusian leader said. There was no immediate statement on the meeting from the Chinese government.","""今天的会晤正值一个非常艰难的时刻，需要新的非常规手段和负责任的政治决策，""这位白俄罗斯领导人说。中国政府没有立即就此番会晤发布公告。"
"Earlier in the day, Mr. Lukashenko held talks with China's premier, Li Keqiang, in a meeting in which he lauded the trade growth between Belarus and China and called for relations between the two countries to intensify, the Belarusian state news media reported.",白俄罗斯国家新闻媒体报道称，当天早些时候，卢卡申科与中国总理李克强举行了会谈，会上他赞扬了白中贸易增长，并呼吁加强两国关系。
"Friction has been increasing between Washington and Beijing. On Tuesday, a new House select committee on China held its first hearing, framing competition with Beijing as an ""existential struggle.""","美中之间的摩擦一直在增加。周二，众议院新成立的中国问题特别委员会举行了首场听证会，将美中竞争定性为""生存斗争""。"
"The accusations that China is considering supplying arms to Russia and a recent dispute over a spy balloon have raised tensions between the two superpowers, which are at odds over issues including TikTok, the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and the future of Ukraine.",中国正考虑向俄罗斯提供武器的指控和近来的间谍气球争端加剧了这两个超级大国之间的紧张关系，两国在TikTok、新冠疫情起源和乌克兰未来等问题上都存在分歧。
"Mr. Lukashenko, who sought Moscow's help quelling antigovernment protests in Belarus in 2020, allowed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to use his country's territory to stage Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a decision that resulted in the United States' imposing sanctions against Belarus.",卢卡申科曾在2020年寻求俄罗斯帮助来镇压白俄罗斯的反政府抗议活动，他允许俄罗斯总统普京利用本国领土发起对乌克兰的入侵，这一决定导致白俄罗斯遭到美国制裁。
China issued a proposal last week that outlined broad principles to end the fighting in Ukraine. The position paper was criticized by Western leaders for not offering detailed ideas and for aligning too closely with Russian interests.,中国上周发起一项倡议，概述了旨在结束乌克兰战争的宽泛原则。西方领导人批评该立场文件缺乏细节，而且过于贴近俄罗斯的利益。
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was careful not to criticize the proposal and instead seized on its release to call for his own meeting with Mr. Xi to discuss ways to end the war. China has yet to respond.,乌克兰总统泽连斯基态度谨慎，并未批评中国的倡议，而是趁此机会要求与习近平见面，讨论结束战争的办法。中国尚未回应。
"Western analysts said the meeting with Mr. Lukashenko underscored Mr. Xi's desire to lead a collection of nondemocratic states in opposition to the West. Closer ties with Belarus could also provide China with a better view of conditions on the ground in Ukraine, which shares a 674-mile border with Belarus.",西方分析人士表示，与卢卡申科会面凸显了习近平希望领导一批非民主国家对抗西方的愿望。与白俄罗斯建立更紧密关系还能让中国更好地了解乌克兰的实际情况，白乌两国的边境线长约1100公里。
"""Belarus could be a good channel to see if China can mediate more"" between Russia and Ukraine, said Wang Huiyao, the president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, a research group.","""白俄罗斯可能是一个很好的渠道，看看中国能不能(在俄乌之间)做更多调解，""位于北京的全球化智库理事长王辉耀表示。"
Mr. Lukashenko is likely to court more Chinese investment to help offset the sanctions imposed on Belarus. The two countries could also expand military cooperation to reduce Minsk's reliance on Russia.,卢卡申科可能会争取更多的中国投资，以帮助抵消白俄罗斯遭受的制裁。两国还可能扩大军事合作，减少明斯克对俄罗斯的依赖。
"""We have always been reliable friends of the Chinese people in the past decades and will be in the future,"" Mr. Lukashenko said in a recent interview with the Chinese state news media. ""Our people, especially under Western sanctions, know well who is the enemy and who is our friend,"" he added.","""过去几十年来，我们一直都是中国人民可靠的朋友，未来也永远会是如此，""卢卡申科最近在接受中国官媒访问时说道。他还表示，""我们的人民，特别是在遭受西方制裁的时期，已经看清楚了谁是敌谁是友。"""
"President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a three-day visit in which China's top leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to meet with him, lending support to one of Russia's staunchest allies amid growing concerns in the United States and Europe about China's position on the war in Ukraine.",白俄罗斯总统亚历山大·卢卡申科周二抵达北京，进行为期三天的访问，预计中国最高领导人习近平将与他会面，在美国和欧洲日益担忧中国对乌克兰战争的立场之际，向俄罗斯最坚定的盟友之一提供支持。
"Mr. Lukashenko, who has led Belarus since 1994, allowed Russia to use his country as a staging ground to invade Ukraine more than a year ago, which resulted in Western sanctions against Minsk. A 68-year-old authoritarian, Mr. Lukashenko has been wholly reliant on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia since the Kremlin helped him crush antigovernment protests in Belarus in 2020.",自1994年以来，卢卡申科一直是白俄罗斯的领导人，一年多前，他允许俄罗斯利用他的国家作为入侵乌克兰的集结地，这导致西方对明斯克实施制裁。自从2020年克里姆林宫帮助他镇压白俄罗斯的反政府抗议活动以来，68岁的专制者卢卡申科一直完全依赖俄罗斯总统普京。
"The United States said it viewed the visit by the leader of one of Moscow's client states as another sign of China's growing ties with the Kremlin and its support for Russia's side in the conflict in Ukraine, which has grown into another major flash point between the world's two superpowers.",美国表示，莫斯科的一个附庸国领导人访问中国，是中国与克里姆林宫关系日益密切，以及中国在乌克兰冲突中支持俄方的又一迹象，乌克兰冲突已成为两个超级大国之间的又一个主要爆发点。
"""The fact that the P.R.C. is now engaging with Lukashenko, who has, in effect, ceded his own sovereignty to Russia, is just another element of the P.R.C.'s deepening engagement with Russia, with all of those who are engaged with and supporting Russia's brutal war against Ukraine,"" Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, said on Monday, referring to the People's Republic of China.","""卢卡申科实际上已经将自己的主权让给了俄罗斯，而中华人民共和国现在与卢卡申科的接触，只是中国与俄罗斯、与所有那些参与并支持俄罗斯对乌克兰残酷战争者加深接触的另一个部分，""美国国务院发言人内德·普莱斯周一表示。"
"Mr. Lukashenko, speaking with reporters soon after arriving in Beijing late Tuesday, said that the United States was seeking to stir anti-Chinese sentiment in Europe.",周二晚些时候，卢卡申科抵达北京不久后对记者说，美国正试图在欧洲煽动反华情绪。
"""We understand that the Americans are pushing Europe to go down the anti-Chinese path,"" he said in remarks broadcast on Belarusian state media. ""Europe is resisting and rightly so, because if they fence themselves off from China, and God forbid they also come into conflict with China as America is also pressing Europe will disappear.""","""我们知道美国人正在推动欧洲走上反华道路，""他在白俄罗斯官方媒体播出的讲话中说。""欧洲是抗拒的，这是理所当然的，因为如果它们将自己与中国隔离开来——但愿这不会发生——它们也会与中国发生冲突，而美国还在施压——欧洲将会消失。"""
"The three-day visit comes a little more than a week after the United States accused Beijing of devising plans to help Russia bolster its diminishing stocks of weapons and ammunition. President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, warned China on Sunday that it would face ""real costs"" if it went through with the plans. Beijing has repeatedly denied that it has considered supplying Russia with lethal weapons, and has accused Washington of escalating the war by providing Ukraine with military equipment.","这次访问为期三天，一周多之前，美国指责北京制定计划，帮助俄罗斯加强其不断减少的武器和弹药库存。拜登总统的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文周日警告中国，如果实施这些计划，中国将面临""真正的代价""。北京一再否认它曾考虑向俄罗斯提供致命武器，并指责华盛顿向乌克兰提供军事装备，令战争升级。"
China is trying to straddle what analysts describe as a nearly impossible position by trying both to present itself as a neutral observer in the war in Ukraine and to maintain close strategic ties with Russia. The tough balancing act has undermined Beijing's efforts to court European powers that Chinese leaders view are necessary to revive the country's weakened economy and counter increasing competition from the United States.,中国既试图在乌克兰战争中扮演中立观察员的角色，又与俄罗斯保持密切的战略关系，做出分析人士认为几乎不可能实现的骑墙姿态。把握平衡的艰难破坏了北京向欧洲大国示好的努力，中国领导人认为这些大国是重振中国疲软经济和应对来自美国日益激烈的竞争所必需的。
"To buttress its claim of neutrality, China issued a proposal on Friday that outlined broad principles to end the fighting in Ukraine but it was widely dismissed by Western leaders for lacking details and any signs that Beijing was willing to distance itself from Moscow. Russia also expressed lukewarm enthusiasm for the proposal, with a Kremlin spokesman saying it was too early to discuss the ""nuances"" of the plan, the Russian state news media reported on Tuesday.","中国周五发布了一项提案，以支撑其中立主张，其中概述了结束乌克兰战争的总体原则——但西方领导人普遍反应冷淡，因为该提案缺乏细节，并且没有任何迹象表明北京愿意与莫斯科保持距离。据俄罗斯官方新闻媒体周二报道，俄罗斯对该提议也表示不温不火，克里姆林宫发言人表示，现在讨论该计划的""细微差别""还为时过早。"
"While the China-Russia relationship has at times been fractured by war and mistrust, it has also endured through the countries' communist roots and a desire to challenge Washington's global supremacy. The two countries proclaimed a ""no limits"" partnership more than a year ago, and Mr. Xi is expected to make a state visit to Moscow in the spring.","虽然中俄关系曾因战争和不信任破裂，但也因两国的共产主义根源和挑战美国全球霸权的愿望而得以延续。两国于一年多以前宣布建立""没有止境""的伙伴关系，预计习近平今春将对莫斯科进行国事访问。"
"Mr. Lukashenko's visit comes on the heels of recent trips to Beijing by other authoritarian leaders such as President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran and Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, highlighting China's ambition to lead an alternative world order free of American interventionism.",在卢卡申科到访前，伊朗总统易卜拉欣·莱希和柬埔寨首相洪森等其他专制领导人才刚刚访问北京，这凸显了中国的野心，那就是主导没有美国干涉主义的世界新秩序。
"Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, said tensions and disagreements often lay just beneath the surface of those relationships including with Russia and Belarus but they are rarely serious enough to overshadow their shared antipathy for the West.",新加坡南洋理工大学拉惹勒南国际研究院高级研究员潘睿凡(Raffaello Pantucci)表示，中国与俄罗斯和白俄罗斯等国之间的关系，往往是表象之下隐藏着紧张和分歧，但其严重程度很少能盖过他们对西方的共同反感。
"""The overarching strategic decision they've all made is that the West is their enemy and that is their No. 1 priority. That binds them all together,"" said Mr. Pantucci, author of ""Sinostan: China's Inadvertent Empire.""","""他们做出的首要战略决定是，西方是他们的敌人，这是他们的重中之重。这将他们都团结到了一起，""潘睿凡说，他是《中华斯坦——中国不经意造就的帝国》(Sinostan: China's Inadvertent Empire)一书的作者。"
"The Chinese state news media has hailed Mr. Lukashenko's visit as an example of China's respect for powers of all sizes, and suggested that the two countries could coordinate strategies to promote peace in Ukraine. It has also criticized the West for framing the trip as a sign of China's troubling role in Ukraine.",中国官媒将卢卡申科的访问宣扬为中国尊重各国的典范，并称中白两国能够协调战略，促进乌克兰的和平。官媒还批评西方将此次访问描述为中国在乌克兰问题上发出的令人不安的信号。
"""Western media outlets still view this visit through a biased lens, describing Belarus as Russia's 'little ally' and suggesting that China's 'expanding influence' should be a cause for concern,"" read a Global Times editorial headlined ""Lukashenko's China Trip Shows West's Petty-Minded Sensitivity.""","""一些美西方舆论依然戴着有色眼镜看待这次访问，他们将白俄罗斯描述为俄罗斯的'小盟友'，并暗示要警惕中国'扩大影响力'，""环球时报社评《卢卡申科访华，美西方的敏感很小心眼》这样写道。"
"Beijing and Minsk agreed to diplomatic ties shortly after Belarus declared independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. Those ties were upgraded in 2022 to an ""all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership,"" a label that belies strains in the relationship in recent years over Belarus's expectations of greater Chinese investment and trade.","白俄罗斯在1991年宣布脱离前苏联独立后不久，就同意与中国建立外交关系。两国联系在2022年升级为""全天候全面战略伙伴关系""，这一称谓掩盖了近年来白俄罗斯希望中国加大投资和贸易而导致两国关系紧张的事实。"
"Economic support will be at the top of Mr. Lukashenko's agenda, analysts say, as Belarus finds itself increasingly isolated by sanctions. Closer ties with Beijing can also serve as a counterweight to Russia, which is responsible for half of Belarus's foreign trade.",分析人士称，由于白俄罗斯遭到的孤立和制裁越来越多，寻求经济支持将成为卢卡申科的首要议程。对华建立更紧密的关系也能起到制衡俄罗斯的作用，白俄罗斯的一半对外贸易都来自俄罗斯。
"""Today, not a single issue in the world can be resolved without China,"" Mr. Lukashenko said in an interview with Chinese state media.","""任何国际问题的解决都离不开中国，""卢卡申科在接受中国官媒的访问时表示。"
"Mr. Lukashenko's visit will also be watched closely for signs of any new military or technological cooperation that could translate to the battlefield in Ukraine. The two countries already work together to produce the ""Polonez"" multiple rocket launcher, which experts say has been equipped with modified Chinese-made rockets.","卢卡申科的访问是否将涉及任何可能演变为乌克兰战场军事或技术新合作的迹象，也将受到密切关注。两国已经在合作生产""波罗乃兹""多管火箭炮，专家称其装备了中国改造的火箭弹。"
"In a joint statement released last year, Mr. Lukashenko and Mr. Xi pledged to ""further expand practical cooperation in every sphere between the two militaries.""","在去年的一份联合公告中，卢卡申科与习近平承诺将""进一步扩大两军各领域务实合作""。"
"This is how China's ruling Communist Party wants people to remember how it handled the Covid-19 pandemic: It was a ""miracle in human history."" Every measure the government imposed was rooted in science, supported by the masses and, ultimately, ""completely correct.""","这是执政的中国共产党想人们记住的东西:它应对新冠病毒大流行的做法是""人类文明史""的奇迹。政府采取的每项措施都有科学依据，得到群众的支持，而且被证明""是完全正确的""。"
"The party is waging an ambitious propaganda campaign to rewrite the public's memory of ""zero Covid,"" a signature policy of China's leader, Xi Jinping, that helped contain the virus for almost three years but went to such extreme lengths that it smothered the economy and set off widespread opposition. In a decree that was published after a recent meeting of top officials and championed by a barrage of state media editorials, a newly triumphant narrative has emerged, aimed at bolstering Mr. Xi's authority and deterring dissent.","中共正在展开一场雄心勃勃的宣传运动，以改写公众对新冠""清零""的记忆，那是中国领导人习近平标志性的政策，曾帮助将新冠病毒遏制了近三年，但该措施如此极端，严重损害了经济，并引发了广泛的反对。在最近一次高级官员会议后的公告中，出现了一个新的胜利叙事，得到官媒上大量社评的拥护，目的是巩固习近平的权威，威慑异见。"
"The party is pushing its message at a time of heightening tensions with the United States over China's handling of the pandemic, including the secrecy it has shrouded over investigations into the virus's origins. The U.S. Energy Department recently concluded with ""low confidence"" that the Covid-19 virus likely originated from an accidental lab leak in China, a hypothesis that Beijing has denied and called a smear campaign even as some right-wing American media outlets have embraced it as fact.","中共推出这个叙事是在中美关系更加紧张之际，美国对中国处理新冠大流行的做法，包括在病毒溯源调查中隐瞒情况不满。美国能源部最近以""低置信度""得出结论:新冠病毒可能起源于中国实验室的意外泄漏，中国政府对此予以否认，称其为抹黑中国的努力，尽管一些美国右翼媒体已将这个假说接受为事实。"
"And, forced to defend its policies domestically, China's official messaging acknowledges none of the extremes of ""zero Covid,"" when authorities placed hundreds of millions of people under some form of lockdown last year, in some cases beating residents for leaving their homes or separating their children from them. Also missing from the narrative is the chaos that ensued after the policy's abrupt dismantling in early December, which left hospitals and crematories unprepared for the explosion in new infections and deaths.","而且，因为必需为国内政策辩护，官方传递的信息丝毫不承认""清零""措施下的极端做法，去年，当局曾将数亿人置于某种形式的封控之下，还发生了殴打离家居民，或将大人和孩子分开隔离的情况。官方叙事也不提去年12月初政府突然取消了""清零""政策后出现的混乱局面，政策180度大转弯导致感染病例和死亡人数激增，让医院和火葬场措手不及。"
"Instead, as the viral wave subsides, the party has declared that its efforts led China to a ""decisive victory"" over the virus, with what it claims is the lowest Covid death rate of any country in the world. Officials have sought to frame the abandoning of ""zero Covid"" as a carefully orchestrated pivot that was ""optimized"" to prioritize the health of its citizens. The term ""zero Covid"" itself, once ubiquitous, has vanished from the party's rhetoric.","相反，随着国内感染浪潮的消退，中共宣布，中国的新冠抗疫努力取得了""决定性胜利""，并声称中国是世界上所有国家中新冠病毒死亡率最低的国家。官员们试图将放弃""清零""政策描述为精心策划的转折，是政府优先考虑人民的生命健康，对政策进行了""优化""。""清零""一词曾无处不在，现已从中共的新叙事中消失。"
"""The party is betting on the fact that if they just emphasize the positive evidence, then somehow after several years, people will have forgotten about all of this,"" said Willy Lam, an analyst of Chinese politics who is a senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation, a think tank. ""But this time around, we have seen very widespread expressions of dissent.""","""中共指望的是，如果他们只强调正面的东西，人们多少会在几年后忘掉这一切，""智囊团詹姆斯敦基金会的高级研究员、中国政治分析师林和立说。""但这次，我们已看到了非常广泛的异见表达。"""
"China has long used censorship and propaganda to shape consequential moments in history that challenged the Communist Party's legitimacy, a recurring exercise in state-sponsored amnesia. In recent months, officials have been quietly arresting and detaining several people who had participated in the nationwide protests last November against ""zero Covid,"" the biggest challenge to the country's authoritarian leadership since the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.","中国长期以来用审查和宣传来塑造挑战中共合法性的重要历史时刻，一次又一次地把受国家支持的失忆症强加于人民。近几个月来，官员们一直在秘密逮捕和拘留多名参加去年11月全国各地抗议""清零""活动的人，这些抗议活动是自天安门广场1989年的民主抗议活动以来，对中国独裁领导者们的最大挑战。"
"But the aftermath of the pandemic may be especially challenging for the party to bury, as feelings of whiplash, grief and frustration simmer just beneath the surface for many Chinese residents.",但中共想掩埋新冠大流行的创伤也许尤其困难，因为胜利叙事的表面下是许多中国老百姓对政策突变难以抑制的悲伤和不满。
"""When I see government propaganda now about the pandemic, I feel sick,"" said Liu Zhiye, 31, who works in real estate in Guangzhou, a southern city. ""I try my best not to read it.""","""我现在每次看到政府关于新冠病毒疫情的宣传都感到恶心，""现年31岁的刘志业(音)说，他在南方城市广州从事房地产工作。""我尽量不看这些东西。"""
"Analysts say the campaign is aimed at quashing any resentment over the fact that China paid an enormous price in economic loss and trauma to enforce ""zero Covid"" yet still suffered devastating health consequences, particularly among older adults.","分析人士称，宣传运动的目的是消除人们对一个事实的不满:中国为实施""清零""政策付出了巨大的经济代价和极大的身心创伤，但仍未能避免毁灭性的健康后果，尤其是对于老年人来说。"
"Epidemiologists have estimated China's Covid wave killed around 1 to 1.5 million people. But China's official death toll for the entire pandemic is about 83,000 people, which researchers and even many Chinese commenters on social media regard as a severe undercount. A lower death tally helps bolster the government's assertion throughout the pandemic that its model of one-party political control is superior to democracy.","据流行病学家估计，中国放弃""清零""后的新冠病毒感染浪潮导致了约100万至150万人死亡。但中国官方公布的整个大流行期间的新冠死亡人数只有大约8.3万人，研究人员认为这个数字被严重低估，就连社交媒体上的许多中国评论者也这样认为。更低的死亡人数有助于支持政府在整个大流行期间的主张，那就是，中国一党专政的控制模式优于民主制度。"
"""The government wants to say to people that their sacrifice was worth it,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.","""政府想告诉人们，他们的牺牲是值得的，""美国外交关系委员会的全球卫生专家黄严忠说。"
"For most of the pandemic, the looming threat of the virus punctuated the official rhetoric at all levels of Chinese government. Mr. Xi mobilized the country by declaring a ""people's war"" against the virus, and a top party committee warned that local officials who hid infections would be ""forever nailed to history's pillar of shame."" State media outlets referred to the lockdowns of Wuhan in 2020 and Shanghai last year as ""safeguarding,"" as if the authorities were protecting citizens from an invading force.","在大流行的大部分时间里，中国各级政府的官方说法时不时会强调病毒迫在眉睫的威胁。习近平宣布，要打一场抗击新冠病毒的""人民战争""，以此来动员全国人民。中共中央政法委警告说，隐瞒疫情的地方官员将""永远被钉在历史的耻辱柱上""。官媒将2020年的武汉封城和去年的上海封城称为""保卫战""，就好像当局要保护人民不受武装入侵那样。"
"When the party's abrupt U-turn of its ""zero Covid"" policy accelerated infections and deaths, government censors initially struggled to find a coherent narrative.","中共的""清零""政策突然来了个180度大转弯，引发了感染人数和死亡人数激增后，政府的审查部门最初曾经很难找到一个连贯的叙事。"
"Then came the party's declaration this month that its pandemic policies were ""completely correct,"" after a closed-door meeting of the country's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, led by Mr. Xi. The lengthy decree sounded like the official conclusion of a chapter in the country's history, with no space for further debate.","后来，中国最高决策机构、习近平领导的中共中央政治局常务委员会的闭门会议之后，中共在本月宣布，该国的抗疫政策""是完全正确的""。习近平在会上的讲话听起来像是正式宣布中国历史上一个篇章的结束，没有任何进一步辩论的余地。"
"Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College who studies Chinese politics, said the meeting signaled a dramatic change in the party's narrative on the reversal of ""zero Covid.""","克莱蒙麦肯纳学院研究中国政治的教授裴敏欣说，这次会议示意着，中共对新冠""清零""政策180度大转弯的叙事发生了巨大变化。"
"""Before that, it was tentative. Now, it's quite aggressive messaging. The words they're using now are really astonishing,"" Professor Pei said.","""会议召开前，中共的叙事是试探性的。现在是相当声势浩大地传递这个叙事。他们现在用的词语十分令人惊讶，""裴敏欣说。"
"""I expect in the next few weeks, you will see a proper campaign accentuating this triumphant message,"" he added.","""我估计在接下来的几周里会有一场真正的宣传活动，强调这种大获全胜的信息，""裴敏欣还说。"
"In a sign of how much the party intends to control the discussion, a social media post by a state television network about the meeting censored thousands of comments underneath it, displaying only a few dozen that praised the government.",国家电视台在其社交媒体账号上发的会议报道下，几千条评论已被审查，只剩下几十条赞扬政府的评论。这表明该党打算在多大程度上控制讨论。
"Attempts to resurface painful memories from the ""zero Covid"" era have been censored online. Slogans like ""we want food, not Covid tests"" a rallying cry during last year's protests have also been scrubbed from the Chinese internet.","找回""清零""时代痛苦记忆的尝试已在网上受到审查。人们在去年抗议活动中喊出的""不要核酸要吃饭""等口号也已从中国的互联网上消失。"
"As the Covid wave seemed to recede in January, state media outlets did warn about the lingering effects of long Covid, but some struck a more lighthearted tone. They borrowed a phrase trending on social media that labeled anyone who had not yet tested positive as a ""final round player,"" essentially comparing escaping the virus to a video game.","国内的新冠感染浪潮似乎已在今年1月消退，虽然官媒确实警告过长新冠症状持续存在的影响，但一些媒体使用了更为轻松的语言。他们借用社交媒体上走红的一个短语，将从未检测出病毒阳性的人称为""决赛圈选手""，本质上将避免感染病毒比作电子游戏。"
"That same month, during Lunar New Year, a televised variety show watched by hundreds of millions of Chinese people made almost no mention of the pandemic. One of the few references was in a performance of a sunny ballad called ""It Will Be Better Soon."" The lyrics included the line: ""No more using masks.""","今年1月，好几亿中国人通过电视观看的春节联欢晚会对新冠疫情几乎只字不提，为数不多提到疫情的表演包括一首名为《很快就会好起来》的快乐民谣，其中有这样一句歌词:""不再戴口罩。"""
"The government's messaging is in line with efforts to restore the public's confidence, both in the party's leadership and in the country's future. As China sets out to revive a flagging economy, it will need Chinese consumers to spend money again on homes, cars and plane tickets.",政府传递的信息与恢复公众对党的领导和国家未来信心的努力一致。随着政府开始重振萎靡不振的经济，中国需要消费者们再次把钱花在买房、买车、买机票上。
"Many Chinese are indeed keen to put the pandemic behind them and look toward the future, to find jobs, rebuild struggling businesses and reconnect with the world.",许多中国人确实渴望将新冠疫情抛在脑后，放眼未来，找工作，恢复陷入困境的业务，重新与世界建立联系。
"On a trip back home to Shanghai this month, Rose Luqiu, an assistant professor of journalism at the Hong Kong Baptist University, found the memory of Covid to be a polarizing topic among her family and friends. Some people told her the experience made them consider leaving China.",香港浸会大学新闻学助理教授吕丘露薇本月回上海老家时发现，对新冠疫情的记忆在她的家人和朋友中是一个引发对立的话题。一些人告诉她，疫情的经历让他们考虑离开中国。
"But many others would change the subject, she said, recognizing that complaining in an authoritarian state was an exercise in futility. ""People just want to get rid of all those bad memories,"" Ms. Luqiu said.","但她说，许多其他人会改变话题，他们认为在专制国家里，抱怨是徒劳的。""人们只想摆脱所有那些不好的记忆，""吕丘露薇说。"
"From the beginning of the pandemic, the government has sought to silence those who challenged the official narrative. Officials disciplined Li Wenliang, a doctor in Wuhan, after he issued a warning in December 2019 about a mysterious new virus that ended up infecting and killing him. They arrested Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist who tried to document the Wuhan outbreak, and sentenced her to four years in prison.",自新冠疫情开始以来，政府就一直试图让那些挑战官方叙事的人闭嘴。武汉医生李文亮在2019年12月对一个神秘的新型病毒发出警告后，警察对他进行了训诫，他最终在感染病毒后死亡。警方逮捕了试图记录武汉疫情的公民记者张展，判处她四年有期徒刑。
"Mr. Liu, in Guangzhou, said he was eager to stop masking and to travel again. But he said he did not want the memory of the last three years from the draconian restrictions to the widespread protests to be erased.",广州的刘志业说，他很想再也不戴口罩，重新去旅行。但他说，他不希望让过去三年的记忆被抹去，包括对严厉限制措施和大范围抗议活动的记忆。
"""As long as there are people who can remember the suffering and absurdities of the past three years,"" he said, ""then we can fight against society forgetting.""","""只要还有人记得过去三年的苦难和荒谬，我们就能与社会的遗忘作斗争，""他说。"
"WASHINGTON The Energy Department's conclusion, with ""low confidence,"" that an accidental laboratory leak in China most likely caused the coronavirus pandemic has renewed questions about what sparked the worst public health crisis in a century and whether the virus at the heart of it was somehow connected to scientificresearch.","华盛顿——能源部得出""低置信度""结论，即中国实验室的一次意外泄漏很可能导致了新冠病毒大流行，再次引发人们质疑一个世纪以来最严重的公共卫生危机的起源——以及病毒是否在某种程度上与科学研究有关联。"
"Scientists and spy agencies have tried assiduously to answer that question, but conclusive evidence is hard to come by. The nation's intelligence agencies are split, and none of them changed their conclusions after seeing the Energy Department's findings, officials said.",科学家和间谍机构一直在孜孜不倦地试图回答这个问题，但很难找到决定性证据。官员们说，美国的情报机构存在分歧，并且它们在看到能源部的调查结果后都没有改变结论。
"Scientists who have studied the genetics of the virus, and the patterns by which it spread, say the most likely cause is that the virus jumped from live mammals to humans a scientific phenomenon known as ""zoonotic spillover"" at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, the city in which the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in late 2019.","研究了该病毒的遗传学及其传播模式的科学家表示，最可能的原因是在中国武汉华南海鲜批发市场，病毒从活体哺乳动物传播到了人类，这是一种被称为""人畜共患病溢出""的科学现象。武汉于2019年底出现了首例新冠病例。"
"But other scientists say there is evidence, albeit circumstantial, that the virus came from a lab, possibly the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which had deep expertise in researching coronaviruses. Lab accidents do happen; in 2014, after accidents involving bird flu and anthrax, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tightened its biosafety practices.",但其他科学家表示，尽管只有间接证据，但证据表明该病毒来自实验室，可能是武汉病毒研究所——一座专长于新冠病毒研究的实验室。实验室事故确实会发生，2014年，在禽流感和炭疽病事故发生后，美国疾病控制与预防中心加强了生物安全措施。
"The debate is politically fraught. The lab leak theory gained currency among Republicans in the spring of 2020 after President Donald J. Trump, who used inflammatory terms to blame China for the pandemic, latched onto the idea. Many Democrats have not been persuaded by the lab leak hypothesis; some say they believe the explanation of natural causes, and others say there may never be enough intelligence to draw a conclusion.",这场辩论充满政治色彩。2020年春天，实验室泄漏的说法在共和党人中流行起来，特朗普总统抓住这一说法做不放，此前他曾使用煽动性的措辞将大流行归咎于中国。许多民主党人没有被实验室泄漏假说说服。有些人说他们相信病毒是自然产生的说法，而另一些人则说可能永远没有足够的情报来得出结论。
"The Energy Department's findings have given a boost to House Republicans, who are investigating the pandemic's origins. But apart from the politics, experts say that understanding what caused a public health crisis that has killed nearly seven million people could help researchers understand how to prevent the next one.",能源部调查结果鼓舞了正在调查大流行病起源的众议院共和党人。但专家表示，除了政治因素之外，了解造成近700万人死亡的公共卫生危机的原因还可以帮助研究人员了解如何预防下一次危机。
"Here's what we know, and don't know, about the origins of the coronavirus.",以下是关于新冠病毒起源的已知和未知信息。
Why is it hard to know for certain how the pandemic started?,为什么很难确定大流行是如何开始的?
"It is often difficult to find the origins of viruses, but China has compounded that problem by making it very difficult to gather evidence.",病毒溯源通常很难，但中国让收集证据变得非常困难，从而使问题变得更加复杂。
"By the time Chinese researchers arrived to collect samples from the Huanan market, the police had shut down and disinfected the market because a number of people linked to it had become sick with what would later be recognized as Covid. No live market animals were left.",当中国研究人员抵达华南市场采集样本时，警方已经关闭了该市场并对其进行了消杀，因为许多与该市场相关的人患病，后来被确认感染了新冠病毒病。该市场没有活体动物留下来。
"Some scientists also believe that China has provided an incomplete picture of early Covid cases. And they worry that a directive to hospitals early in the outbreak to report illnesses specifically linked to the market may have led doctors to overlook other cases with no such ties, creating a biased snapshot of the spread.",一些科学家还认为，中国提供的早期新冠病例的情况并不完整。在疫情暴发初期，医院接到指示要求特别报告与市场相关的疾病，科学家担心这可能会导致医生忽视了没有此类关联的其他病例，从而对传播情况的认识产生了偏差。
What have scientists done to investigate?,科学家做了什么调查?
Experts have tried to work around the holes in the data.,专家们试图解决数据中的空缺。
Scientists have examined cases of patients hospitalized before the call went out for doctors to look for ties to the market. They have also mapped the locations of early Covid cases in Wuhan including both people who were initially linked to the market and those who were not and found what they say are signs that the virus started spreading at the market.,科学家们检查了在医生接到报告与市场相关病例指示之前的住院患者的病例。他们还绘制了武汉早期新冠病例的位置图，包括最初与市场有关联的人和没有关联的人，他们发现了病毒开始在市场传播的迹象。
"Some of those same scientists have studied maps of where investigators found the virus in the Huanan market, including walls, floors and other surfaces, and found that those samples clustered in an area of the market where live animals were sold.",其中一些科学家研究了调查人员在华南市场发现病毒的位置的地图，包括墙壁、地板和其他表面，并发现这些样本集中在市场上出售活体动物的区域。
"And separate genetic analyses from the very early stages of the pandemic, some scientists have said, suggest that the virus spilled over into people working or shopping at the market on two separate occasions.",一些科学家表示，在大流行非常早期进行的另一项基因分析表明，该病毒分别两次蔓延到在市场工作或购物的人身上。
"Other scientists have disputed that studies like those can indicate a market origin with much confidence. They have said, for example, that the evidence for two separate spillovers at the market could also be evidence of the virus evolving as it spread from person to person.",其他科学家质疑这样的研究能否可靠地表明病毒来自市场。例如，他们表示，市场中发现两起互无关联的溢出的证据，也可能证明病毒在人与人之间传播的过程中发生演化。
"Some have also argued that for all the attention being paid to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, not enough has been paid to a different research site in the city, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That center is much closer to the Huanan market.",一些科学家表示，由于人们将所有的关注放在武汉病毒研究所上，对该市另一个研究机构武汉疾病预防控制中心的关注不够。该中心距离华南市场更近。
Why do some people suspect a laboratory leak?,为什么有些人怀疑实验室泄漏?
"In October, Republicans on the Senate health committee published an analysis of the origins of the pandemic that argued it was ""most likely the result of a research-related incident,"" while acknowledging that the conclusion was ""not intended to be dispositive.""","10月，参议院卫生委员会的共和党人发表了一份对大流行起源的分析，认为""很可能是与研究相关的意外事件的结果""，同时承认该结论""并非旨在成为决定性结论""。"
"The report spotlighted what its authors described as holes in the natural origins theory, as well as ""persistent biosafety problems"" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The report, though, relied largely on existing public evidence, rather than new or classified information, and did not produce evidence to show that the Wuhan institute stored any virus in its collections that could have become the virus causing Covid-19, with or without scientific tinkering.","该报告强调了其作者所说的自然起源理论中的漏洞，以及武汉病毒研究所""持续存在的生物安全问题""。不过，该报告在很大程度上依赖于现有的公开证据，而不是新信息或机密信息，并且没有提供证据表明，武汉研究所在其样本库中存放的某种病毒日后可能成为导致新冠疫情的病毒，无论有没有进行科学修改。"
"The lab leak hypothesis is bolstered, the report said, by the absence of any published evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was circulating in animals before the pandemic. Samples of virus collected on refrigerators, countertops and other surfaces at the Huanan market were genetically similar to human samples, suggesting the virus was shed by humans, not animals, it said.",报告称，由于没有任何公开证据表明导致新冠的病毒SARS-CoV-2在大流行之前在动物中传播，这支持了实验室泄漏假说。报告称，在华南市场的冰箱、台面和其他表面收集的病毒样本与人类样本在基因上相似，这表明该病毒是由人类而非动物传播的。
"But some experts said the inability to find an infected animal did not prove anything, because China shut down the market and killed all of its animals before they could be tested.",但一些专家表示，找不到受感染的动物并不能证明什么，因为中国关闭了市场并杀死了所有的动物，没有来得及对它们进行检测。
"In 2018, before the pandemic, the Wuhan institute and its partners including EcoHealth Alliance, a research group whose work has been financed by the United States sought Defense Department funding to collect and experiment on coronaviruses with novel traits that would make them highly transmissible in humans.","2018年，在大流行之前，武汉研究所及其合作伙伴——包括由美国资助的研究小组""生态健康联盟""——寻求国防部的资助，以收集和实验具有新特征的新冠病毒，这些特征将使它们在人类之间具有高度传播性。"
"The group project was never funded. But the report pointed to that proposal, noting that the virus that causes Covid-19 has traits similar to what the researchers were looking for. That has persuaded some scientists that a lab leak was possible. The Senate Republican report surmised that the virus may have escaped perhaps by infecting a researcher who then carried it outside the lab.",该小组项目从未获得经费。但报告指向该提议，并指出导致新冠的病毒与研究人员正在研究的病毒具有相似的特征。这让一些科学家相信实验室泄漏是可能的。参议院共和党人的报告推测有可能发生了病毒逃逸——可能一名感染了病毒的研究人员将其带出了实验室。
"The National Institutes of Health paid for some of EcoHealth Alliance's work in Wuhan, but N.I.H. officials have repeatedly saidthe viruses being studied with American taxpayer dollars bore no genetic resemblance to the one that causes Covid-19. But Dr. Lawrence A. Tabak, the N.I.H.'s acting director, acknowledged during a recent congressional hearing that he did not know what other work the Wuhan institute was doing.",美国国家卫生院为生态健康联盟在武汉的部分工作支付了一部分费用，但卫生院官员们一再表示，用美国纳税人的钱研究的病毒与导致新冠的病毒在基因上没有相似之处。但卫生院代理主任劳伦斯·A·塔巴克在最近的一次国会听证会上承认，他对武汉研究所的其他工作不知情。
|27| What does the American intelligence community say?,美国情报界怎么说?
"In May 2021, severalmonths after he took office, President Biden ordered the nation's intelligence agencies to conduct a 90-day inquiry into the cause of the pandemic. The findings of that review were released in August 2021 and reaffirmed what the agencies had previously said: Both the natural origins theory and the lab leak theory were plausible.",2021年5月，上任几个月后的拜登总统命令国家情报机构对大流行的原因进行为期90天的调查。该审查的结果于2021年8月发布，并重申了这些机构之前所说的话:自然起源理论和实验室泄漏理论都有可能。
"In a statement at the time, Mr. Biden called on China to be more transparent about what had led to the emergence of the virus there in late 2019.",在当时的一份声明中，拜登呼吁中国对病毒在2019年底出现在该国的原因提高透明度。
"The Energy Department's new conclusion is based on intelligence that is not publicly available, so it is difficult to know what accounted for the change. But the department's use of the phrase ""low confidence"" indicates that its level of certainty is not high. The F.B.I., however, has concluded with ""moderate confidence"" that the virus emerged accidentally from a lab.","能源部的新结论是基于未公开的情报得出的，因此很难知道是什么导致了这一变化。但该部门使用""低置信度""一词表明其确定性水平不高。然而，FBI以""中等置信度""得出结论称该病毒是从实验室意外出现的。"
"Four other intelligence agencies and the National Intelligence Council have concluded, with low confidence, that the virus most likely emerged through natural transmission. The C.I.A., the nation's pre-eminent spy agency, has not taken a position and remains undecided.",其他四个情报机构和国家情报委员会得出的结论是，该病毒很可能是通过自然传播出现的，但置信度低。美国最显要的间谍机构CIA尚未表明立场，且没有得出结论。
What is Congress doing to address the question?,针对这一问题，国会在做什么?
House Republicans have been trying to investigate the origins of the pandemic and gather evidence that might shed light on what caused it including whether China concealed facts about the initial outbreak and what research American tax dollars may have financed in Wuhan.,众议院共和党人一直在努力调查大流行的起源，并收集可能揭示大流行原因的证据——包括中国是否隐瞒了与最初暴发有关的事实，以及美国纳税人的钱可能被用于资助了武汉的哪些研究。
"Now that Republicans are in charge of the House, that investigative work is escalating in several committees, including the Intelligence Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. The subcommittee will hold its first hearing on the origins question on March 8, a spokeswoman said.",现在共和党人掌管了众议院，调查工作在几个委员会中不断升级，包括情报委员会、能源和商业委员会以及新冠病毒大流行特别小组委员会。一位发言人表示，该小组委员会将于3月8日就溯源问题举行首次听证会。
"China accused the United States of politicizing the coronavirus pandemic again on Monday, in response to reports that the Energy Department had concluded that an accidental laboratory leak had likely triggered the spread of Covid worldwide.",周一，中国再次指责美国将新冠病毒大流行政治化，以回应之前的有关报道，即美国能源部得出了结论，认为新冠病毒的全球传播是由实验室的意外泄漏所致。
"The rebuke marks the latest salvo in a running war of words between the two countries over the origins of the virus, an issue that has taken on as much of a political dimension as a scientific one as the rivalry between the two superpowers deepens.",这一指责标志着两国就病毒起源展开的最新一波唇枪舌战，随着中美这两个超级大国之间的竞争加剧，该问题在政治层面的影响力变得跟科学层面的一样大。
"""Covid tracing is a scientific issue that should not be politicized,"" Mao Ning, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, said of the Energy Department's conclusion. She then repeated calls for the United States to ""stop defaming China"" by raising the lab leak theory.","""新冠病毒溯源是科学问题，不应当被政治化，""中国外交部发言人毛宁谈到能源部的结论时说。随后，她再次提及实验室泄漏论，呼吁美国""停止抹黑中国""。"
"China's response adds to the growing friction between Washington and Beijing this month, following a spy balloon incident and U.S. accusations that China was considering supplying Russia with weapons and ammunition for use in Ukraine.",中国的回应加剧了本月华盛顿和北京之间的摩擦，此前发生了间谍气球事件，以及美国指责中国正在考虑向俄罗斯提供武器弹药用于乌克兰战争。
"It also comes at a time when lawmakers in Washington are increasing their scrutiny of China with a new House select committee on competition with China. In addition, a hearing is set for Tuesday in the House Foreign Affairs Committee over how to counter the Chinese Communist Party's ""aggression.""","与此同时，华盛顿的立法者加强了对中国的审查，众议院新成立了一个与中国竞争委员会。此外，众议院外交事务委员会定于周二就如何反击中共的""攻击性""举行听证会。"
"The debate over where the coronavirus emerged from remains highly divisive, fueled in part by distrust over the Chinese government and its lack of transparency as well as by anti-Chinese rhetoric and conspiracy theories fanned by the Trump administration. China has also spread conspiracy theories by suggesting Covid may have been a product of U.S. biological weapons programs.",关于新冠病毒起源的争论仍然存在高度分歧，对中国政府的不信任、中国政府缺乏透明度，以及特朗普政府煽动的反华言论和阴谋论均为原因之一。中国也在散布阴谋论，暗示新冠病毒可能是美国生物武器计划的产物。
"Some scientists say the most compelling evidence available today supports the most prevalent theory, that the virus came from live animals stored at a large market in Wuhan, China. No evidence has emerged directly linking the pandemic to a lab.",一些科学家表示，目前最流行的理论拥有最有说服力的证据支持，即该病毒来自中国武汉一个大型市场的活体动物。没有证据表明大流行与实验室直接相关。
"However, suspicions persist about a lab leak because of two research facilities in Wuhan that have handled highly infectious diseases: the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan C.D.C. lab.",然而，由于武汉有两个曾处理高度传染性疾病的研究机构，人们仍然怀疑存在实验室泄漏的可能。这两个研究机构分别是武汉病毒研究所和武汉疾控中心实验室。
"Some scientists say the Wuhan Institute of Virology conducted risky experiments. Shi Zhengli, the head of the lab and a top Chinese virologist, dismissed the claims of a leak in a brief interview with The Times in 2021.",一些科学家称，武汉病毒研究所进行了危险的实验。实验室负责人、中国顶级病毒学家石正丽在2021年接受《纽约时报》的简短采访时驳斥了泄漏的说法。
"""How on earth can I offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?"" she said.","""凭什么他没有证据的事情，我怎么去给他提供证据呢?""她说。"
"China has repeatedly dismissed the lab leak theory as politically motivated misinformation designed to smear China. It says the theory has no basis in scientific fact and points to a World Health Organization report released in 2021 that determined that it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the pandemic emerged accidentally from a Chinese laboratory.","中国多次驳斥实验室泄漏论，说这是出于政治动机的虚假信息，旨在抹黑中国。中国表示该理论没有科学事实依据，并指出世界卫生组织2021年发布的一份报告确定，这种流行病""极不可能""是从中国实验室意外出现的。"
"The report, which set out to investigate the origins of the coronavirus, has been the subject of much debate because China is believed to have heavily influenced its findings by appointing half of the scientists involved in the project.",这份旨在调查新冠病毒起源的报告一直备受争议，据信中国对调查结果产生了重大影响，因为参与该项目的半数科学家都由中国指派。
"Faced with widespread criticism for not doing more to prevent the pandemic, China has also sought to deflect blame by spreading a conspiracy theory that the virus may have been the result of research at a U.S. military lab in Fort Detrick, Md. The claim, which was first made in March 2020, was repeated by a foreign ministry spokesman as recently as earlier this month.",面对没有采取更多措施预防大流行的广泛批评，中国还试图通过传播阴谋论来转移责任，即该病毒可能是马里兰州德特里克堡的美国军事实验室研究的产物。这一言论在2020年3月首次发布，最近在本月早些时候被外交部发言人再次提及。
"At the Energy Department, new intelligence prompted it to change its position from being undecided about how the virus emerged. Officials did not share that intelligence, but said the agency made its conclusion with only ""low confidence.""","在能源部，新的情报促使它改变了在病毒溯源上原本尚未决定的立场。官员们没有透露情报细节，但表示该机构以""低置信度""得出该结论。"
"U.S. spy agencies are not in agreement about the origins of the virus. The F.B.I. has concluded with moderate confidence that the virus traces back to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, whereas four other U.S. intelligence agencies and the National Intelligence Council have concluded with low confidence that Covid most likely emerged through natural transmission, the director of national intelligence's office announced in October 2021.","美国间谍机构对病毒的来源意见不一。FBI得出结论认为该病毒可追溯到武汉病毒研究所，而国家情报总监办公室2021年10月宣布，其他四个美国情报机构和国家情报委员会以""低置信度""得出结论，认为新冠病毒很可能是通过自然传播出现的。"
"In China, a country that limits most couples to three children, one province is making a bold pitch to try to get its citizens to procreate: have as many babies as you want, even if you are unmarried.",在大多数夫妇最多只能生三个孩子的中国，有一个省份正在迈出大胆的一步，试图促进国民的生育:想生几个都行，即便没有结婚。
"The initiative, which came into effect this month, points to the renewed urgency of China's efforts tospark a baby boom after its population shrank last year for the first time since a national famine in the 1960s. Other efforts are underway officials in several cities have urged college students to donate sperm to help spur population growth, and there are plans to expand national insurance coverage for fertility treatments, including I.V.F.",这一措施本月生效，它说明了在去年出现自1960年代全国大饥荒以来的首次人口萎缩后，中国正加紧努力推动一场婴儿潮。此外还有一些措施正在进行——多个城市的官员呼吁大学生捐献精子以刺激人口增长，另外正在考虑扩大国家保险覆盖，以纳入包括体外人工受精在内的生育治疗。
"But the measures have been met with a wave of public skepticism, ridicule and debate, highlighting the challenges China faces as it seeks to stave off a shrinking work force that could imperil economic growth.",然而这些措施引发了公众的大量质疑、嘲弄和辩论，凸显了中国在应对可能危及经济增长的劳动力萎缩时遇到的困难。
"Many young Chinese adults, who themselves were born during China's draconian one-child policy, are pushing back on the government's inducements to have babies in a country that is among the most expensive in the world to raise a child. To them, such incentives do little to address anxieties about supporting their aging parents and managing the rising costs of education, housing and health care.",许多年轻的中国成年人是在该国严厉的独生子女政策下出生的，他们中的许多人拒绝接受政府的诱导，不想在这个养育子女成本在世界上属于前列的国家生育。在他们看来，这些刺激政策没有解决他们在赡养年迈的父母、应对日益增加的教育、住房和医疗成本方面的焦虑。
"""The fundamental problem is not that people cannot have children, but that they cannot afford it,"" said Lu Yi, a 26-year-old nurse in Sichuan, the province that recently lifted birth limits. She added that she would need to earn at least double her current monthly salary of 8,000 yuan, or about $1,200, to even consider having children.","""根本问题不是人们不想要孩子，而是要不起孩子，""现年26岁、在近日取消生育限制的四川省做护士的卢怡(音)说。她还说她至少需要让现在的8000元月薪翻一番，否则根本不能奢谈要孩子。"
"Many countries around the world from Japan to Russia to Sweden have confronted the same demographic challenge, and their attempts to incentivize new babies with subsidies and other tactics have had a limited impact. But China has aged faster than other countries. The often harshly enforced one-child policy, which was aimed at slowing population growth, precipitated the steep decline in births and led to a generational shift in attitudes around family sizes.",全世界许多国家——从日本到俄罗斯再到瑞典——都在面临同样的人口问题，他们试图用补贴等手段刺激生育，但效果并不明显。然而中国的人口老化速度格外快。时常使用严厉手段执行的独生子女政策原本旨在减缓人口增长，结果导致出生率急剧下跌，在有关家庭规模的观念上形成一次代际转变。
"Efforts by the ruling Communist Party to raise fertility rates by permitting all couples to have two children in 2016, then three in 2021 have struggled to gain traction. The new policy in Sichuan drew widespread attention because it essentially disregards birth limits altogether, showing how the demographic crisis is nudging the party to slowly relinquish its iron grip over the reproductive rights of its citizens.",执政的中国共产党努力提升生育率——2016年开始允许所有夫妇生育二胎，2021年又改为允许三胎——但收效甚微。四川的新政引起广泛关注，因为此举实际上彻底无视了生育限制，表明人口危机正在逼迫中共慢慢废除其对国民生育权的铁腕控制。
"""The two-child policy failed. The three-child policy failed,"" said Yi Fuxian, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has studied Chinese population trends. ""This is the natural next step.""","""二胎政策失败了。三胎政策失败了，""研究中国人口趋势的威斯康辛大学麦迪逊分校研究员易富贤说。""这自然就成了下一步。"""
"Sichuan, the country's fifth-largest province with 84 million people, lifted all limits on the number of children that residents can register with the local government, a process that qualifies parents for paid parental leave and reimbursed hospital bills. In an unusual move, it also included parents who are unmarried. Previously only married couples were allowed to register children (and only up to three).",人口为8400万、在全国列第五的四川取消了居民可登记子女的数量限制，一旦得到登记，父母就有资格申请带薪产假并报销医药费。不同寻常的是，这一政策还包括了未婚父母。此前只有已婚夫妇可以登记子女(最多为三个子女)。
"The new policy touched a nerve in a country where single mothers have long faced discrimination. In online forums, some commenters praised it as a long-overdue step to protect unmarried mothers. Others bemoaned that it would incentivize men to have babies with their mistresses, criticizing the policy for bringing ""illegitimate children"" out of the shadows.","在这个单身母亲长期面临歧视的国家，这项新政策触动了人们的神经。在网上论坛，一些评论称赞这是保护未婚母亲的措施，早就应该实行。另一些人则抱怨说，这将鼓励男性和情妇生孩子，批评这项政策让""私生子""可以见光。"
"In most parts of China, single mothers are denied the government benefits offered to married couples. Until recently, some provinces had even imposed fines on unmarried women who gave birth. But the baby shortage has prompted provinces like Sichuan to start legally recognizing children born to single mothers, part of a Communist Party push toward more ""inclusive"" population policies.","在中国大部分地区，单身母亲无法享受已婚夫妇享受的政府福利。直到前不久，一些省份甚至对未婚生育的女性处以罚款。但婴儿短缺已经促使四川等省份开始从法律上承认单身母亲所生的孩子，这是中共推动更""包容""的人口政策的一部分。"
"Women's rights advocates have celebrated this trend as a win for unmarried mothers. Still, Zhang Meng, 47, a single mother in Shanghai, said China has been too slow in expanding the rights of nontraditional families.",女权倡导者将这一趋势视为未婚母亲的胜利。不过，47岁的上海单身母亲张萌(音)说，中国在扩大非传统家庭的权利方面进展太慢。
"Ms. Zhang found out she was pregnant in 2016, soon after breaking up with her boyfriend. She was 40 years old at the time and decided to keep the baby, worried that it might be her only opportunity to have one.",2016年，与男友分手后不久，张萌发现自己怀孕了。她当时40岁，决定留下这个孩子，担心这可能是自己唯一的机会。
"After her son was born, her application for paid maternity leave and medical bill reimbursement which are provided to married couples was rejected.",儿子出生后，她申请带薪产假和报销医疗账单——这些都是提供给已婚夫妇的——结果遭到拒绝。
"She sued local agencies for the money. Years later, in 2021, she finally received 70,000 yuan, about $10,200, from the government. But the obstacles for women like her go far beyond compensation, she said.",她起诉当地机构，要求得到这笔钱。几年后，在2021年，她终于从政府那里收到了70000元人民币。但她说，像她这样的女性面临的障碍远远超过了赔偿。
"""What many women, especially single mothers, lack is not money, but the protection of their rights and the respect of society,"" Ms. Zhang said.","""很多女性，尤其是单身母亲，缺的不是钱，而是权利得不到保护，得不到社会尊重，""张萌说。"
"Women's rights advocates have argued that the government's effort to raise fertility rates risks reinforcing discrimination against women. Already, job listings sometimes explicitly seek only men or women who already have children; when China began allowing couples to have three children, women worried that employers reluctant to pay for maternity leave would be even less willing to hire them.",女性权利倡导者认为，政府提高生育率的努力可能导致女性受到更多歧视。有的招聘广告已经明确只招男性或已生育女性;中国放开二胎和三胎后，女性担心本就不愿负担产假薪水的雇主会更加不愿雇用她们。
"""Until China fundamentally transforms its social institutions and has more gender equality, women can vote with their wombs,"" said Wang Feng, a professor at the University of California at Irvine who specializes in China's demographics.","""在中国从根本上改变其社会制度，实现更多性别平等之前，女性都会用子宫投票，""加州大学尔湾分校专门研究中国人口学的教授王丰说。"
Gender inequality looms over the demographic crisis in other ways.,在人口危机中，性别不平等还以其他形式体现了出来。
"In recent months, as a growing number of cities in China have announced payments for sperm donations, people left comments online joking that men were finally bearing a fraction of the pressure that women have faced to alleviate the country's fertility decline.",近几个月来，随着中国越来越多的城市开始号召有偿捐精，人们在网上开玩笑说，男性终于感受到了一丝女性在解决全国生育率下滑的问题上所面临的压力。
"This month, a hospital in Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan in southwest China, announced that college students but only those taller than 5-foot-5 who donated their sperm could receive 4,500 yuan, or about $660. Sounding like a collective call to action, the announcement concluded with a slogan in pink font: ""I donate sperm. I am outstanding. I am proud.""","本月，云南省省会昆明市一家医院宣布，捐献精子的大学生——但仅限身高1米65以上——可以获得4500元补贴。这听起来像是集体行动的号召，公告结尾还用粉色字体写着:""我捐精，我优秀，我自豪。"""
"Along with building up sperm banks, officials are also doing more to expand access to treatments like in vitro fertilization. Yet experts have noted that declining birthrates are related more to economic and cultural shifts than to infertility.",除了建立精子库，官员还着手进行了扩大体外受精等治疗医保覆盖面等工作。但专家指出，出生率下降更多与经济和文化转变有关，而非不孕不育。
"In the aftermath of the country's Covid-19 lockdowns, nearly one in five Chinese people between the ages of 16 and 24 are unemployed, compounding the disillusionment of a generation in which many see the refusal to have children as an act of political resistance.",在中国结束新冠封控措施后，16岁至24岁的中国人有近五分之一失业，加剧了这一代人的幻灭感，其中许多人将拒绝生育视为一种政治抗争。
"In a survey last year of about 20,000 younger Chinese people, mostly from 18 to 25, two-thirds of respondents said they did not want to have children. Demographers cite the costs and pressures of the Chinese educational system as a major concern, recommending policy solutions like shortening schooling by two years and eliminating the competitive exam for entrance to high school.",去年一项针对约20000名中国年轻人(大多年龄在18岁到25岁之间)的调查显示，三分之二的受访者都说自己不想要孩子。人口统计学家认为，中国教育体系的成本和压力是主要因素，他们提出了一些政策解决方案，如将学制缩短两年，以及取消竞争激烈的高中入学考试。
"For now, many cities in China are trying to address the financial pressures of parenting with direct cash payments.",目前，中国许多城市正试图通过直接发放现金补贴来解决育儿经济压力。
"Last month, Shenzhen, a large city bordering Hong Kong, announced a proposal to provide 7,500 yuan, or about $1,100, to households who have one child with additional payments for each sibling.",上个月，毗邻香港的大城市深圳公布了一项拟案，计划向一孩家庭发放7500元补贴，每多生一胎补贴也会相应增加。
"Tracy Chen, 36, a lawyer in Shenzhen who recently got married, said the subsidy would barely cover one month of a live-in nanny.",36岁的深圳律师特蕾西·陈(音)最近结婚，她说这些补贴勉强够支付住家保姆一个月的工资。
Ms. Chen said she initially wanted three children because she liked the idea of growing old with a large and lively family.,特蕾西·陈说她一开始想生三胎，因为渴望在一个热闹的大家庭里养老。
"But seeing her older sister and friends navigate the expense of raising even one child opened her eyes. Many of Ms. Chen's friends lived in expensive hotels during a postpartum confinement commonly practiced in China, known as ""zuo yuezi."" And they paid extra for foreign-made baby formula, still distrustful of domestic brands after a tainted formula scandal in 2008 sickened thousands of babies in China.",但当目睹了姐姐和朋友们如何负担一个孩子的养育成本，她惊讶不已。特蕾西·陈的许多朋友在坐月子期间都住在昂贵的月子中心。他们还得购买更贵的外国配方奶粉，因为2008年导致无数中国婴儿患病的配方奶粉丑闻让他们仍然不信任国产品牌。
"Ms. Chen is thinking of trying for one child for now. She said the subsidy was a nice perk but that ""it's not enough to influence whether you will have a child or not.""","特蕾西·陈目前只考虑要一个孩子。她说补贴是不错的福利，但""还不足以动摇是否生育的决定""。"
"The Hong Kong police have detained four people in connection with the killing of a model and influencer, in a case that has horrified the city.",香港警方逮捕了与一名网红模特凶杀案相关的四人，这起案件震惊全港。
"The victim, Abby Choi, 28, had appeared in the pages of fashion magazines and enjoyed a wide following on social media, where she posted images of herself attending fashion events around the world dressed in couture. A young mother, she had divorced and remarried; her ex-husband, along with his parents and brother, are suspects in her death.",死者是28岁的蔡天凤，曾登上时尚杂志，经常在社交媒体晒出穿着高定时装满世界出席时尚活动的照片，收获大量粉丝。她也是一个年轻的妈妈，曾经离异，已经再婚;她的前夫连同前夫父母与哥哥都成为谋杀她的嫌疑人。
"Ms. Choi was reported missing early Wednesday. Superintendent Alan Chung of the Hong Kong Police Department, who is leading the investigation, said that on Friday officers had discovered her partial, dismembered remains, along with a meat grinder and an electric saw, in a seaside residence that the father of Ms. Choi's ex-husband had begun renting this month in Lung Mei Village.",周三早些时候，蔡天凤被报失踪。负责此案调查的香港警务处警司钟雅伦表示，警方上周五在一处海滨村屋发现了她遭肢解的残骸，还有一台绞肉机和一把电锯。蔡天凤前夫的父亲本月租下了龙尾村这处村屋。
"Mr. Chung, in a news conference on Saturday, said that Ms. Choi had had disputes with members of her ex-husband's family over the handling of finances, and that those relatives had given the police misleading information that had slowed the investigation. Ms. Choi's former father-in-law and brother-in-law, who worked as Ms. Choi's chauffeur, were arrested on Friday and charged with murder on Sunday.",钟雅伦在周六的新闻发布会上表示，蔡天凤与前夫家人在财务问题上发生纠纷，而前夫家人向警方提供了误导性信息，阻碍了调查进展。蔡天凤前夫的父亲和担任她私人司机的哥哥于周五被捕，并在周日被控谋杀。
Ms. Choi's former mother-in-law was charged with perverting the course of justice.,蔡天凤前夫的母亲被控妨碍司法公正。
"On Saturday, officers intercepted Ms. Choi's ex-husband whom the police identified only by his family name, Kwong at a ferry pier.",周六，警方在渡轮码头围捕蔡天凤前夫，仅透露他姓邝。

"Mr. Kwong, 28, is currently being questioned, he said.",他表示，现年28岁的邝某目前正在接受审讯。
"The police also began a sweeping search on Saturday for the rest of Ms. Choi's remains in a hillside cemetery that her former father-in-law and brother-in-law had visited after she had been reported missing. More than 100 people were deployed, including divers who went into a drainage ditch near the cemetery. The effort continued on Sunday.",周六，警方开始在位于山坡上的一处公墓搜寻蔡天凤残骸，她前夫的父亲和哥哥在她被报失踪后曾前往此处。警方部署了100多名警力，包括派潜水员潜入墓地附近的储水池。周日，搜寻工作仍在继续。
"Ms. Choi prided herself in her sartorial taste. When she was the digital cover model for L'Officiel Monaco, a fashion magazine, two weeks ago, she wrote on Instagram: ""My journey as a style icon continues.""","蔡天凤对自己的时尚品味非常自信。两周前，当她登上时尚杂志《L'Officiel Monaco》数字版的封面时，她在Instagram上写道:""我的时尚偶像之路仍在继续。"""
"""I am a person who keeps absorbing inspiration and always tries new styles,"" she said in an interview with the magazine. ""Sometimes I also try to dress up more extravagant, by mixing and combining different looks.""","""我喜欢不断吸收灵感，不断尝试新风格，""她在接受该杂志访问时表示。""有时候我会把自己打扮得更浮夸，把不同风格的造型混搭在一起。"""
"Ms. Choi's children with her ex-husband are now in the care of her mother, according to the police.",警方表示，蔡天凤与前夫的子女现由她的母亲照顾。
"After a drumroll of diplomatic activity suggesting that China was poised to play a more energetic role in seeking peace in Ukraine, Beijing issued a paper on Friday that reprised its established views on the war, calling for an end to fighting while avoiding demands or words like ""invasion"" that could hurt its ties with Russia.","在进行了一连串外交活动，暗示中国已准备在结束乌克兰战争上发挥更积极作用之后，北京上周五发布的文件重申了中国政府对这场战争的既定立场，呼吁停止战火，同时避免提出可能会损害中俄关系的要求，而且没有使用""入侵""等字眼。"
"The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the paper on thefirst anniversary of Russia's invasion and after China's most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, visited Europe, telling a security forum in Munich that the document would lay out China's positions for a ""political settlement"" of the crisis. But the document was not the blueprint or bold initiative that some in European capitals appeared to expect, instead repeating Beijing's standard talking points of the last year.","俄罗斯入侵乌克兰一周年之际，在中国最高级别外交官王毅访问了欧洲之后，中国外交部发布了这份文件。虽然王毅曾在慕尼黑安全论坛上表示，这份文件将阐明中国对""政治解决""这场危机的立场，但文件中并没有一些欧洲国家政府似乎期待的蓝图或大胆倡议，而是重复了中国政府去年的标准讲话要点。"
"While China has sought to portray itself as a neutral broker over the last year, it has also in some important ways aligned itself with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Though China has generally refrained from giving weapons and similar material aid to Russia, it has given Mr. Putin diplomatic support in international venues, defended its economic ties with Russia and officially promoted Kremlin disinformation on the war.",尽管中国在过去一年里一直努力将自己描绘成一个中立的调停人，但也在一些重要方面与俄罗斯总统普京保持一致。虽然中国大体上避免向俄罗斯提供武器以及类似的物资帮助，但在国际场合一直给予普京外交支持，维护与俄罗斯的经济关系，还通过官媒宣传克里姆林宫关于这场战争的虚假信息。
"Beijing's diplomatic paper, titled ""China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis,"" called for an end to the fighting and a start to peace negotiations, but only in broad terms.",北京发布的题为《关于政治解决乌克兰危机的中国立场》的文件，呼吁停止战火，启动和平谈判，但文件措辞笼统。
"""The sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be effectively upheld,"" reads the first of the 12 points given in the paper. It does not explain how Beijing believes that principle should apply to Russia's claims to Ukrainian territory or to Ukraine's demand that Russian forces leave.","""各国主权、独立和领土完整都应该得到切实保障，""文件列出的12条立场的第一条写道。文件没有解释北京如何看待该原则如何适用于俄罗斯对乌克兰领土的主权主张，或乌克兰提出的俄罗斯军队撤离乌克兰的要求。"
"The paper also said ""nuclear weapons must not be used"" and called for civilians to be ""effectively"" protected.","文件还说""核武器用不得""，并呼吁""切实保护平民安全""。"
"""Humanitarian corridors should be set up for the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones,"" it said.","""为平民撤离交战区建立人道主义走廊，""文件写道。"
"Mr. Wang, the senior Chinese diplomat, laid out similar principles last year, not long after Russian forces rushed toward Ukraine's capital.",去年，在俄罗斯军队向乌克兰首都发动进攻后不久，时任中国外交部长的王毅曾阐述过类似的原则。
"European leaders, who had wanted China's leader, Xi Jinping, to do more to rein in Mr. Putin, effectively dismissed the Chinese paper on Friday on the basis of Beijing's continued friendly relations with the Kremlin. Both the NATO secretary general and the European Commission president alluded to a declaration, made about three weeks before the invasion by Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi, that Moscow and Beijing had a ""no limits"" friendship.","上周五，曾希望中国领导人习近平在遏制普京方面做出更多的欧洲领导人对这份文件的反应非常冷淡，因为北京继续与克里姆林宫保持友好关系。北约秘书长和欧盟委员会主席都间接提到在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的大约三周前，普京和习近平曾发表联合声明称中俄友谊""无止境""。"
"""China doesn't have much credibility, because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine"" while promising an enduring friendship with Russia, Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said at a news conference in Tallinn, Estonia.","""中国没有多少可信度，因为他们(在承诺与俄罗斯保持持久友谊的同时)一直没能谴责俄罗斯对乌克兰的非法入侵""，北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格在爱沙尼亚塔林的记者会上说。"
"In recent days, U.S. officials have warned that Beijing may be preparing to give weapons and ammunition to Russia, which would be a major shift for China. In response, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused the United States of spreading lies.",美国官员在近日警告，中国政府也许正在准备向俄罗斯提供武器和弹药，这会是中国立场的一个重大转变。中国外交部对这个警告的反应是指责美国散布谎言。
"Mr. Stoltenberg said on Friday that despite ""signs and indications"" that China may be considering giving military aid to Russia, NATO had ""not seen any actual delivery of lethal aid.""","斯托尔滕贝格上周五说，尽管有""迹象和征兆""表明，中国也许正在考虑向俄罗斯提供军事援助，但北约""尚未看到任何致命性援助的实际交付""。"
"China's proposals must be seen ""against a specific backdrop,"" Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said at the news conference, ""and that is the backdrop that China has already taken sides by signing, for example, an unlimited friendship right before the invasion.""","必须""在一个特定背景下""看待中国立场，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩在记者会上说，""那就是，中国早已选边站队，比如就在入侵前不久签署了无止境友好关系。"""
"Given Russia's aggression in Ukraine, she said, ""now is the time to double down we must keep giving Ukraine the means to defend itself until the Russians end this war and leave Ukraine.""","她说，鉴于是俄罗斯入侵了乌克兰，""现在是加倍努力的时候，我们必须继续为乌克兰提供自卫手段，直到俄罗斯人停止这场战争，离开乌克兰。"""
"The top U.S. diplomat, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, said on Friday that ""any proposal that can advance peace is something that's worth looking at.""","美国最高外交官、国务卿布林肯上周五表示，""任何能够促进和平的提议都值得一看。"""
"But, like his European counterparts, he expressed skepticism about the Chinese position. Speaking in an interview with ""Good Morning America"" on Friday, he said: ""China's been trying to have it both ways. It's on the one hand trying to present itself publicly as neutral and seeking peace, while at the same time it was talking up Russia's false narrative about the war.""","但他和欧洲外交高官们一样对中国立场表示怀疑。上周五，他在接受""早安美国""的采访时说:""中国一直在试图两全其美。一方面试图在公开场合表明自己中立和寻求和平的立场，但同时又在宣传中大谈俄罗斯对这场战争的虚假叙事。"""
"Mr. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has created predicaments for China ever since he sent troops en masse across the Ukrainian border. Chinese leaders see Russia as a vital counterweight to American power, even if they may quietly wish that Mr. Putin would pull back from military belligerence.",自从普京大举出兵越过乌克兰边境以来，俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵一直让中国处于尴尬境地。中国领导人将俄罗斯视为制约美国力量的重要抗衡，尽管他们可能私下里希望普京撤回在军事上挑衅西方的做法。
"When Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi met in Beijing before the invasion, they celebrated their close ties amid the fanfare of the Olympic Games. In a joint statement at that summit, Mr. Xi also endorsed Russian opposition to the possibility that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would expand farther into Eastern Europe, including by implication into Ukraine.",在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前，普京和习近平曾在冬奥会的喧嚣中在北京举行会晤，庆祝中俄亲密关系。在那次峰会后发表的联合声明中，习近平还支持俄罗斯反对北约可能东扩的立场，包括乌克兰加入北约。
"After the opening weeks of the invasion, China sought to show that it was seeking peace in Ukraine and felt pained by the carnage and destruction there. Even so, Mr. Xi and Chinese diplomats have continued to praise their broader relationship with Russia and have largely avoided calling Mr. Putin's actions an invasion or war.",在俄罗斯入侵的最初几周里，中国曾试图表示它正在寻求乌克兰的和平，并对那里的屠杀和破坏感到痛苦。尽管如此，习近平和中国外交官们继续称赞中国与俄罗斯的更广泛关系，并在很大程度上避免将普京的行为称为入侵或战争。
"On Thursday, when the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling for a peace agreement that guarantees Ukraine's sovereignty, China abstained.","上周四，联合国大会以压倒性多数通过了决议，呼吁尽快在乌克兰实现""全面、公正和持久的和平""，中国投了弃权票。"
"The new position paper sticks to that stance and euphemistic wording, and itsuggests some continued sympathy with Mr. Putin's underlying grievances with the United States and its allies. Countries should abandon a ""Cold War mentality,"" the paper says, a criticism that Beijing largely directs at Washington. It also restates Chinese opposition to economic sanctions that have largely cut Russia off from Western markets and goods.","中国发布的新立场坚持了以前的立场和委婉措辞，暗示中国仍在一定程度上同情普京对美国及其盟友的根本不满。立场文件称，各国应摒弃""冷战思维""，这主要是在批评华盛顿。文件还重申中国反对经济制裁，这些制裁已在很大程度上切断了俄罗斯与西方市场和商品的联系。"
"""Unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure cannot solve the issue; they only create new problems,"" the paper says.","""单边制裁、极限施压不仅解决不了问题，而且会制造出新的问题，""该文件写道。"
"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has not shied from countries aligned with Russia or even supporters who he feels could do more to help, has walked carefully around China. ""I really want to believe that China is not going to supply weapons to Russia,"" he said at a news conference on Friday, calling the prevention of such action a major priority for Ukraine. ""I want to believe China is going to side with the idea of peace and fairness.""","虽然乌克兰总统泽伦斯基不回避批评那些与俄罗斯结盟的国家，甚至是那些他认为还可以提供更多帮助的支持者，但泽伦斯基小心翼翼地避开直接评论中国。""我真的想相信中国不会向俄罗斯提供武器，""他在上周五的记者会上说，并说防止出现这种情况是乌克兰的一个主要优先事项。""我想相信中国会站在和平与公平的里面一边。"""
"He was similarly cautious in remarks about China's diplomatic proposal, saying, ""I think that China spoke its mind about the matter.""","他对于中国的外交建议也表示了同样的谨慎态度，他说，""我认为中国已经在这个问题上表达了自己的看法""。"
"Rescuers in northern China were working on Thursday to save 53 coal miners who were missing after the collapse of an open-pit mine. At least four deaths had been confirmed, local officials and state media said.",周四在中国北部地区，救援人员正在努力营救一座露天煤矿坍塌后失踪的53名煤矿工人。当地官员和官方媒体称，已确认至少有四人死亡。(编注:据央视新闻最新消息，截至23日22:30，死亡人数已上升至六人。)
"Footage released by CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, showed what appeared to be the moment of the collapse on Wednesday afternoon. As a stream of workers, seen from a distance, are wending through a narrow basin, a landslide occurs, blanketing the area with rock and sand and obscuring the miners from view.",中国国家电视台中央电视台发布的画面显示了煤矿在周三下午倒塌的瞬间。从远处看，一队工人正穿过一个狭窄的盆地时发生了滑坡，岩石和沙子将那里掩埋，矿工失去了踪影。
"More than 500 emergency personnel were at the mine in Alxa League, a prefecture in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, by late Wednesday night, state media said. Live coverage on CCTV showed a fleet of trucks taking rescue equipment and food to the site, and workers putting up tents.",官方媒体称，截至周三深夜，已有500多名应急人员到达位于中国内蒙古自治区阿拉善盟的矿区。中央电视台的现场报道显示，一队卡车将救援设备和食物运往现场，工人搭起了帐篷。
"Wei Zhiguo, one of the leaders of the rescue effort, told CCTV that there had been a second landslide while emergency personnel were on the scene. ""The rescue work is still being carried out in a very intense and orderly manner,"" he said.","救援工作负责人之一魏治国告诉中央电视台，在救援人员赶到现场时，发生了第二次山体滑坡。""救援工作还是在非常紧张、有序地展开，""他说。"
"Six people had been rescued as of Thursday, CCTV reported. Among them was Ma Jianping, who was interviewed by the state broadcaster from a hospital bed. He said he had noticed ""gravel falling from the mountain"" as he began the day's work.","据中央电视台报道，截至周四，已有六人获救。其中包括在病床上接受央视采访的马建平。他说，他上班后注意到""山上往下掉石渣""。"

"Hundreds of people die in coal mining accidents in China every year, though the industry's safety record has improved considerably. Last year, the death toll from such accidents was about 240, down from over 2,600 in 2009, according to data from government agencies. Most of the deaths have been attributed to failure to follow safety protocols, including ventilation requirements.",中国每年有数百人死于煤矿事故，尽管该行业的安全记录已大大改善。根据政府机构的数据，去年此类事故造成的死亡人数约为240人，低于2009年的2600多人。大多数死亡归因于未能遵守安全规程，包括通风要求。
"In 2020, at least 16 people died of carbon monoxide poisoning after being trapped in a coal mine in the southwestern city of Chongqing. At least 23 were killed at another mine in the same city a few months later.",2020年，至少有16人被困在西南部城市重庆的一个煤矿后死于一氧化碳中毒。几个月后，在同一城市的另一座煤矿，至少有23人遇难。
"Inner Mongolia has long been a key area for coal mining in China. In 2021, to stave off an energy shortage, the central government ordered more than 70 mines in the region to ramp up production, though Chinese leaders committed to phase out coal at a climate summit in Glasgow shortly thereafter. As of 2021, coal accounted for about 56 percent of China's energy consumption, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.",长期以来，内蒙古一直是中国煤炭的主要产区。2021年，为避免能源短缺，中央政府下令该地区的70多个煤矿释放产能，尽管中国领导人此后不久在格拉斯哥举行的气候峰会上承诺逐步淘汰煤炭。根据国家统计局的数据，截至2021年，煤炭约占中国能源消费的56%。
"Inner Mongolia Xinjing Coal Industry, which operates the coal mine, was incorporated in 1999, according to a Chinese business data platform, Qichacha. No major accidents are known to have occurred at the mine before. Attempts to reach the company by telephone were not immediately successful.",根据中国商业数据平台企查查，经营该煤矿的内蒙古新井煤业成立于1999年。据了解，该矿以前没有发生过重大事故。记者尚无法立即通过电话联系到该公司。
"Local governments across China, facing a financial tipping point after three years of expensive Covid measures, are forcing abrupt changes on the country's health care system, squeezing benefits and angering citizens.","实行了三年代价高昂的新冠""清零""政策后，中国的地方政府面临财政危机，被迫突然修改国家的医保制度，消减公民享有的福利，引起了民众的愤怒。"
"Thousands of seniors, who are most vulnerable to the cutbacks, converged on municipal parks and other public spaces in recent days to protest the changes. They gathered in the chilly northeastern city of Dalian, in semitropical Guangzhou nearly 1,500 miles away and in Wuhan in central China, where the Covid pandemic began at the end of 2019.",最近几天，数以千计的老年人聚集在各地的公园和其他公共场所抗议这些改革措施，他们是受影响最大的群体。从寒冷的东北城市大连，到与大连相距2400公里的亚热带城市广州，再到新冠病毒大流行于2019年底开始的地方——中部城市武汉，都出现了抗议集会。
"One of the most immediate problems is that municipal insurance funds that pay for many people's hospital care are running out of money. The funds, supported by taxes on employers, face big deficits that city governments are required by law to top up.",最紧迫的问题之一是，覆盖许多人住院治疗费用的政府医保基金已经花光。这些基金来自对雇主的征税，如今正面临着巨额赤字，按照法律要求，地方政府需要弥补这些赤字。
"To free up money to bail out hospitals, municipalities have started contributing much less to another important category of insurance, known as personal health accounts, which the middle class uses to pay for medicine and outpatient care.",为了腾出钱来帮助医院度过困境，市政当局已开始减少对医保个人账户的投入。中产阶级用个人账户来支付医药费和门诊费。
"While public opposition to the changes has not reached the scale of demonstrations in late November against ""zero Covid,"" the strict policy of mass testing and lockdowns that was reversed in early December, they underscore the disillusionment among many Chinese. Benefits promised to seniors when the economy was growing fast are becoming more precarious.","虽然公众对这些变化的反对还没有达到去年11月下旬反对新冠""清零""的示威活动的规模(政府已在去年12月初取消了大规模核酸检测和封控的严格政策)，但它们凸显了许多中国人的幻灭感。经济快速增长时向老年人承诺的福利正变得越来越不可靠。"
"""The personal account is our own money,"" Chen Guangyao, 59, a retiree from a state-owned factory in Wuhan, said last week. He didn't join protesters on Feb. 15 and 16, but said he shared their anger.","""个人账户就是我们自己的钱，""现年59岁的陈广遥(音)上周说，他是武汉一家国企的退休职工。他没有参加2月15日和16日抗议活动，但他说，他和那些参加抗议的人一样愤怒。"
"""The government can't take money from other people's pockets through medical reform, which is encroaching on the interests of the people,"" he said, pausing from practicing his saxophone in a park.","""你不能通过医改，你不能想着这个心思上，把人家钱拿了，绝对不行，侵占了人民的利益，""正在一个公园里练习萨克斯的陈广遥停下来说道。"
"Each city government is taking a slightly different approach to finding savings on health insurance. In Wuhan, the authorities are trying to soften the blow from big cuts in personal health accounts by adding some outpatient coverage and medicine purchases to hospitalization plans.",为节省医保费用，各地政府采取的做法略有不同。武汉当局正试图通过把更多医疗机构和药店纳入职工医保门诊统筹结算范围，来减轻个人账户大幅削减带来的冲击。
"The furor over health insurance highlights a broader fiscal crunch in China's localities, which often bear the brunt of paying for policies handed down from Beijing, such as ""zero Covid.""","对医保改革的愤怒凸显出中国地方政府普遍存在财政紧缩的状况。在执行北京下达的政策时(比如""清零""政策)，地方政府往往是承担代价的一方。"
"On top of bearing extra costs during the pandemic, local governments face growing health care needs for a rapidly rising number of retirees. Yet the main source of municipal revenue has shriveled as real estate developers buy less public land because of a housing shakeout long in the making.","除了在疫情期间承担""清零""的额外代价外，地方政府还面临着人数迅速增长的退休人员越来越多的医保需求。然而，地方政府的主要财政来源已经萎缩，因为已经持续了一段时间的房地产市场震荡，导致房地产开发商减少了购买公共土地。"
"Some civil servants and teachers are being paid late or getting pay cuts. Entities affiliated with local governments are missing loan payments or trying to reschedule their debts, which could force losses on banks and other lenders.",一些公务员和教师被拖欠工资或减薪。与地方政府有关联的实体已出现拖欠还贷或试图重组债务的情况，这可能会迫使银行和其他贷款方蒙受损失。
But the changes to health insurance are being felt in an acutely personal way.,但是，医保的变化让人们有了非常切身的感受。
"Three-quarters of China's population of 1.4 billion farmers, migrant workers and others in low-wage occupations as well as children don't have personal health accounts and must rely on bare-bones coverage known as residents insurance.",中国14亿人口中有四分之三的人没有医保个人账户，包括农民、农民工和其他从事低收入职业的人以及儿童，这些人必须依赖被称为居民保险的最基本保障。
"Roughly a quarter of the people have employee hospitalization plans plus personal health accounts, including many current and former employees of state-owned enterprises and better-paid employees and retirees of private companies. Civil servants, who make up only a tiny share of the population, have supplementary insurance in addition to hospital insurance and personal health accounts, said Xian Huang, an associate professor of political science at Rutgers University who studies China's health care system.",在中国，大约四分之一的人口拥有医保统筹基金和个人账户，其中包括许多国企的在职员工和退休员工，以及民营企业薪酬较高的员工和退休人员。公务员只占人口的很小一部分，除了医院保险和医保个人账户外，他们还有补充保险，罗格斯大学研究中国医保制度的政治学副教授黄宪(音)说。
"Holders of personal health accounts who are not part of the civil service the people protesting now ""are not the most privileged group, but they are still a privileged group,"" Professor Huang said.","不属于公务员队伍的个人账户持有者，也就是现在正在发起抗议的群体""不是最有特权的群体，但仍是特权群体""，黄宪说。"
"During the pandemic, the national government allowed many businesses to reduce their mandatory contributions to the health insurance funds for employees that pay hospitalization costs. Lower contributions from businesses coincided with higher costs at hospitals because of Covid.",疫情期间，中央政府允许很多企业减少对员工医保统筹基金的缴款，这个强制性缴纳的健康保险基金是用来支付住院费用的。在企业减少缴纳保险基金的同时，新冠病毒大流行导致住院费用的增加。
It is no accident that the biggest protests have been in Wuhan.,最大规模的抗议活动发生在武汉并非偶然。
"In January 2020, the city's hospitals responded to the first Covid outbreak with a successful but extremely expensive effort to stamp out the disease by medically isolating and treating thousands of infected people. The national government subsequently announced that it would overhaul hospitalization insurance within three years.",2020年1月，武汉的医院对新冠疫情第一波数以千计的感染者进行了医学隔离和治疗，这种做法虽然成功地消除了感染，但成本极其高昂。中央政府随后宣布将在三年内对住院保险进行全面改革。
Demographic changes in China have complicated the task. The number of births each year has dropped by nearly two-thirds since the late 1980s. Fewer young workers support more and more retirees who require ever more health care.,中国人口结构的变化让这项工作变得复杂。中国现在每天出生的人口比20世纪80年代后期下降了近三分之二。工作年龄的人口越来越少，他们要为越来越多需要更多医疗服务的退休人员贡献医保基金。
Cities are now cutting how much money their hospitalization plans transfer to the personal health accounts of retirees. Wuhan's reduction of transfer amounts by a little more than two-thirds is particularly steep.,中国各地的城市现在正在削减从统筹基金转入退休人员个人医保账户的金额。武汉将转入个人账户的金额减少了三分之二以上，步子迈得尤其大。
Local governments are also introducing or increasing deductibles. Wuhan has begun requiring retirees to pay the first $75 of expenses each year and current workers to pay the first $100.,地方政府也在引入或提高起付线。武汉退休人员的医保起付线是每年500元，在职人员的医保起付线是每年700元。
"The average income for urban retirees is about $6,000 a year, not including personal savings. Rural retirees subsist on much less.",中国城市退休人员的平均年收入约为4万元，不包括个人存款。农村退休人员的生活费要低得多。
Social policy experts have cautiously welcomed the health insurance policy changes.,社会政策专家对医保制度的变化持谨慎欢迎的态度。
"""After years of delay, the government needs to reform a social safety net that is extremely fragmented and unequal, with relatively good benefits for people like those protesting in Wuhan and very sparse benefits for people in the countryside or without formal employment,"" said Mary Gallagher, a professor specializing in China's labor and social issues at the University of Michigan.","""经过多年拖延后，政府需要改革一个极度分散和不平等的社会保障体系。目前的医保为武汉抗议者这样的人提供相对较好的福利，为农民或没有正式职业的人提供的福利非常少，""密歇根大学研究中国劳工和社会问题的教授高敏(Mary Gallagher)说。"
"Yang Qingming, 69, worked as a housemaid and never qualified for employee insurance. Now in retirement in Wuhan, she relies on residents insurance, like three-quarters of China's people. She lives on $300 a month and spends half of it on medicine for high blood pressure and diabetes. Her insurance reimburses her for almost none of the cost of her medicine.",69岁的杨清明(音)当了一辈子保姆，从来没有资格参加职工医保。她退休后住在武汉，她和四分之三没有医保的中国人一样依靠城乡居民基本医疗保险。她每月只有2100元的生活费，其中一半花在治疗高血压和糖尿病上。她的保险几乎不报销她的药费。
"Her recent gallstone surgery cost nearly $1,500, but less than a third of it could be expensed under her insurance plan, she said. She has delayed surgery for colitis, she said, because she does not have the money.",她说，她最近做的胆结石手术花了约一万元，保险仅支付了不到三分之一的费用。她说，因为没有钱，她已经推迟了结肠炎手术。
"""If I don't go for treatment, the pain is unbearable; if I go to see a doctor, I can hardly afford it,"" she said.","""不去治，疼得受不得了;要看病，又看不起，""她说。"
"The new medical insurance system rolled out by Wuhan allows people with employee insurance to use the money from their existing personal accounts to begin paying for the medical care of their parents, spouses or children.",武汉推出的新医保制度允许参保职工用个人账户中现有的钱支付父母、配偶或子女的医疗费用。
"Many older urban Chinese feel that they led difficult lives when they were young and China was poor. Those with employee health insurance contend that they helped build today's relatively prosperous China, and resent being asked to sacrifice money from their personal health accounts.",中国城市的许多老年人认为，他们年轻时生活艰难，因为那时中国很穷。那些拥有职工医疗保险的人认为，他们帮助建设了今天相对繁荣的中国，他们对于牺牲个人账户资金的要求感到不满。
"""The socialist country today was created by us, the older generation,"" said a senior who said he had attendedrecent protests in Wuhan. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid police retaliation.","""因为社会主义国家到今天，是我们老一辈创造的，""一名自称参加了武汉最近的抗议活动的老年人说。为避免遭到警方报复，他不愿透露姓名。"
"Some in China favor raising taxes to pay for more social services and stabilize the finances of local governments. China has almost no property taxes, except for nominal sums collected in several cities, including Shanghai. China has no inheritance taxes or taxes on investment gains.",中国有些人赞成提高税收以提供更多的社会福利，稳定地方政府的财政。中国几乎没有财产税，除了在包括上海在内的几个城市收取很少的财产税外。中国也没有遗产税或投资收益税。
"In a speech last month at the National University of Singapore, Lou Jiwei, a former finance minister who still has considerable influence, called for broader experiments with real estate taxes.",上个月，在新加坡国立大学发表讲话时，仍具有相当影响力的中国前财政部长楼继伟呼吁更广泛地展开征收房地产税的试点工作。
"Robin Xing, the chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, said a real estate tax would not raise enough money to bail out the country's local governments. He predicted that these governments would have to sell some of their many assets, like hotels and conference centers.",摩根士丹利首席中国经济学家邢自强表示，征收房地产税无法提供救助中国地方政府所需的足够资金。他预计，地方政府将不得不出售它们众多资产中的一部分，例如酒店和会议中心。
The health insurance difficulties are just the start of a much bigger problem from China's rapid aging.,医保困难只是中国快速老龄化带来的一个更大问题的冰山一角。
"Pensions are also handled by local governments, and government agencies allowed many employers to reduce pension contributions, too, during the pandemic.",养老金也由地方政府负责，政府机构在新冠病毒大流行期间也曾允许许多雇主减少缴纳养老金。
"""Health care is Part 1,"" Mr. Xing said. ""Pensions, when you get more and more people retiring, is Part 2.""","""医保问题是第一章，""邢自强说。""退休的人越来越多时，养老金是第二章。"""
"China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has been on a high-stakes tour of Europe, defending his country's interests in a clash with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and reaffirming Beijing's friendship with Russia with a visit to Moscow.",中国最高外交官王毅正在进行事关重大的欧洲之行。他在捍卫中国利益上与美国国务卿布林肯发生了冲突，之后前往莫斯科重申了中国与俄罗斯的友谊。
But China is also trying to woo European nations in an urgent bid to revive its economy and to find common ground with some of Washington's staunchest allies in the region.,但中国也在试图拉拢欧洲国家，这是为了重振国内经济做出的急迫努力，而且也是为了与华盛顿在欧洲一些最坚定的盟友找到共同点。
"Mr. Wang's travels highlight the conundrum China faces as it tries to enhance its relationship with the European Union, its largest trading partner, without alienating Russia, the only other major power alongside China challenging American global dominance. His trip also has laid bare the constraints of Beijing's balancing act serving as Moscow's strategic lifeline and also professing to be a neutral bystander in a war raging on Western Europe's doorstep.",王毅的出访凸显了中国面临的难题。中国试图在不疏远俄罗斯的情况下加强与其最大贸易伙伴欧盟的关系。俄罗斯是除中国之外唯一一个挑战美国全球主导地位的大国。王毅此行也暴露了北京平衡各方利益行动的局限性，北京要为莫斯科充当战略生命线，同时又声称自己在这场西欧国家大门口的激战中是一个中立的旁观者。
"Mr. Wang promised the leaders of France and Germany that Beijing wanted to ""fully restart exchanges"" and increase cooperation on issues like climate change and free trade. He met with his Ukrainian counterpart, pledging to him that ""China does not want to see the crisis being prolonged and escalated.""","王毅向法国和德国领导人承诺，北京想""全面重启交流""，在气候变化和自由贸易等问题上加强合作。王毅与乌克兰外长见面时向他保证，中国""不愿看到乌克兰危机长期化、扩大化""。"
"After meeting with Mr. Wang in Moscow on Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin's top security aide said Russia backed China on a range of issues.",俄罗斯总统普京的高级安全助理周二在莫斯科与王毅会晤后表示，俄罗斯在一系列问题上支持中国。
"""I want to reaffirm our invariable support for Beijing on the Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong issues, which the West is exploiting to discredit China,"" the aide, Nikolai P. Patrushev, told Mr. Wang, the Interfax news agency reported.","据国际文传电讯社报道，普京的助手尼古拉·帕特鲁舍夫对王毅说，""我想重申我们在台湾、新疆、西藏和香港问题上始终支持北京，西方正在这些问题上抹黑中国。"""
"In a further assertion of the countries' close ties, China's top leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to pay a state visit to Moscow in the spring.",为了进一步彰显两国的密切关系，中国最高领导人习近平预计将在今年春季对俄罗斯进行国事访问。
"China's charm offensive has largely been overshadowed by U.S. accusations that China may be considering supplying Russia's beleaguered military with weapons and ammunition. Forced on the back foot, Mr. Wang, a seasoned diplomat known for his sharp suits and wispy eyebrows, had to provide reassurances and serve as a target for rebukes and warnings.",美国指责中国可能正在考虑向陷入困境的俄罗斯军队提供武器和弹药，这已在很大程度上让中国的魅力攻势黯然失色。这让身穿笔挺西装、长着浓眉、经验丰富的外交官王毅陷入被动，他不得不消除人们的疑虑，并成为指责和警告的对象。
"""I had a conversation with him, and I expressed our strong concern about China providing arms to Russia and asked him not to do that,"" Josep Borrell Fontelles, the top European Union diplomat, told reporters on Monday. ""For us, it would be a red line in our relationship.""","""我与他进行了交谈，我表达了我们对中国向俄罗斯提供武器的强烈担忧，并要求他不要这样做，""欧盟最高外交官何塞普·博雷利·丰特列斯周一对记者说。""对我们来说，这将是我们关系中的一条红线。"""
"As Europe and the United States, again, pressure Beijing not to aid Russia's war, China has few options for responding. Even as it privately tries to soothe concerns, in public it has sought to look firm.",随着欧洲和美国再次向北京施压，要求中国不要为俄罗斯的战争提供支持，中国在回应上几乎没有多少选择。尽管中国私下里试图缓解担忧，但在公开场合却试图表现坚定。
"""It's the U.S., and not China, that has been incessantly supplying weapons to the battlefield, and the U.S. is not qualified to issue any orders to China,"" a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.","""向战场源源不断提供武器的是美方而不是中方。美方没有资格对中方发号施令，""中国外交部发言人周一说。"
China's fiery rhetoric defending its ties with Russia will do little to reassure European officials. China has parroted Russian talking points in the past about how the expansion of NATO warranted the invasion of Ukraine.,中国在捍卫自己与俄罗斯的关系上使用的激烈言辞无助于安抚欧洲官员。中国过去曾照搬俄罗斯的说法，称俄罗斯入侵乌克兰是因为北约的扩张。
"After nearly two years of frosty relations marked by sanctions, the collapse of a major investment deal and a grueling war in Ukraine, European leaders were hoping to hear China moderate its tone and demonstrate a willingness to create more distance between itself and Moscow, analysts said.",分析人士称，在经历了近两年以制裁、重大投资协议的失败以及艰巨的乌克兰战争为标志的冷淡关系后，欧洲领导人曾希望能听到中国缓和语气，表现出想与莫斯科拉开距离的意愿。
"Instead, Mr. Wang arrived at a security conference in Munich, and sharply ramped up a war of words with the United States over a spy balloon incident, describing Washington's response as ""absurd and hysterical."" Mr. Wang also declined to rule out a military confrontation over Taiwan the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory.","然而，王毅在慕尼黑安全会议上大幅升级了就间谍气球事件与美国的舌战，称华盛顿的反应""荒谬且歇斯底里""。王毅也拒绝排除在台湾问题上发生军事对抗的可能性。台湾是一个自治岛屿，北京声称对其拥有主权。"
"""China's charm offensive with Europe hit a wall in Munich,"" said Noah Barkin, a specialist on Chinese-European relations from the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy.","""中国对欧洲的魅力攻势在慕尼黑碰了壁，""研究咨询公司荣鼎咨询的中欧关系专家诺亚·巴尔金说。"
"""At a conference celebrating trans-Atlantic unity on Ukraine, Wang chose to blame the United States for all evils,"" he added. ""It was an epic misreading of the room.""","""在一次庆祝跨大西洋团结的会议上，王毅选择将所有罪恶归咎于美国，""巴尔金还说。""这是极大地看错了形势。"""
"His wider strategy, analysts said, was designed to appeal to Europe's sense of autonomy. The aim was to depict the United States' efforts to impose restrictions on trade with China and rally military support for Ukraine's defense as dragging the region toward a new cold war.",分析人士说，王毅更广泛的战略是打动欧洲的自主意识。目的是把美国在对华贸易上采取限制做法、召集欧盟国家为乌克兰的防御提供军事支持的努力描述为将欧盟拖向一场新冷战。
"Europe has resisted moving in lock step with the United States, declining to blacklist Chinese companies on national security grounds. Huawei, for example, still has a large presence in Germany's telecommunications market. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, speaking at an economic forum in January, said Europe needs to focus on ""de-risking, rather than decoupling"" with China.","欧盟国家已拒绝与美国步调一致，拒绝以国家安全为由将中国公司列入黑名单，例如在德国电信市场仍占有很大份额的华为。欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩今年1月在一个经济论坛上说，欧洲需要把注意力集中在与中国""去风险化，而不是脱钩""。"
"Analysts say China was likely hoping to win support from Europe's business community which has been clamoring to re-enter the Chinese market and tap into fears about the direction of the conflict in Ukraine, which will mark its first anniversary on Friday.",分析人士称，中国可能希望赢得一直要求重新进入中国市场的欧洲商界的支持，同时利用欧洲国家对乌克兰战争走向的担忧。周五是这场冲突一周年的日子。
"""China is making the argument that the war cannot be won, and Europe is becoming the victim of U.S. security strategy,"" said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research institute.","""中国提出的论点是，这场战争打不赢，欧洲正在成为美国安全战略的受害者，""位于华盛顿的研究机构史汀生中心中国项目主任孙云说。"
"Mr. Wang's trip, which took him to France, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Russia, came after years of strained relations between Europe and China.",王毅在这次行程包括法国、意大利、德国、匈牙利和俄罗斯，此前几年时间里，中欧关系一直处于紧张状态。
"The two sides have clashed over Beijing's crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong starting in 2019, and the European Union's decision in 2021 to impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, a far western Chinese region. China retaliated with sanctions on prominent European critics of Beijing.",欧洲已与中国发生过几次冲突，原因包括北京自2019年起镇压香港的各种自由;由于中国在西部偏远地区新疆大规模拘禁维吾尔族穆斯林，欧盟在2021年决定对中国官员实行制裁。中国采取了反制措施，对欧洲著名的中国批评者实施了制裁。
Those tensions derailed a major economic deal between China and the European Union that would have given European companies in China greater legal protections and larger market access. The deal was agreed to in principle in 2020 but never signed.,这些紧张关系导致中国与欧盟的一项重大经济协议流产，该协议本会为欧洲公司在华提供更强的法律保护和更大的市场准入。虽然协议原则上已在2020年达成，但从未签署。
"China has been so eager to revive the trade agreement with Europe that its ambassador to the European Union, Fu Cong, suggested earlier this month that the two sides simultaneously lift their respective sanctions. But tensions over issues such as the treatment of Uyghurs still permeate the relationship: European lawmakers and activists protested a planned trip by the governor of Xinjiang to Europe, forcing China to call it off.",中国一直非常渴望恢复与欧洲的贸易协定，以至于中国驻欧盟大使傅聪曾在本月早些时候暗示，双方可以同时解除各自的制裁。但在对待维吾尔人等问题上的紧张关系弥漫在双方的关系之中:欧盟立法者和活动人士抗议了新疆自治区主席访问欧洲的计划，迫使中国取消了访问。
"Analysts said it was no accident that Mr. Wang skipped Brussels, where the European Union which has led the pushback against Beijing is headquartered. With the exception of Munich, Mr. Wang's itinerary was free of controversy. His meetings in France and Italy involved two countries whose leaders were laying the groundwork to visit Beijing. And Hungary is widely regarded as China's closest friend in the European Union.",分析人士称，王毅此行没有去欧盟总部所在地布鲁塞尔并非偶然，因为欧盟曾带头抵制北京。除了慕尼黑，王毅行程的其他部分没有可争议的地方。他在法国和意大利的会晤涉及的是这两个国家的领导人正在为访华做准备。匈牙利被广泛视为中国在欧盟最亲密的朋友。
"Mr. Barkin said the signal Mr. Wang's chosen destinations aimed to send was that ""China has partners in Europe at a time when it is under pressure on many fronts.""","巴尔金说，王毅去什么地方的选择旨在发出一个信号，即""虽然中国目前在许多方面面临压力，但中国在欧盟有合作伙伴。"""
"But Beijing has little incentive to try to rein in Moscow.Russia's war in Ukraine is diverting Western resources and attention away from Asia, where Beijing is trying to establish its dominance. And, most crucially, a China aligned with Russia would be a far more daunting adversary to the United States should the world's two superpowers ever come to blows.",但中国政府几乎没有约束俄罗斯的动机。俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争正在将西方的资源和注意力从亚洲转移出去，而北京正试图在该地区确立自己的主导地位。而且，最关键的是，如果世界上的两个超级大国发生冲突的话，与俄罗斯结盟的中国对美国来说将是一个更可怕的对手。
"Still, analysts say China could downplay Mr. Xi's visit to Moscow to prevent ties with the West from deteriorating further. Mr. Xi could also visit Western European capitals first, and even hold a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.",尽管如此，分析人士称，中国可能会淡化习近平对莫斯科的访问，以防止与西方的关系进一步恶化。习近平还可能先去西欧各国访问，甚至可以会与乌克兰总统泽连斯基通电话。
"Much of that could depend on how much traction, if any, China receives by serving as a peace broker. Mr. Wang has hinted that Beijing would present a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine soon.",这在很大程度上可能取决于中国作为和平调停者得到的附和(如果有的话)有多大。王毅已暗示北京很快会提出一个解决乌克兰战争的方案。
"Skepticism abounds about any such plan, namely because European officials don't believe Beijing has the ability, or intention, to persuade Moscow to withdraw all its troops from Ukraine, which some leaders consider a prerequisite for any peace deal.",对任何此类方案的怀疑态度大量存在，因为欧洲官员不相信北京有能力或意图说服莫斯科从乌克兰撤出全部军队，一些欧洲领导人认为这是任何和平协议的先决条件。
"""China is good at calling for dialogues,"" said Ms. Sun. ""That's cheap and easy. The hard part is what the settlement looks like and how to convince parties to accept it and implement it. That requires knowledge, impartiality and actual use of influence. China will not touch it with a 10-foot pole.""","""中国善于呼吁对话，""孙云说。""呼吁是轻而易举的。困难的部分是拿出解决方案，以及如何说服各方接受方案并将其执行。这需要知识、公正和使用影响力的具体行动。中国决不会去碰这个。"""
"China's population has begun to decline, a demographic turning point for the country that has global implications. Experts had long anticipated this moment, but it arrived in 2022 several years earlier than expected, prompting hand-wringing among economists over the long-term impacts given the country's immense economic heft and its role as the world's manufacturer.",中国的人口开始下降，这是一个具有全球影响的人口转折点。专家们早就预料到了这一时刻，但它在2022年到来，比预期提前了几年，考虑到中国巨大的经济影响力和它作为世界制造商的角色，经济学家对其长期影响感到担忧。
"With 850,000 fewer births than deaths last year, at least according to the country's official report, China joined an expanding set of nations with shrinking populations caused by years of falling fertility and often little or even negative net migration, a group that includes Italy, Greece and Russia, along with swaths of Eastern and Southern Europe and several Asian nations like South Korea and Japan.",至少根据中国的官方报告，去年，中国的出生人口比死亡人口少了85万，中国加入了一个名单不断增长的国家行列，这些国家人口不断萎缩，原因是多年来生育率下降，净移民往往很少甚至为负，其中包括意大利、希腊和俄罗斯，还有东欧和南欧的一些地区，以及韩国和日本等几个亚洲国家。
"Even places that have not begun to lose population, such as Australia, France and Britain, have been grappling with demographic decline for years as life expectancy increases and women have fewer children.",即使是澳大利亚、法国和英国等人口还没有开始减少的地方，多年来也面临人口结构恶化的难题，原因是预期寿命的增加和女性生育的减少。
"History suggests that once a country crosses the threshold of negative population growth, there is little that its government can do to reverse it. And as a country's population grows more top-heavy, a smaller, younger generation bears the increasing costs of caring for a larger, older one.",历史表明，一旦一个国家跨过人口负增长的门槛，政府就几乎无法扭转这一局面。而且，随着一个国家的人口结构变得越来越头重脚轻，年轻一代的人数会越来越少，将承担越来越高的成本来照顾越来越多的老一代人。
"Even though China's birthrate has fallen substantially over the last five decades, it was long a country with a relatively young population, which meant it could withstand those low rates for a long time before starting to see population losses. Like many developed countries, China's older population is now swelling a consequence of its earlier boom leaving it in a position similar to that of many wealthy nations: in need of more young people.",尽管中国的出生率在过去50年里大幅下降，但长期以来，中国一直是一个人口相对年轻的国家，这意味着在人口开始减少之前，它可以在很长一段时间内承受低出生率。与许多发达国家一样，中国的老年人口正在膨胀——这是早期经济繁荣的结果——这使其处于同许多富裕国家类似的境地:需要更多的年轻人。
"Countries such as the U.S. and Germany have been able to rely on robust immigration, even with relatively low birthrates. But for countries with negative net migration, such as China, more people requires more babies.",尽管美国和德国的出生率相对较低，但它们一直能够依靠强劲的移民。但对于中国等净移民为负的国家，想要更多的人口，就需要更多的婴儿。
"""The good news is that the Chinese government is fully aware of the problem,"" said Yong Cai, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who specializes in Chinese demographics. ""The bad news is, empirically speaking, that there is very little they can do about it.""","""好消息是，中国政府充分意识到了这个问题，""北卡罗来纳大学教堂山分校专门研究中国人口统计的社会学家蔡勇(音)说。""坏消息是，从经验上讲，他们对此无能为力。"""
"That's because the playbook for boosting national birthrates is a rather thin one. Most initiatives that encourage families to have more children are expensive, and the results are often limited. Options include cash incentives for having babies, generous parental leave policies and free or subsidized child care.",这是因为提高全国出生率的手段相当少。大多数鼓励家庭多生孩子的举措都是昂贵的，而且效果往往有限。选择包括对生孩子提供现金奖励、慷慨的产假政策以及免费或补贴的儿童保育。
"Two decades ago, Australia tried a ""baby bonus"" program that paid the equivalent of nearly 6,000 U.S. dollars a child at its peak. At the time the campaign started in 2004, the country's fertility rate was around 1.8 children per woman. (For most developed nations, a fertility rate of 2.1 is the minimum needed for the population to remain steady without immigration.) By 2008, the rate had risen to a high of around 2, but by 2020, six years after the program had ended, it was at 1.6 lower than when the cash payments were first introduced.","20年前，澳大利亚试行了一项""婴儿奖金""计划，最高曾为每个孩子支付近6000美元。2004年这项运动开始时，该国的生育率约为每名女性1.8个孩子。(对于大多数发达国家来说，在没有移民的情况下，保持人口稳定所需的最低生育率为2.1。)到2008年，这一比率上升到2左右的高位，但到2020年，也就是该计划结束六年后，这一比率为1.6——比首次引入现金支付时还要低。"
"By one estimate, the initiative led to an additional24,000 births.",据估计，该计划增加了24000个新生儿。
"Dr. Liz Allen, a demographer atthe Australian National University, said that the program was largely ineffective and that publicly funded paternity leave and child care would have been a more effective use of taxpayer money. ""Government intervention to increase fertility rates is best focused on addressing the issues that prevent people from having their desired family size,"" she said.","澳大利亚国立大学的人口统计学家利兹·艾伦表示，这个项目基本上是无效的，用公共资金资助陪产假和儿童保育本可以更有效地利用纳税人的钱。她说:""政府提高生育率的干预最好集中在解决那些阻碍人们拥有理想家庭规模的问题上。"""
"Experts say the most effective initiatives address social welfare, employment policy and other underlying economic issues. France, Germany and Nordic countries like Sweden and Denmark have had notable success in arresting the decline in birthrates, often through government-funded child care or generous parental leave policies.",专家表示，最有效的措施是解决社会福利、就业政策和其它深层经济问题。法国、德国以及瑞典和丹麦等北欧国家在遏制出生率下降方面都取得了显著成功，它们一般都是通过政府提供育儿津贴或慷慨的产假政策来实现的。
"But even the success of those efforts has had limits, with no country able to reach a sustained return to the 2.1 replacement rate. (The U.S. rate fell below 2.1 in the 1970s, slowly rose back up to the replacement rate by 2007, then collapsed again after the Great Recession, to a current level just below 1.7.)",但这些举措的成功仍然有限，没有一个国家的人口替代率能够持续恢复到2.1的水平。(美国的替代率在上世纪70年代跌至2.1以下，然后缓慢回升直到2007年，金融海啸引发的经济大衰退后再次下跌，目前的水平是1.7。)
"""You're not going to reverse the trend, but if you throw in the kitchen sink and make childbearing more attractive, you may be able to prevent the population from falling off a cliff,"" saidJohn Bongaarts, a demographer at the Population Council, a research institution in New York.","纽约研究机构人口会议(Population Council)的人口学家约翰·邦加茨表示，""你不可能扭转这个趋势，但如果加大力度，让生育变得更具吸引力的话，或许就能防止人口坠崖式下降。"""
"Sweden is often cited as a model for increasing fertility rates, thanks to agovernment-boosted jump in its birthrate. After introducing nine months of parental leave in the 1970s and implementing a ""speed premium"" in 1980 (which incentivized mothers to have multiple children within a set period), Sweden saw fertility rise from around 1.6 early in the decade to a peak just above the replacement rate by 1990. (The country has since increased its parental leave to 16 months, among the highest in the world.)","瑞典经常被视作提高生育率的典范，这要归功于政府的推动。它在上世纪70年代引入了9个月的产假，并在1980年推出""速度津贴""(鼓励母亲在规定的时间内生育多个孩子)之后，瑞典的生育率从那个十年之初的1.6左右上升到1990年的峰值，略高于替代率。(自那以后，瑞典的产假增加到了16个月，是世界上产假最长的国家之一。)"
"After that uptick, however, Sweden's birthrate fell through the '90s. Over the last 50 years, its fertility rate has fluctuated significantly, rising roughly in tandem with economic booms. And while the country still has one of the highest fertility rates among the most advanced economies, over the past decade it has followed a trajectory similar to that of most developed nations: down.",然而，在那次上升之后，瑞典的出生率在整个90年代都呈下降趋势。在过去的50年里，它的生育率起伏很大，大致上在经济繁荣的时候生育率就上升。尽管在最发达的经济体中，该国的生育率仍然属于最高的国家，但在过去10年里，它与大多数发达国家的人口轨迹类似:下降。
"Recent research suggests a reason Sweden's fertility spikes were only temporary: Families rushed to have children they were already planning to have. Stuart Gietel-Basten, a demographer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said financial incentives seldom increase the overall number of children born, but instead encourage families to take advantage of benefits that may not last. The spikes, he added, can have unforeseen consequences. ""When you have 50,000 children born one year, 100,000 the next, and then 50,000 the year after that, it is really bad for planning and education,"" he said.","最近有研究指出，瑞典生育率只是暂时性飙升的一个原因是:家庭急于生育他们已经计划要的孩子。香港科技大学的人口学家斯图尔特·吉特尔-巴斯滕说，经济方面的激励措施很少会增加子女的总数，但会鼓励家庭利用可能不会持续的福利。他还说，这种出生率的飙升可能会产生意想不到的后果。他说:""如果一年有5万个孩子出生，接下来一年有10万个，后年又是5万个，这对规划和教育领域来说，真的很糟糕。"""
"Few countries have embraced pronatalist policies as vigorously as Hungary, whose right-wing populist leader, Viktor Orban, is dedicating 5 percent of the nation's G.D.P. toward increasing birthrates. The government encourages procreation through generous loans that become gifts upon the birth of multiple children, tax forgiveness for mothers who have three children, and free fertility treatments.",很少有国家像匈牙利那样大力推行生育鼓励政策，它的右翼民粹主义领导人欧尔班·维克托将国内生产总值的5%用来促进出生率的提高。政府通过慷慨的贷款(如果生育多个孩子可以免还贷款)、生三个孩子的母亲享有免税待遇、免费的生育治疗等方式鼓励生育。
"Around the time these efforts began under Mr. Orban in 2010, Hungary's fertility rate was just over 1.2, among the lowest in Europe. Over the 2010s, that rate climbed to around 1.6 a modest improvement at a high cost.",大约在2010年欧尔班开始采取这些措施时，匈牙利的生育率仅略高于1.2，是欧洲生育率最低的国家之一。在2010年代，这一比率升至1.6左右——这是一个有限的进步，而且成本不菲。
"It remains to be seen how far China will go to stem its decline in population, which was set in motion when the country's fertility rate began to plummet decades ago. That drop began even before the country's family planning policies limiting most families to a single child, introduced in 1979. Those who defied the rules were punished with fines and even forced abortions.",中国能在多大程度上遏制人口下降仍有待观察。中国的人口下降是在几十年前该国的生育率开始急剧下降后开始的。这一下降趋势甚至在1979年中国出台计划生育政策，规定大多数家庭只能生一个孩子之前就已经开始了。那些违反计生规定的人会受到罚款，甚至强制堕胎。
"The official end of Beijing's one-child policy in 2016, however, has not led to a rise in births, despitecash incentives and tax cuts for parents. The country's fertility rate rose slightly around that time, but has fallen since, according to data from the United Nations: from around 1.7 children per woman, on par with Australia and Britain, to around 1.2, among the lowest in the world. That recent drop could be a result of unreliable data from China or a technical effect of delays in childbearing, but it likely also reflects a combination of various pressures that have mounted in the country over time.",然而，中国独生子女政策在2016年的正式结束并没有促使出生率上升，即使为父母提供了现金奖励和减税措施。根据联合国的数据，该国的生育率在那个时候略有上升，但此后一直在下降:女性生育率从与澳大利亚和英国持平的1.7降至约1.2，处于世界生育率排名末端。最近的下降可能是由于来自中国的数据不可靠或有意延迟怀孕的影响，但它也可能反映了该国受到的各种随着时间的推移而增加的压力的综合效应。
"Even though they are now allowed to, many young Chinese are not interested in having large families. Vastly more young Chinese people are enrolling in higher education, marrying later and having children later. Raised in single-child households, some have come to see small families as normal. But the bigger impediment to having a second or third child is financial, according to Lauren A. Johnston, an economist at the University of Sydney who studies Chinese demographics. She said many parents cite the high cost of housing and education as the main obstacle to having more children. ""People can't afford to buy space for themselves, let alone for two kids,"" she said.","尽管现在允许生育多孩，但许多中国年轻人对拥有大家庭不感兴趣。越来越多的中国年轻人正在接受高等教育，晚婚晚育。在独生子女家庭长大的一些人开始认为小家庭是常态。但悉尼大学研究中国人口统计的经济学家劳伦·A·约翰斯顿表示，生第二个或第三个孩子的更大障碍是经济条件。她说，许多父母认为高昂的住房和教育成本是生育更多孩子的主要障碍。""人们无力为自己购买居住空间，更不用说为两个孩子了，""她说。"
"China's government could ease the burden on young families through housing subsidies, extended parental leave and increased funding for education and pensions, experts say. Other policy changes, like reforming the country's restrictive household registration system and raising the official retirement age female blue-collar workers must retire at 50, for example could boost the nation's working-age population, alleviating some of the economic strain that comes with population decline.",专家表示，中国政府可以通过住房补贴、延长育儿假以及增加教育和养老金资金来减轻年轻家庭的负担。其它政策变化，比如对限制性的户籍制度进行改革和提高法定退休年龄——例如，女性蓝领工人必须在50岁退休——可能会增加该国的劳动年龄人口，缓解人口下降带来的一些经济压力。
"Though the Chinese are unlikely to find more success than the Swedes in recovering a high fertility rate, ""there is low-hanging fruit that can allow them to squeeze more productivity and higher labor force participation from the population,""said Gerard DiPippo, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.","尽管中国人在恢复高生育率方面不太可能获得比瑞典人更多的成果，但""有一些唾手可得的成果可以让他们从人口中榨取更高的生产力和更高的劳动力参与率""，战略与国际研究中心高级研究员杰拉德·迪皮波说。"
"All this points to a Chinese population, currently 1.4 billion, that is likely to continue shrinking. In contrast to economists who have cast China's population decline as a grim sign for global growth, many demographers have been more sanguine, noting the benefits ofa smaller population.",所有这些都表明，目前14亿的中国人口可能会继续减少。经济学家将中国人口下降视为严重威胁全球增长的迹象，相比之下，许多人口学家相对乐观，他们注意到人口减少的好处。
"John Wilmoth, director of the Population Division at the United Nations, said that after decades of exponential growth in which the world's population doubled to more than seven billion between 1970 to 2014, the doom-and-gloom assessments about declining fertility rates and depopulation tend to be overstated. Japan has been battling population decline since the 1970s, he noted, but it remains one of the world's largest economies. ""It has not been the disaster that people imagined,"" Mr.Wilmoth said. ""Japan is not in a death spiral.""","联合国人口司司长约翰·威尔莫斯表示，经过数十年的指数增长，世界人口在1970年至2014年期间翻了一番，超过70亿，关于生育率下降和人口减少的悲观绝望的评估倾向于被夸大了。他指出，自1970年代以来，日本一直在与人口下降作斗争，但它仍然是世界上最大的经济体之一。""这并不是人们想象中的灾难，""威尔莫斯说。""日本没有陷入死亡漩涡。"""
"Worldwide, fertility remains above the replacement rate, which means that allowing more immigration will continue to be an option for many developed nations, even those that historically haven't relied on it: Before the pandemic, net migration into Japan, while relatively low, had been increasing steadily.",在世界范围来看，生育率仍然高于替代率，这意味着允许接收更多移民将继续成为许多发达国家的一个选择，即使是那些历史上不依赖移民的国家:在大流行之前，日本净移民数字虽然相对较低，但一直在稳步增长。
"Without immigration, pragmatic and noncoercive measures that encourage parents to have families while pursuing careers as well as policiesthat allow people in their 60s and 70s to keep working are the key to managing negative population growth, Mr. Wilmoth said. ""Population stabilization is overall a good thing,"" he said. ""All societies need to adapt to having older populations. What really matters is the speed of change, and how fast we get from here to there.""","威尔莫斯表示，如果没有移民，以务实和非强制措施鼓励夫妇在追求事业的同时生育孩子，以及允许60多岁和70多岁的人继续工作的政策，是应对人口负增长的关键。""总体而言，人口稳定是一件好事，""他说。""所有社会都需要适应人口老龄化。真正重要的是变化的速度，用多少时间从现在发展到那个状态。"""
"Bristling against U.S. claims that Beijing may be poised to send ""lethal support"" to help Russia's war in Ukraine, China accused the Biden administration on Monday of spreading lies and defended its close partnership with Russia.","美国声称北京可能准备提供""致命性支持""帮助俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争，针对该说法，中国周一指责拜登政府散布谎言，并为其与俄罗斯的密切伙伴关系进行了辩护。"
"The remarks, by a spokesman from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were part of a series of moves by China as the country's leader, Xi Jinping, tries to keep Russia close but also repair ties with Western powers. He has sought to preserve relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia while casting Beijing as a blameless onlooker in his invasion of Ukraine, trying only to coax Moscow and Kyiv into peace talks.",中国领导人习近平试图与俄罗斯保持密切联系——但同时也希望修复与西方大国的关系，而中国外交部发言人的这番言论是其一系列行动的一部分。习近平试图维持与俄罗斯总统普京的关系，同时将北京在普京入侵乌克兰战争中的角色定位为无可指责的旁观者，只是在试图劝服莫斯科和基辅进行和平谈判。
"Over the weekend, the U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, indicated that he had evidence that, behind the scenes, Beijing was tilting toward stronger support for Mr. Putin and ""considering providing lethal support to Russia in its aggression against Ukraine.""","上周末，美国国务卿布林肯表示，他有证据表明，在幕后，北京倾向于更强有力地支持普京，并""考虑为俄罗斯侵略乌克兰提供致命性支持""。"
"Such a step would be a major shift for China, which has defended its broader economic, energy and political ties with Moscow but not supplied it with weapons, ammunition or other battlefield equipment for the invasion. Mr. Blinken said he had warned his Chinese counterpart that there would be serious consequences were that to occur.",这样的一步对于中国来说将是一个重大转变，它一直在捍卫与莫斯科保持更广泛的经济、能源和政治关系，但没有为入侵提供武器、弹药或其他战场装备。布林肯说，他已警告中国同行，如果发生这种情况，后果将非常严重。
"Asked about the accusations from Mr. Blinken and other U.S. officials, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, suggested that, on the contrary, it was the United States that was implicated in bloodshed in Ukraine.",当被问及布林肯和其他美国官员的指责时，外交部发言人汪文斌表示，恰恰相反，卷入乌克兰流血冲突的正是美国。
"""It's the U.S., and not China, that has been incessantly supplying weapons to the battlefield, and the U.S. is not qualified to issue any orders to China,"" Mr. Wang told a news conference in Beijing. Washington, Mr. Wang added, should ""stop shirking responsibility and disseminating fake news. China will continue firmly standing on the side of dialogue and the side of peace.""","""向战场源源不断提供武器的是美方而不是中方。美方没有资格对中方发号施令，""汪文斌在北京的新闻发布会上说。他还表示，华盛顿应该""停止甩锅推责、散播虚假信息，中方将继续坚定站在对话一边，站在和平一边""。"
"Mr. Wang was asked about reports that Wang Yi China's most senior foreign policy official was due to arrive in Moscow after meeting with Mr. Blinken at the Munich Security Conference. Mr. Putin may meet with him in Moscow, according to Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman.",汪文斌被问及有关中国最高外交政策官员王毅在慕尼黑安全会议上与布林肯会面后将抵达莫斯科的报道。克里姆林宫发言人德米特里·佩斯科夫表示，普京可能会在莫斯科与他会面。
"U.S. officials are watching Mr. Wang's trip closely, which comes after the Chinese official spoke in Munich in defense of Beijing's straddling position on Russia and the war in Ukraine.",美国官员正在密切关注王毅的行程，此前后者在慕尼黑发表讲话，为北京在俄乌战争上的骑墙立场辩护。
"""We are deeply concerned by the expanded and extended crisis,"" Mr. Wang, the top official, said when asked about the war during a question-and-answer session in Munich. He also hinted that he thought the United States had a geopolitical interest in perpetuating the fighting in Ukraine.","在慕尼黑的问答环节被问及这场战争时，王毅表示:""我们对冲突扩大化、长期化感到担忧。""他还暗示，他认为美国有地缘政治利益让乌克兰的战斗永久化。"
"""Some forces may not want to see peace talks materialize,"" Mr. Wang said. ""They don't care about the life and death of the Ukrainians, nor the harm to Europe. They may have strategic goals larger than Ukraine itself.""","""看来有些势力并不希望和谈成功，""王毅说。""他们并不在乎乌克兰人民的死活，也不关心欧洲受到的损害，而是有着更大的战略目标。"""
"China and Mr. Xi have been entangled in tensions between the United States and Russia since early last year, even before Russian troops poured into Ukraine.",自去年初以来，甚至在俄罗斯军队涌入乌克兰之前，中国和习近平就已身陷美俄之间的紧张局势中。
"Back then, Mr. Xi hosted Mr. Putin in Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympics, and the two authoritarian leaders declared a friendship with ""no limits"" between their countries. Mr. Xi also endorsed Mr. Putin's grievances against NATO, opposing its possible eastward expansion. Less than three weeks after that, Mr. Putin launched his sweeping attack on Ukraine.","当时，习近平在北京接待普京参加冬季奥运会开幕式，两位专制领导人宣布两国之间建立""没有止境""的友谊。习近平还肯定了普京对北约的不满，反对北约可能的东扩。此后不到三周，普京对乌克兰发动了全面进攻。"
"Since then, officials in Beijing have defended their alignment with Russia, while insisting that they want peace in Ukraine and respect its sovereignty. In the eyes of Chinese leaders, their relationship with Russia is an essential counterweight against American power, said Alexander Korolev, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Australia who studies Chinese-Russian relations.",从那以后，北京官员为他们与俄罗斯的结盟辩护，同时坚称他们希望乌克兰实现和平并尊重其主权。澳大利亚新南威尔士大学研究中俄关系的高级讲师亚历山大·科罗廖夫说，在中国领导人看来，他们与俄罗斯的关系是对美国力量的重要制衡。
"""For China, Russia is a potential ally for its confrontation with the United States, and Xi Jinping will cash his check if there is a conflict between China and the U.S.,"" Mr. Korolev said in a telephone interview. ""I don't think Beijing is happy about what Russia is doing, but it cannot afford to lose its only great power strategic partner.""","""对中国来说，俄罗斯是与美国对抗的潜在盟友，如果中美之间发生冲突，习近平将会兑现支票，""科罗廖夫在电话采访中说。""我不认为北京对俄罗斯的所为感到高兴，但它不能失去唯一的大国战略伙伴。"""
"Even so, if China were to send weapons or any other form of ""lethal support"" to Russia for the war, that would likely deeply alarm Washington as well as European leaders, jeopardizing Mr. Xi's efforts to rebuild his country's connections with the world after three years of pandemic-induced isolation. Since late last year, he has been trying to draw closer to Germany, France and other European countries. He attempted to cool tensions with Washington, until a quarrel this month over a Chinese surveillance balloon shot down over the United States put that effort on hold.","即便如此，如果中国为了此次战争向俄罗斯提供武器或任何其他形式的""致命性支持""的话，很可能会让华盛顿以及欧洲领导人深感震惊，并且危及习近平在三年大流行的孤立后重建中国与世界联系的努力。自去年年底以来，习近平一直在努力拉近与德国、法国和其他欧洲国家的关系。他试图缓和与华盛顿的紧张关系，直到本月一个中国侦察气球在美国上空被击落而引发争执，使得这一努力搁浅。"
"Although the Chinese government has sought to promote negotiations rather than war in Ukraine, Beijing has not taken big diplomatic gambles to try to bring talks about.",尽管中国政府一直在寻求促进乌克兰的谈判而不是战争，但北京并没有采取大的外交赌博来试图促成谈判。
"Mr. Wang, the senior diplomat, said Beijing would soon issue a position paper detailing a plan for peace. But the paper is likely to affirm Beijing's longstanding views, rather than offer a new approach, to judge from Mr. Wang's comments.",高级外交官王毅说，北京方面不久将发布一份立场文件，详细阐述和平计划。但从王毅的讲话来看，这份文件可能会重申北京的长期观点，而不是提供新的方法。
"""We will reiterate the propositions made by President Xi Jinping,"" Mr. Wang told the audience in Munich. ""We will also reiterate that nuclear wars must not be fought and will not be won.""","""这份文件将重申习近平主席的重要主张，""王毅在慕尼黑对听众说。""我们将重申核战争打不得也打不赢。"""
"During their meeting in Munich, Mr. Blinken told Mr. Wang, the senior diplomat, about ""a growing concern on our part that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia in its aggression against Ukraine,"" Mr. Blinken later said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week.""","布林肯后来接受美国广播公司《本周》(This Week)节目采访时表示，在慕尼黑会晤期间，布林肯告诉高级外交官王毅，""我们越来越担心，中国正在考虑为俄罗斯侵略乌克兰提供致命性支持""。"
"Mr. Blinken said, ""I made clear, as President Biden has almost from day one with President Xi that that would have serious consequences in our own relationship.""","""我明确表示，这将对我们双方的关系产生严重后果，正如拜登总统几乎是从战争的第一天起就对习主席挑明的一样。"""
"Mr. Blinken said the aid would consist of weapons and ammunition, but he did not offer specifics, nor did he describe the intelligence that the Biden administration presumably acquired to arrive at this conclusion.",布林肯说，援助将包括武器和弹药，但他没有提供具体细节，也没有描述拜登政府可能获得了哪些情报，从而得出这一结论。
"Without more details to go by, it is difficult to judge what ""lethal support"" the Biden administration believes Beijing might consider providing, several experts said.","几位专家说，由于没有更多细节可循，很难判断拜登政府认为北京可能考虑提供哪些""致命性支持""。"
"One possible concern to Washington may be Chinese-made drones, said Mr. Korolev, the expert on Russia's relations with China. Beijing's deepening military ties with Russia, including regular joint exercises and Chinese copies of Russian weaponry meant Chinese suppliers could be familiar with other military technology.",俄中关系专家科罗廖夫说，华盛顿关注的一个问题可能是中国制造的无人机。北京与俄罗斯不断加深的军事关系，包括定期的联合演习和中国对俄罗斯武器装备的仿制，意味着中国供应商可能熟悉其他军事技术。
"But, Mr. Korolev said, China may see little benefit from wading into the fighting when neither Ukraine nor Russia appears likely to collapse, or emerge as victor, anytime soon.",但是，科罗廖夫说，在乌克兰和俄罗斯似乎都不可能很快崩溃或是取胜的情况下，中国可能认为涉足战斗没有什么好处。
"""China can keep sitting on the fence,"" he said. ""Even if China decides to support Russia, everything will be done to hide that.""","""中国可以继续骑墙观望，""他说。""即使中国决定支持俄罗斯，也会想尽办法掩盖这一点。"""
"Drew Thompson, formerly responsible for relations with China under the U.S. Secretary of Defense, said that U.S. officials may have caught wind of Chinese military officials or arms makers discussing possible exports to Russia, and Chinese diplomats may not be aware of those discussions. He noted that he was no longer privy to U.S. government internal discussions.",曾在美国国防部长手下负责对华关系的唐安竹(Drew Thompson)说，美国官员可能得到了中国军事官员或武器制造商讨论向俄罗斯出口武器的风声，而中国外交官可能并不知道这些讨论。他指出，自己已不再了解美国政府的内部讨论。
"""There does not appear to be a functioning policy coordination process in China,"" said Mr. Thompson, now a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.","""中国似乎没有一个行之有效的政策协调过程，""唐安竹说。他现在是新加坡李光耀公共政策学院的高级访问研究员。"
WASHINGTON A People's Liberation Army veteran turned drone manufacturer. A Shanghai real estate company that wagered there was more profit in high-altitude airships. An eminent Chinese aviation scientist who started more than a dozen companies to commercialize his expertise.,华盛顿——一位解放军退伍军人成为了无人机制造商。上海一家房地产公司押注高空飞艇，认为该行业的利润更高。一位创办了十几家公司的著名中国航空科学家将他的专业知识商业化。
Each sought to help their business by supporting China's military modernization. Each now stands accused by the United States of helping to build China's spy balloons.,每个人都试图通过支持中国的军事现代化来助力他们的企业。现在，每个人都被美国指控帮助中国制造间谍气球。
"The international fracas over those high-altitude balloons has thrown a light on China's program of ""military-civil fusion."" Xi Jinping, China's leader, has pushed the recruiting of commercial businesses to help build what he has described as a world-class military guarding China's rise as a superpower. The aim is to create a symbiotic relationship that provides the military with wider, faster access to commercial innovations, while also giving businesses contracts and military skills.","围绕这些高空气球的国际喧嚣揭示了中国的""军民融合""计划。在中国领导人习近平推动下，为了建设他展望的世界级军队，保卫崛起为超级大国的中国，商企也被吸收进来。其目的是建立一种共生关系，为军队提供更广泛、更快的商业创新途径，同时也为企业提供合同和军事技能。"
"Several Chinese makers of airships and their components that were blacklisted by the U.S. government last Friday over China's balloon program have ties to this effort, corporate records and other Chinese documents show.",公司记录和其他中国文件显示，上周五因中国气球计划而被美国政府列入黑名单的几家中国飞行器及零部件制造商与该计划有关。
"One of the companies, Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group, proclaimed itself ""one of the national model businesses of military-civil fusion."" Another firm, Guangzhou Tian-Hai-Xiang Aviation Technology, primarily a drone manufacturer, was founded by a former soldier who had fought in China's border war with Vietnam in 1979.","其中一家名为铱格斯曼航空科技集团的公司宣称自己是""国内军民融合的标杆企业之一""。另一家公司广州天海翔航空科技有限公司主要是一家无人机制造商，由一位曾在1979年参加过中越边境战争的退伍军人创立。"
"""If you come from the military, you should give back to it,"" the company's founder and chairman, Li Yuzhuang, has said.","""从部队中来，就要回报部队，""该公司的创始人兼董事长李裕壮说。"
"China is far from alone in seeking to harness the dynamism and innovation of commercial businesses to help build a more technologically advanced military. Chinese officials and experts have cited lessons from the Pentagon's partnerships with American companies developing cutting-edge technologies, as well as the role of companies like SpaceX in the American aerospace industry.",并非只有中国在寻求利用商企的活力和创新，协助建设一支技术更先进的军队。五角大楼与美国公司合作开发尖端技术，SpaceX等公司在美国航空航天业中发挥了作用，中国官员和专家从中吸取了经验。
"But the Communist Party's sweeping power means that its military priorities demand even greater attention, and loyalty, from many Chinese business leaders. Mr. Xi has long sought to develop technological self-sufficiency, and that effort is likely to accelerate in the wake of Washington's expanding restrictions on Chinese access to microchips.",但共产党的绝对权力意味着其军事优先事项需要许多中国商界领袖的更多关注和忠诚度。长期以来，习近平一直寻求发展技术自给自足，随着华盛顿对中国获取微芯片的限制不断加强，这一努力可能会加速。
"""Given its concern about foreign sanctions and export controls, what we are now seeing is more and more efforts by the Chinese side to try to build up a much more significant civil military fusion system,"" said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and the author of ""Innovate to Dominate: The Rise of the Chinese Techno-Security State."" He called these efforts ""an important part of this drive for self-reliance in the strategic and defense sectors.""","""鉴于中国对外国制裁和出口管制的担忧，我们看到中国方面正越来越努力地试图建立一个更有效的军民融合系统，""《创新以主宰:中国技术安全国家的崛起》(Innovate to Dominate: The Rise of the Chinese Techno-Security State)作者、加利福尼亚州圣地亚哥分校教授张太铭说。他称这些努力是""推动战略和国防部门自立自强的重要组成部分""。"
"By the time that Mr. Xi came to power in 2012, Chinese leaders had been trying for decades to get civilian industries to work closely with the military. Rivalry between Beijing and Western governments was growing, and homegrown innovation was increasingly important to China's security. But many of China's innovators were in the private sector, and those that sought to do business with the military often encountered distrust and red tape.",在习近平2012年上台之前的几十年里，中国领导人已经在让民用工业与军方密切合作。北京与西方政府之间的竞争日益激烈，本土创新对中国的安全越来越重要。但中国的许多创新者都在私营部门，那些寻求与军方做生意的人经常不被信任，还要应对官僚作风。
"Mr. Xi rolled out a vigorous program to press businesses to share their talent and technology. Local governments established funds to support the development of drones, robots and other technologies with military applications. In 2017, Mr. Xi underscored the urgency of the initiative by putting himself in charge of a newly founded national committee to oversee it. It was, he told the committee, ""a major step to win a national strategic advantage.""","习近平推出了一项强有力的计划，敦促企业分享他们的人才和技术。地方政府设立基金，支持无人机、机器人等军事应用技术的发展。2017年，习近平亲自领导一个新成立的国家委员会来监督该倡议，从而强调了该倡议的紧迫性。他告诉委员会，这是""赢得国家战略优势的重大举措""。"
"Over three dozen investment funds dedicated to this effort have been founded in China since 2015, with an anticipated ability to disperse a total of more than $68.5 billion to firms, according to a 2021 study by Elsa B. Kania and Lorand Laskai at the Center for a New American Security.",根据新美国安全中心的埃尔萨·B·卡尼亚和雷洛然在2021年的一项研究，自2015年以来，中国已经成立了超过30多家致力于这项计划的投资基金，预计能够向企业拨发总计超过685亿美元的资金。
"In China today there is a complex network of linkages between military applications, commercialization and academic research into emerging technologies, connections that are ""hardly coincidental,"" Ms. Kania said.","卡尼亚说，如今在中国，新兴技术的军事应用、商业化和学术研究之间存在复杂的联系网络，这些联系""绝非巧合""。"
Those linkages have in turn raised concerns in Washington that American goods or technologies sold through civilian supply chains could ultimately find military uses. Those fears prompted the Trump administration to cut Huawei off from buying U.S. technologies and prohibit American citizens from investing in the securities of certain companies linked with the Chinese military.,这转而引起了华盛顿的担忧，即通过民用供应链销售的美国商品或技术最终可能会用于军事用途。这些担忧促使特朗普政府禁止华为购买美国技术，并禁止美国公民投资某些与中国军方有关联的公司的证券。
"Officials in the Biden administration have also concluded that, at least in certain narrow sectors of the economy, not even commercial ties with China are safe. On Thursday, the Justice and Commerce departments announced that they had set up a new ""strike force"" in 12 U.S. cities to help prevent advanced technology from being shared with adversaries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.","拜登政府官员还得出结论，至少在某些具体的经济领域，即使只与中国保持商业联系也是不安全的。周四，司法部和商务部宣布，已在美国12座城市设置新的""打击力量""，以防止中国、俄罗斯、伊朗和朝鲜等对手获得先进技术。"
"The Biden administration has fortified the country's system of export controls to stop companies from sharing advanced technologies like quantum computing with China. Likewise, the administration's move to place five Chinese companies and a research institute that had supported military airship and balloon programs on a blacklist is aimed at preventing them from purchasing U.S. technology.",拜登政府加强了出口管制，禁止企业向中国提供量子计算等尖端技术。同时，拜登政府还将曾支持军用飞艇和气球项目的五家中国企业及一家研究机构列入黑名单，为的正是阻止其购买美国技术。
The companies have not responded to phone calls seeking comment.,相关企业没有回应寻求置评的电话。
"Experts caution that enduring state monopolies in the Chinese defense sector, and a general attitude of distrust toward private business, have meant that China's efforts to bridge the divide between its military and private business is still very much a work in progress.",专家提醒称，中国国防部门存在长期的国家垄断，再加上对私企的普遍不信任，意味着中国试图弥合军事和私营部门之间的努力还任重道远。
But some firms have clearly benefited from China's drive to entice private companies to work with the military.,但一些企业显然成了中国推动私企与军方合作的受益者。
"Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group, for example, which was founded by the leading Chinese aeronautics scientist Wu Zhe, sold 16 percent of its shares to three government-backed investment funds focused on military-civil opportunities, according to corporate records.",铱格斯曼航空科技集团就是个例子，根据企业档案，该公司创始人、中国著名航空科学家武哲将公司16%的股份出售给了三家政府支持的投资基金，这些基金都专注于军民融合领域。
"Eagles Men Aviation had ""continuously supplied stealth concealment materials to the Chinese military for 14 years, and its stratospheric airship flight data is at world-leading level,"" an executive told officials visiting its Beijing headquarters in 2019.","铱格斯曼航空的一位高管在2019年对参观其北京总部的官员表示，该公司""已为中国军方提供14年持续供应，平流层航空器飞行数据位于世界领先水平""。"
"Wu Zhe helped to found another firm facing sanctions, Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology, alongside Shanghai Nanjiang Group, a real estate firm that had also ventured into graphene, intelligent robots and airborne vehicles. Beijing Nanjiang also signed a deal with Xilinhot, a city in northern China, to build a ""near-space industrial park"" where test flights could be held.","武哲参与创立的企业还有北京南江空天科技——另一家面临制裁的企业，此外还包括房地产公司上海南江集团，其业务涉及石墨烯、智能机器人和航空设备。北京南江公司还与中国北方城市锡林浩特签订协议，打造一处可进行试飞的""临近空间产业园""。"
"According to tracking by David Asher, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, one of Nanjiang's subsidiaries appears to have sold drones directly to the People's Liberation Army.",根据哈德逊研究所高级研究员戴维·阿舍尔追踪的数据，南江的一家分公司可能直接向解放军出售了无人机。
"Traditionally the Chinese military would have acquired such technology from state-controlled entities, he said. But these links may suggest the P.L.A. is sourcing what were originally commercially developed balloons and drones and ""applying them to military missions, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.""","他表示，一般来说中国军方会从国家控制的实体获得此类技术。但这些关联可能暗示解放军正在采购最初由民用企业开发的气球和无人机，并将其""应用于情报、监视和侦察等军事任务""。"
"""Nanjiang Group operates in a manner that is emblematic of a new type of civil-military fusion,"" Mr. Asher said.","""南江集团的运营方式代表了一种新型的军民融合，""阿舍尔说。"
"Mr. Wu also helped to set up a venture capital company that invested in a collection of satellite, hydrogen power and aerospace companies with funding from Beihang University, a top military university also under sanctions from the United States, according to documents accessed through Sayari, a commercial risk intelligence platform.",根据通过商业风险情报平台Sayari获得的记录，武哲还参与创办了一家风投公司，投资了许多卫星、氢能和航空航天企业，其资金来自北航大学，这是一所同样受到美国制裁的顶级军事学府。
"One of these companies, Dongguan Zhonghang Huaxun Satellite Technology, advertised on its website airships installed with monitoring systems, including for military needs, The Wire China previously reported. The website has been taken down.",据《连线中国》此前报道，其中一家名为中航华讯卫星技术的公司在其网站上宣传了装有监控系统的飞艇，包括了满足军事需求的功能。该网站已被关闭。
"Even in China, though, these military ties have not been a sure way to riches. By 2019, for example, Shanghai Nanjiang Group's near-space project was foundering financially, and the company announced that it had terminated the program.",然而即使在中国，这些军方关系也不一定必然通向致富。例如，上海南江集团的临近空间项目在2019年面临资金困难，宣布终止该项目。
"The ""near-space industrial park"" in northern China became caught up in legal disputes over shoddy construction and high costs. A company that Mr. Wu partnered with called Dongfeng Sci-Tech Group delisted from the Shenzhen stock exchange in 2020, after some of its forays into high technology were panned.","而地处北方的""临近空间产业园""因施工质量差、造价高等问题陷入法律纠纷。2020年，与武哲合作的东沣科技集团从深圳证券交易所退市，此前该公司涉及高科技领域的部分业务遭遇亏损。"
"While Washington has clearly seized on the risks posed by Chinese corporate-military partnerships, some analysts say the reaction may be going too far. Some have argued that previous characterizations of China as a ""whole-of-society threat"" contribute to ethnic profiling of Chinese citizens and some Chinese Americans, and deter valuable academic partnerships.","虽然华盛顿已经明确察觉中国企业与军方合作带来的风险，但一些分析人士指出，这样的反应可能有些过头。一些人认为，此前将中国定性为""全社会威胁""，助长了对中国公民和部分美籍华人的种族归纳，损害了有价值的学术合作。"
"The balloon episode in particular has provoked ""a certain sense of hysteria"" in the last few weeks, said Christopher K. Johnson, the president of China Strategies Group, and a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency.","中国战略集团总裁、中央情报局前中国事务高级分析师张克斯(Christopher K.Johnson)表示，过去这段时间，气球事件尤其引发了""某种狂热情绪""。"
"When the U.S. government cuts off trade with Chinese firms and sectors, there are also costs to U.S. competitiveness, in losing access to revenue and innovation, Mr. Johnson said. ""You've just got to be thoughtful about it.""","张克斯说，当美国政府切断与中国各企业部门的贸易往来，美国国力也将受到损害，失去营收和创新的良机。""必须三思而后行。"""
"WUHAN, China Thousands of retirees confronted local officials and the police outside a popular park in the central Chinese city of Wuhan to demand the repeal of recent cuts in government-provided medical insurance for seniors.",中国武汉——数千名退休人员在中国中部城市武汉一个著名公园外与当地官员和警察对峙，要求取消最近政府对老年人医疗保险的削减。
"The protest on Wednesday, the second in Wuhan in a week, was the latest sign of strain on the finances of China's local governments, which are responsible for covering much of the cost of everything from health care to heating homes. China's ""zero Covid"" policies, dictated by Beijing over the past three years, saddled those localities with additional costs, while a downturn in the real estate market eroded a reliable stream of revenue.","周三的抗议是武汉一周内发生的第二次抗议活动，也是中国地方政府财政紧张的最新迹象。地方政府负责支付从医疗到供暖等种种费用的很大部分。北京在过去三年里制定的""清零""政策让这些地方承担了额外的成本，房地产市场的低迷则侵蚀了一个可靠的收入来源。"
"Video footage that circulated online indicated that large crowds gathered around Zhongshan Park in Wuhan, as the police tried to divide them by imposing barricades. When police officers tried to push the crowds back, older men and women refused to back off and shouted in officers' faces. Some protesters sang songs like ""The Internationale,"" an anthem employed by both the ruling Communist Party and by protesters, who have used it to suggest that the party has strayed from its ideological roots.",网上流传的视频片段显示，大批人群聚集在武汉中山公园周围，警方试图通过设置路障来拆散他们。当警察试图驱赶人群时，老人们拒绝后退，对着警察的脸大喊。一些抗议者唱着《国际歌》之类的歌曲，这是执政党共产党和抗议者共同使用的赞歌，抗议者用这首歌来暗示共产党偏离其意识形态根源。
"In Wuhan, seven witnesses to the protest and two other residents described what they called a large demonstration during the day. One witness said he had seen police officers roughly detain protesters and lead them away.",在武汉，七名在现场目击了抗议活动的人和另外两名居民描述了当天他们所称的大规模示威活动。一名目击者表示他看到警察粗暴地拘留了抗议者，并将他们带走。
"On Thursday, a couple hundred seniors gathered in groups at the same park at midday, angrily discussing their unhappiness with the health insurance policy changes. Security was tight, with plainclothes officers milling around, filming people as they talked. Nearly 100 uniformed officers stood behind crowd control barriers.",周四，数百名老人于中午时分聚集在同一个公园里，愤怒地讨论他们对医保政策改变的不快。现场安保严格，便衣警察徘徊在周围，在人们说话时对其进行录影。近100名未穿制服的警察站在控制人群的障碍物后面。
"Social frictions in China may be reappearing as economic growth slows and the population ages. China has one of the world's highest levels of income inequality. The protest Wednesday took place near a luxury mall with street-level stores for brands like Dior, Louis Vuitton and Versace.",随着经济增长放缓和人口老龄化，中国的社会摩擦可能会再次出现。中国是世界上收入不平等程度最高的国家之一。周三的抗议活动发生在一个奢侈品购物中心附近，那里有迪奥、路易威登和范思哲等品牌的临街门店。
"The protests were about China's medical insurance system for urban residents. The system consists of two parts: a collective pool of funds and each individual's account. As part of a restructuring of the national health insurance system, local governments are reducing the amount of money deposited into the personal accounts.",抗议针对的是中国城镇居民的医疗保险制度。该系统由两部分组成:集体资金和个人账户。作为国民健康保险制度结构调整的一部分，地方政府正在减少个人账户的存款金额。
Protesters who gathered on Feb. 8 had vowed to return in a week if their demands that the local government restore insurance contributions for retirees to previous levels were not met.,2月7日聚集的抗议者要求当地政府将退休人员的保险缴款恢复到以前的水平，他们誓言，如果这个要求得不到满足，他们将在一周内回来再次抗议。
"The Wuhan government, in a document posted on its website, said that while it was true that the reforms would result in lower payments to everyone's personal insurance accounts, ultimately there would be lower out-of-pocket expenses for certain individuals, because the collective pool would shoulder more of a person's health care costs for routine hospital visits.",武汉市政府在其网站上发布的一份文件中表示，虽然改革确实会降低每个人的个人保险账户支付额，但最终某些个人的自付费用将会降低，因为集体医保资金将承担一个人日常就医的更多医疗费用。
"In addition to the protest in Wuhan, videos also surfaced online on Wednesday of a demonstration of retirees in the port city of Dalian, in Liaoning Province. Last month, a crowd of retirees gathered outside government offices in the southern city of Guangzhou to protest the reduction in government contributions to their personal health insurance accounts, according to videos posted online.",除了武汉的抗议活动，周三网上还出现了辽宁省港口城市大连市退休人员示威的视频。网上发布的视频还显示，上个月，一群退休人员聚集在南方城市广州的政府办公室外，抗议政府减少他们个人医保账户的款项。
"Alfred Wu, an associate professor at National University in Singapore who specializes in political and economic issues in China, said the protesters, many of whom are retired government workers or employees of state-owned companies, were upset at what they saw as a broken promise.",新加坡国立大学专门研究中国政治和经济问题的副教授吴木銮说，抗议者中很多人是退休的政府工作人员或国有企业员工，他们对政府没有兑现承诺感到不满。
"They accepted years of working for low salaries with the expectation that they would receive generous health care and pensions in retirement. Workers in China also expected to retire fairly young by international standards by 50 or 55 for many women and by 55 or 60 for many men, though it is very common for retired older workers to take part-time jobs.",他们接受了多年的低薪工作，期望退休后能得到丰厚的医疗保健和养老金。按照国际标准，中国工人预计退休年龄相当早——许多女性的预计退休年龄为50岁或55岁，许多男性的预计退休年龄为55岁或60岁，尽管退休老年工人从事兼职工作很常见。
"The trade-off on retirement benefits has become increasingly unsustainable in the face of China's looming demographics challenges, in which the number of old people is growing more rapidly than that of young people entering the work force.",面对中国日益逼近的人口结构挑战，退休福利方面的平衡已变得越来越不可持续。在中国，老年人数量的增长速度快于进入劳动力市场的年轻人。
"When Covid struck, local governments had another financial burden: paying for extensive mass testing and quarantine facilities mandated by the central government.",当新冠疫情暴发时，地方政府还有另一个财政负担:支付中央政府授权的大规模检测和隔离设施的费用。
"""The Covid measures accelerated a problem that was already looming on the horizon,"" Mr. Wu said.","""新冠疫情措施加速了一个已经迫在眉睫的问题，""吴木銮说。"
"Local governments across China are facing financial crises. In the mid-1990s, they lost most of their ability to collect taxes because of a government policy change. They were given broad authority instead to borrow money, or to raise money by selling long-term leases of state-owned land to developers.",中国各地的地方政府都面临着财政危机。在20世纪90年代中期，由于政府政策变化，地方政府失去了大部分的征税能力。它们同时被赋予广泛的权力，可以借贷，或通过向开发商出售国有土地的长期租约来筹集资金。
"Sales of land leases boomed, and were equal to roughly 7 percent of the entire economy's output in recent years. Even that money was not enough to pay for local governments' extensive investments in roads, bridges, rail lines, urban parks and other projects. Provinces, cities and towns also borrowed very heavily, often using state-owned enterprises to do so.",土地租售随之蓬勃发展，近年已经大概相当于整个经济产出的7%。然而即使这笔钱也不足以支付地方政府在道路、桥梁、铁路、城市公园和其他项目上的大量投资。各省、市和乡镇还要大量举债，通常是通过国有企业来进行。
"A slow-motion housing crisis since the autumn of 2021 has now disrupted China's model for local government financing. With dozens of developers defaulting on at least some of their debts, they have pulled back sharply from leasing further land. Government revenues from land transfers dropped by nearly a quarter last year.",自2021年秋季以来，一场缓慢发展的房地产危机打乱了中国地方政府的融资模式。由于数十家开发商至少拖欠部分债务，他们已大幅减少了租赁更多土地的计划。去年，政府土地出让收入下降了近四分之一。
"That deprived local governments of money even as their expenses surged because of ""zero Covid"" policies enacted by Beijing.","这使地方政府失去了资金，而由于北京实施的""清零""政策，地方政府的支出还在激增。"
"Caught between falling revenues and rising costs, local governments have responded by delaying pay for civil servants and enacting broad spending cuts. Many local governments in Hebei Province, which surrounds Beijing on three sides, could not even afford to continue heating subsidies for natural gas during the winter, leaving residents to shiver during a record-setting cold wave.",在收入下降和成本上升的夹缝之间，地方政府的应对措施是推迟支付公务员工资，并实施广泛的支出削减。在三面环绕北京的河北省，许多地方政府甚至无力在冬季继续提供天然气取暖补贴，让居民在创纪录的寒潮中瑟瑟发抖。
"Last month, hundreds of workers who had been hired for the government's mass testing programs took to the streets to demand unpaid wages. A month prior, medical students at universities and hospitals, many of whom were pressed into duty as the country's health care system strained to handle a flood of Covid cases, protested for better pay and more protective equipment.",上个月，数百名受雇于政府大规模核酸检测项目的工作人员走上街头，要求支付拖欠的工资。一个月前，大学和医院的医学生举行抗议，要求提高工资和提供更多防护装备。由于该国的医疗保健系统疲于应对大量新冠病例，许多这样的学生被迫上岗。
"China accused the United States on Wednesday of flying high-altitude balloons over the western Chinese regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, pointing the finger at Washington amid growing scrutiny over Beijing's global surveillance efforts.",中国周三指责美国的高空气球飞越中国领空，包括西部的新疆和西藏等地，在人们对北京的全球监控行动进行越来越仔细的审查之际将矛头指向华盛顿。
"China's claim comes two days after it first accused the United States of illegally flying balloons in its airspace, saying American airships had flown over China more than 10 times since the beginning of 2022. The United States denied the claim.",两天前，中国首次提出指责，称自2022年初以来，美国飞艇非法飞越中国领空多达十余次。美国否认了这个说法。
"In another apparent tit-for-tat move, China said it would ""take countermeasures"" against ""relevant American entities"" in response to the United States' blacklisting of six Chinese aerospace companies associated with China's spy balloon program.","中国还表示将对""有关美国实体采取反制措施""，这种明显针锋相对的做法是为了回应美国将与中国间谍气球计划有关的六家中国航空航天公司列入黑名单。"
"Washington and Beijing have been trading barbs for more than two weeks, ever since a sprawling Chinese balloon was spotted over North America. The vessel, which Washington says was used for espionage and Beijing says was mainly used to gather weather data, was eventually shot down on Feb. 4 off the coast of South Carolina, leading to revelations about China's global spy balloon program by American officials.",自从一个巨大的中国气球在北美上空被发现以来，华盛顿与北京交锋已两周有余。华盛顿称这个气球从事间谍活动，北京则说它主要是在收集天气数据。最终，美国于2月4日在南卡罗来纳州海岸将其击落，并披露了中国的全球间谍气球计划。
"Wednesday's accusation citing Xinjiang and Tibet addresses confusion about whether China had been referring to American airships spotted over disputed areas such as Taiwan and parts of the South China Sea that Beijing considers its own territory. The two regions are highly sensitive areas because of their restive ethnic populations, the large presence of military and security forces, and tense border conditions with geopolitical rivals such as India.",中国在周三的指责中提到新疆和西藏，澄清了一个有关中国最初的指责的疑惑，即人们不清楚中国是否指的是美国飞艇飞越台湾或南中国海部分有争议地区上空，中国称对那些地区拥有主权。由于当地少数民族人口对中国的统治不满，新疆和西藏都属于高度敏感地区，驻扎着大量军队和安全部队，与印度等地缘政治对手的边境还存在着紧张局势。
"China initially expressed regret for the appearance of its balloon over the United States, explaining it had flown off course. Its tone changed after the craft was downed by a missile from an American fighter jet, a response Beijing has repeatedly described as an ""overreaction.""","中国对气球在美国上空出现最初曾表示遗憾，解释那是因为气球被风吹离了航线。一架美国战斗机用导弹将气球击落后，中国的口吻发生了变化，北京多次把美国的反应称之为""反应过度""。"
"China did not explain whether it discovered the American balloons while they were still in the air or after looking at older radar data. It's also unclear if China previously notified the United States about their presence. A spokesman for the foreign ministry said on Wednesday that China responded in ""a calm and professional manner"" in contrast to the United States' decision to down China's balloon.","中国没有解释自己是如何发现美国气球的，究竟是在气球仍在空中还是回顾了旧的雷达数据后才发现的。也不清楚中国以前是否将相关情况通报给了美国。中国外交部发言人周三表示，中国对美国气球""作出冷静、专业处置""，与美国击落中国气球的决定形成鲜明对比。"
"""Reflect on yourself, stop smearing and attacking China, and stop misleading the American people and the international community. China reserves the right to make further necessary reactions,"" said Wang Wenbin, a ministry spokesman.","美国应该""反躬自省，停止对中方的抹黑攻击，停止误导美国民众和国际社会。中方保留作出进一步必要反应的权利""，外交部发言人汪文斌说。"
"Analysts say China is trying to deflect criticism for its surveillance balloons, which have been spotted in other parts of the world, including Taiwan, Latin America and the Middle East.",分析人士称，中国正试图转移外界对其侦察气球的批评，世界其他地区也发现过这些侦察气球，包括台湾、拉丁美洲和中东。
"""China is scrambling to spin the crisis,"" said Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. ""The shoot-down has put them on the back foot. They didn't expect the whole incident to get so much attention both domestically and internationally. They're looking for some claim to make it seem like they're not in the wrong.""","""中国正在急于扭转这场危机的叙事，""新加坡国立大学政治学副教授庄嘉颖说。""气球被击落已让他们处于不利地位。他们没想到整个事件会在国内外引起如此大的关注。他们正在寻找一些说法，让他们看起来不是责任方。"""
"In line with that effort, China has spent days ramping up anti-American rhetoric and suggesting that President Biden had been pressured to shoot down the balloon to boost his approval ratings and fend off attacks from Republican critics.",为了配合该努力，中国连日来加强了反美言论，暗示拜登总统是迫于压力才将气球击落的，是为了提高他的支持率，避开共和党批评者的攻击。
"The growing spat has upended what had been a slow and steady thaw in relations that started in November when Mr. Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met face to face at the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia.",自去年11月拜登与中国国家主席习近平在印尼巴厘岛的G20峰会上会晤以来，美中关系开始缓慢而稳定的解冻，这场不断升级的争吵已经破坏了这种趋势。
Tensions are now ratcheting up following a weekend in which American warplanes shot down three unidentified flying objects over North America. Early indications suggest the objects were harmless and likely did not belong to China.,美国战机上周末在北美上空击落了三个不明飞行物后，紧张局势正在加剧。初步迹象表明这些物体是无害的，很可能不属于中国。
"While many in the world see the Chinese spy balloon as a sign of Beijing's growing aggressiveness, China has sought to cast the controversy as a symptom of the United States' irrevocable decline.",虽然世界上许多人将中国的间谍气球视为北京越来越好斗的迹象，但中国却试图将这场争议说成是美国不可逆转的衰落的征兆。
"Why else would a great power be spooked by a flimsy inflatable craft, China has argued, if not for a raft of internal problems like an intensely divided society and intractable partisan strife driving President Biden to act tough on Beijing?",中国提出质疑，如果不是因为美国国内存在严重的社会分裂和难以应对的党派斗争等大量问题，迫使拜登总统对中国采取强硬做法的话，一个强大的国家怎么会被一个薄而易破的充气飞艇吓到?
"The balloon incident ""has shown to the world how immature and irresponsible indeed hysterical the United States has been in dealing with the case,"" read a recent editorial in the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's mouthpiece.","气球事件""向世界表明，美国在处理这件事上不成熟、不负责任，其实是歇斯底里""，中共的英文报纸《中国日报》在最近的一篇社论中写道。"
"Chinese propaganda has tried to score points against the Biden administration, mocking it as flailing, overreacting and trying to outflank its hard-right Republican opponents to demonstrate who can stand taller against Beijing. Nowhere in China's response has the government acknowledged the balloon's cost to its own credibility and the mounting evidence that it was all too willing to spy on its neighbors and beyond.",中国试图在宣传中驳倒拜登政府，嘲笑其不知所措、反应过度，想方设法胜过极右派的共和党对手，以证明自己在面对中国时更昂首挺胸。中国政府在回应中丝毫不承认气球事件给自己的信誉造成了损失，以及有越来越多的证据显示，中国实在太愿意监视邻国和更远的地方了。
"Instead, on Tuesday, China sought to show it had already moved on from the incident. Much of the country's messaging tended to strategic interests elsewhere in the world. China's ambassador to France, Lu Shaye, spoke of shoring up ties with the European Union to break the grip of U.S. influence within the bloc. And China welcomed Iran's hard-line president, Ebrahim Raisi, to Beijing, where he'll meet with China's top leader, Xi Jinping, in a sign of the two countries' shared vision of a more multipolar world, free of Washington's dominance.",中国反而在周二寻求展示自己已不再提气球事件这个话题。中国的大部分信息传递往往针对的是它在世界其他地方的战略利益。中国驻法国大使卢沙野谈到加强与欧盟的关系，以打破美国对欧盟成员国的影响。中国欢迎伊朗强硬派总统莱希访问北京，他将与中国最高领导人习近平见面，这表明两国对一个更加多极化的、不受华盛顿支配的世界有共同的愿景。
"Mr. Xi underscored that point last week when he delivered a speech at the Central Party School in which he proclaimed that ""Chinese-style modernization"" was a new model for human advancement that dispelled the notion that ""modernization is equal to Westernization.""","习近平上周在中央党校发表讲话时强调了这一点，他在讲话中宣称""中国式现代化""是人类进步的新模式，打破了""现代化=西方化""的观念。"
"The speech echoed more subtly the steady drumbeat of anti-American rhetoric that has filled the opinion sections of Chinese state media since the balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Feb. 4. China has asserted that the United States overreacted by downing the balloon, which the Chinese insist was a civilian airship that was blown off course. American officials say the vessel belonged to a vast Chinese surveillance program designed to collect information on the military capabilities of countries around the world.",习近平的话比中国官媒评论栏目上的反美言论说得更委婉一些。自从中国气球2月4日在南卡罗来纳州海岸被击落以来，官媒上一直充斥着这种言论。中国一直坚称，美国击落气球是反应过度，气球是民用飞艇，被风吹离了航线。美国官员则表示，该飞艇属于一个庞大的监视计划，该计划旨在收集有关世界各国的军事能力信息。
"Tensions heated up over the weekend, with the U.S. shooting down three unidentified flying objects over North America and China announcing it would down a mysterious craft near the Bohai Sea. It marked a moment of geopolitical brinkmanship amid deepening concerns about the trajectory of the relationship between China and the United States, now at its lowest point in decades.",紧张局势已在周末升级。美国击落了北美上空出现的三个不明飞行物，中国宣布准备击落渤海附近上空的一个不明飞行物。这标志着地缘政治走向边缘政策的时刻，中美关系已经在越来越令人担忧地下滑，现在到了几十年来的最低点。
At the heart of that disquiet are questions about the ability of each country's leadership to manage nationalistic sentiment and steer the two powers away from a collision course.,这种不安的要害在于双方领导人应对国内民族主义情绪、设法让两个大国避免冲突的能力问题。
"As China's most ardent nationalist leader in generations, Mr. Xi can't be seen bowing to U.S. pressure without undermining his core promise to the Chinese people of rejuvenating the nation, a project he frames in civilizational terms as the East rising and the West declining.","习近平是中国几代人来最具民族主义色彩的领导人，他不能被人视为在美国压力下让步，那会破坏他向中国人民做出的核心承诺——实现民族伟大复兴，他已把这个愿景表达为""东升西降""的社会文明走向。"
That gives Mr. Xi little room to project anything but toughness over the balloon.,这让习近平在气球事件上除了展现强硬外，几乎没有其他选择余地。
"""Because of the propaganda in recent years, it is not possible for China to make concessions or apologize to the United States. Chinese people cannot accept a weak attitude from their government,"" said Xing Yue, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing.","""由于近年来的宣传，中国不可能向美国做出让步或道歉。中国人民不能接受来自本国政府的软弱态度，""北京清华大学国际关系教授邢悦说。"
"China's tone has shifted markedly in recent days. After at first uncharacteristically expressing regret for the balloon that emerged over Montana, China accused the United States of waging ""information and public opinion warfare."" This week, Beijing said that high-altitude American balloons had flown over Chinese airspace on more than 10 occasions since May of last year, a claim the White House immediately denied.","中国的口吻已在最近几天发生了明显变化。气球在蒙大拿州上空出现后，中国最初曾不同寻常地表示了遗憾，但后来却指责美国发动""信息和舆论战""。中国政府本周称，自去年5月以来，美国的高空气球已飞越中国领空十余次，白宫马上否认了这个说法。"
"On Tuesday, Wang Wenbin, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, doubled down, asserting that the Pentagon has spent billions of dollars in developing high-altitude reconnaissance balloons and has transitioned those projects to military services. He accused the United States of using excessive force in shooting the balloon down. ""The U.S. needs to be careful not pull a muscle while flexing so hard,"" he said.","周二，中国外交部发言人汪文斌变本加厉地断言，五角大楼已在研发高空侦察气球上花了数十亿美元，并且已将这些项目转化为军事应用。他指责美国击落气球是过度使用武力。""提醒美方，小心用力过猛闪了腰，""他说。"
Chinese state media has drawn attention to partisan divisions within the United States. It has suggested that the Biden administration shot down the airship to improve the president's approval ratings and because he had been criticized by Republican lawmakers for not taking action sooner.,中国官媒一直在强调美国国内的党派分歧。官媒暗示，拜登政府决定击落飞艇是为了提高总统的支持率，因为国会中的共和党议员们批评他没有及早采取行动。
"""The Biden administration's decisions on the balloon episode were hijacked by U.S. domestic politics,"" the People's Daily said in an editorial.","""拜登政府在气球事件上的决定为美国国内政治所裹挟，""《人民日报》发表的一篇社评写道。"
"That view isn't restricted to state propaganda; it's also held by more measured voices in the nation's foreign policy community, such as Zheng Yongnian, an influential political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, who has warned that rising nationalism in the United States will likely give rise to more nationalism in China.",这个观点不只出现在政府的宣传中，也是中国外交政策界更慎重的人的看法，例如香港中文大学(深圳)有影响力的政治学家郑永年，他警告称，美国国内的民族主义情绪增长可能会引发中国更多的民族主义情绪。
"""The No. 1 global risk today is U.S. domestic politics,"" said Mr. Zheng, who has served as an adviser to senior officials. Unlike more strident commentators in China, Mr. Zheng disagrees that the United States is in structural decline.","""当今的全球头号风险是美国国内政治，""郑永年说，他曾担任高级官员的顾问。与中国更强硬的评论员不同，郑永年不赞同美国处于结构性衰退的说法。"
"""The U.S. still has strong governance, it's still the richest country and it still has the biggest military,"" Mr. Zheng said. But when he looks to Washington, he said, he sees a president straining to balance his desire to find common ground with Beijing and his need to stand firm against China.","""美国仍有强大的治理能力，仍是最富裕的国家，仍拥有最强大的军队，""郑永年说。但他说，当他把目光转向华盛顿时，他看到的是一位尽力保持平衡的总统，他有与中国政府找到共同点的愿望，也有在对抗中国上坚定不移的需要。"
"In a political climate where hawkish views on China are being embraced by both parties, lawmakers could face growing pressure to demonstrate their resolve to confront Beijing. The Biden administration, for example, is accused of being soft on China by Republicans, despite frustrating Beijing by banning exports of critical semiconductor technology to China and by bolstering military ties with allies in the region, including Japan, the Philippines and Australia.",美国的两党人士都接受了对华的鹰派观点，在这种政治气候下，议员们面临着越来越大的压力要去展示与北京对抗的决心。例如，共和党人指责拜登政府对中国态度软弱，尽管美国政府已采取了令北京不满的做法，包括禁止向中国出口关键半导体技术，以及加强与日本、菲律宾和澳大利亚等亚太地区盟友的军事联系。
"Mr. Zheng said China should avoid conflict with the United States and find areas of cooperation, such as combating climate change and supporting global health initiatives, that could reduce tension.",郑永年表示，中国应该避免与美国发生冲突，并寻找可以缓解紧张局势的合作领域，例如应对气候变化、支持全球卫生倡议。
"That could be difficult if Kevin McCarthy, the new House speaker, follows through on a suggestion he would visit Taiwan, risking a repeat of the massive military exercises China conducted when the former speaker, Nancy Pelosi, traveled to the self-governing island last year.",但这样做可能会变得困难，如果新任众议院议长麦卡锡把以前的一个暗示付诸行动的话——他曾表示上任后会访问台湾，这有引发中国再次进行大规模军事演习的风险，众议院前议长佩洛西去年访问了自治的台湾后，中国就这么做过。
"Another potential flash point could take place in the spring, when Mr. Xi is expected to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow. China has tacitly supported the war in Ukraine.",另一个潜在的爆发点可能在今年春季，预计习近平那时将在莫斯科与俄罗斯总统普京会面。中国一直在暗中支持俄罗斯对乌克兰的战争。
"Analysts say there's still room for the United States and China to stabilize ties. Mr. Blinken and Wang Yi, China's top foreign policy official, will both attend the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, which begins Friday. While no meeting between the two has been scheduled, Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, said administration officials were ""committed to keeping lines of communication open"" between Washington and Beijing.","分析人士称，美中仍有稳定关系的余地。美国国务卿布林肯和中国最高外交政策官员王毅都将出席本周五在德国举行的年度慕尼黑安全会议。虽然尚未安排两人会面，但美国国务院发言人内德·普莱斯说，政府官员""致力于保持(华盛顿与北京之间)沟通渠道的畅通""。"
"It is harder for China to send such signals because most of its public messaging is crafted with a domestic audience in mind. Still, there are strong incentives for Beijing to lower the temperature, none more urgent than the need to revive an economy battered by years of stringent Covid restrictions.","让中国发出这种信号会更难，因为它公开传递的大部分信息都是针对国内受众的。尽管如此，中国政府仍有缓解紧张局势的强烈动机，其中最紧迫的莫过于重振这几年受到严厉的新冠""清零""政策打击的经济。"
"In a speech last week at the U.S.-China Business Council, Xu Xueyuan, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the United States, said she hoped the balloon incident will not discourage American businesses from investing in China.",中国驻美国大使馆临时代办徐学渊上周在美中贸易全国委员会发表讲话时表示，她希望气球事件不会阻碍美国企业在中国的投资。
"""This incident shouldn't be allowed to offset the efforts we have put in place in stabilizing bilateral relations,"" Ms. Xu said, according to a foreign ministry statement.","根据外交部的一则消息，徐学渊说:""不应让这一事件抵消了双方在维护两国关系稳定方面所作的努力。"""
"The question now is which country will offer an olive branch first. Any such gesture comes at the risk of appearing to accommodate the other side. China is finding it hard to appear strong without further inflaming tensions with the United States, said Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former National Security Council director for China. ""When forced to choose, they will prioritize their domestic audience over external audiences,"" he said.","现在的问题是哪个国家会先伸出橄榄枝。任何这种姿态都有让一方在对方眼里显得愿意迁就的风险。布鲁金斯学会高级研究员、曾在美国国家安全委员会任中国事务主任的何瑞恩(Ryan Hass)表示，中国正在发现，很难在不进一步加剧与美国紧张关系的情况下显得强大。""他们在被迫做出选择时会优先考虑国内受众，而不是外部受众，""他说。"
"""Above all, though, I sense that the Chinese are eager to move on,"" he said. ""They would like to put the spy balloon issue behind them without appearing to offer any concessions in the process.""","""不过，最重要的是，我觉得中国人急于想换个话题，""他说。""他们想把间谍气球的问题置于脑后，但不想在这个过程中给人做出了任何让步的印象。"""
"In 2019, years before a hulking high-altitude Chinese balloon floated across the United States and caused widespread alarm, one of China's top aeronautics scientists made a proud announcement that received little attention back then: his team had launched an airship more than 60,000 feet into the air and sent it sailing around most of the globe, including across North America.",在2019年——中国的一个巨型高空气球飘越美国、引起广泛恐慌的几年前，中国航空航天科学领域的一名领军人物就曾自豪地宣布，他的团队将一艘飞艇送上了2万米高空，完成了环绕地球大部分地区的飞行，其中包括北美洲。这条消息当时并没有引起太多注意。
"The scientist, Wu Zhe, told a state-run news outlet at the time that the ""Cloud Chaser"" airship was a milestone in his vision of populating the upper reaches of the earth's atmosphere with steerable balloons that could be used to provide early warnings of natural disasters, monitor pollution or carry out airborne surveillance.","这位名叫武哲的科学家当时对一家官方新闻媒体说，""追云号""飞艇是他实现将大量可操纵气球送入地球平流层愿景的一个里程碑，平流层飞艇的应用领域包括各种灾情预警、环境污染监控，以及空中侦察。"
"""Look, there's America,"" Professor Wu said in an accompanying video, pointing on a computer screen to a red line that appeared to trace the airship's path across Asia, northern Africa, and near the southern edge of the United States. By the time of the report, it was over the Pacific Ocean.","""看，那是美国，""武哲在报道附带的视频中说，他指着电脑屏幕上的一条红线，它似乎记录了那艘飞艇飞越亚洲、非洲北部，以及靠近美国南部边境的路径。那篇报道发表的时候，飞艇已到了太平洋上空。"
"Professor Wu's announcement is part of a body of evidence revealing in new detail the scope of the Chinese government's ambitions to use high-altitude airships to track earthbound activities, with an eye on both domestic and military needs. Chinese media reports, academic studies and officials' speeches suggest that Professor Wu has been central to China's balloon development efforts.",有大量证据表明，出于国内的和军事上的需求，中国政府一直寻求利用高空飞艇跟踪地面活动，而武哲的宣布是这些证据的一部分，揭示了中国气球项目涉及范围的新细节。中国的媒体报道、学术研究以及官员的讲话表明，武哲在中国的气球研发努力中起到了核心作用。
"A senior academic at Beihang University, a Beijing-based institution at the forefront of China's aviation and space research, Professor Wu has also worked in airship development for nearly two decades. Now several of his companies have been caught up in the Biden administration's efforts to counter those plans. Professor Wu has been a founder or major stakeholder in at least three of the six Chinese entities that Washington punished last week for their involvement in what the Biden administration calls Beijing's surveillance balloon program.",武哲是北京航空航天大学的资深学者，该校处于中国航空航天研究的前沿。他从事飞艇研制工作已近20年。他的几家公司现已卷入拜登政府打击中国气球计划的行动。美国商业部上周惩罚了六家中国公司，因为它们参与了拜登政府所说的中国监视气球计划，武哲是其中至少三家公司的创始人或大股东。
Washington did not say whether any of blacklisted entities was specifically linked to the Chinese balloon that was discovered and shot down over the United States this month. Nor has it singled out Professor Wu by name. Emails and calls to Professor Wu's office went unanswered on Monday.,华盛顿没有说明被列入黑名单的实体与本月在美国上空被发现和击落的中国气球有哪些具体联系，也没有提到武哲的名字。记者周一给武哲办公室发的电子邮件没有得到回复，打去的电话也无人接听。
"China has maintained that the Chinese balloon was a civilian airship that was conducting mostly meteorological research when it was blown off course. On Monday, Beijing pointed its finger at Washington, saying that the United States has flown high-altitude balloons over Chinese airspace more than 10 times since last year.",中国坚称，美国击落的中国气球是一艘被风吹离航线的民用飞艇，主要是在进行气象研究。周一，北京将矛头指向华盛顿，称自去年以来，美国的高空气球已10多次飘越中国领空。
"Professor Wu, who turns 66 this month, has emerged as a central figure in China's ambitions in ""near space,"" the band of the atmosphere between 12 and 62 miles above earth that is too high for most planes to stay aloft for long and too low for space satellites.","本月将满66岁的武哲已经成为中国实现""临近空间""雄心壮志的核心人物，""临近空间""指的是距离地面20至50公里左右的大气层，大多数飞机不能在这种高空长时间飞行，但这种高度对卫星来说又太低。"
"He has helped design jet fighters, developed expertise in stealth materials, won prizes for his work from the Chinese military and was a vice president of Beihang University before deciding to return to research and teaching. He also sat on an advisory committee to the now-disbanded General Armaments Department of the People's Liberation Army, according to his biography on the Beihang University website.",武哲曾帮助设计喷气式战斗机，有研发隐形材料方面的专长，他的工作还曾获得过中国军方的嘉奖。他曾任北航副校长，后来主动辞去职务，以集中精力从事教学和研究工作。据武哲在北航网站上的简历，他还是中国人民解放军总装备部顾问委员会的委员，这个机关如今已不存在。
"Chinese strategists see near space as an arena of deepening great-power rivalry, where China must master the new materials and technologies needed to establish a firm presence, or risk being edged out. That anxiety has deepened as relations with the United States have soured under Xi Jinping, China's resolutely nationalist leader. Near space, Chinese analysts argue, offers a potentially useful alternative to satellites and surveillance planes, which may become vulnerable to detection, blocking or attacks.",中国的战略家们将临近空间视为深化大国竞争的领域，中国必须掌握在这个领域建立稳固存在所需的新材料和新技术，否则就有被淘汰的风险。随着中美关系在中国坚定的民族主义领导人习近平的领导下恶化，这种焦虑已随之加剧。中国分析人士认为，在卫星以及也许更容易被探测、拦截或攻击的侦察机之外，临近空间提供了可供选择的有用空域。
"Near space ""is a major sphere of competition between the 21st century military powers,"" Shi Hong, a Chinese military commentator wrote in a current affairs journal last year. ""Whoever gains the edge in near space vehicles will be able to win more of the initiative in future wars.""","临近空间""是21世纪世界军事强国竞争的重要领域""，中国军事评论员石宏去年在一份时事杂志上写道。""谁能在临近空间飞行器方面取得优势，谁也就能在未来战争中掌握更大的主动权。"""
"Until recently, China's long-distance high-altitude balloon flights drew little attention, perhaps partly a testament to their success in staying off the radars of foreign governments.",直到最近，中国高空气球的长距离飞行几乎没有引起外界的太多注意，这也许部分证明了它们在避开外国政府视线方面的成功。
"The Biden administration now says that China has sent them over more than 40 countries and that the United States was only able to detect the flights by reviewing stored data. Now, the U.S. military is adjusting its radars to try to spot more incursions. Over the weekend, U.S. fighter jets shot down three unidentified flying objects over Alaska, Canada and Michigan.",拜登政府现在表示，中国已将高空气球派到了40多个国家上空，而美国只是在综合了以前存下来的数据后才侦查到这些气球。现在，美国军方正在对其雷达系统进行调整，试图发现更多的入侵气球。上周末，美国战斗机分别在阿拉斯加、加拿大和密歇根上空击落了三个不明飞行器。
"High-altitude balloons are made of special materials that can cope with the harsh extremes of temperatures and carry loads in thin air. For the balloons to be useful, operators on earth must be able to stay in touch with them across vast distances. Professor Wu's open academic publications and other reports indicate that he and his scientific collaborators have long studied these challenges.",高空气球采用可应对恶劣极端温度、在稀薄空气中承载负荷的特殊材料制成。为了让气球发挥作用，地球上的操作员必须能够在很远的距离之外与其保持联系。武哲公开发表的学术文章和其他报告表明，他和他的学术合作者们长期以来一直在研究这些挑战。
"The balloon that was launched in July 2019, Professor Wu said then, was a ""big guy,"" nearly 330 feet in length and weighing several tons, which appears to be bigger than the balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina by an American fighter jet this month. ""This is the first time that an aerodynamically controlled airship has flown around the world in the stratosphere at 20,000 meters,"" or about 65,000 feet high, Professor Wu told an outlet of the Southern Daily newspaper of Guangdong Province.","""追云号""飞艇是2019年7月起飞的，武哲当时对记者说，它是个""长约百米、重达几吨的'大家伙'""，似乎比美国战斗机本月在南卡罗来纳州海岸击落的中国气球要大。""这是人类首次在2万米高空，使用空气动力控制的平流层飞艇环球飞行，""武哲在《南方日报》的报道中说。"
"The 2019 flight was not a one-off for Professor Wu and his team. The Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group, or EMAST, a Beijing-based company that Professor Wu co-founded in 2004, has claimed a series of other successes for them.",2019年的高空气球飞行不只是武哲和他的团队的唯一一次。武哲在2004年与他人一起在北京成立的铱格斯曼航空科技集团股份有限公司宣称进行了一系列成功的气球飞行。
"Advances in high-altitude balloons held out the potential for ""high resolution, long-lasting, stable communications, reconnaissance, navigation and other services,"" EMAST said on its official WeChat social media account in 2017.","高空气球的发展""为指定区域实现高精度、长时间、稳定的通信、侦察及导航等服务""提供了可能，铱格斯曼2017年在其官方微信社交媒体帐户上写道。"
"In 2019, Professor Wu and his team ""acquired a signal from between earth and near space"" for the first time, EMAST said. The company did not explain what kind of signals were involved, nor whether the step was linked to the ""Cloud Catcher"" flight of that year or another airship. The company's website has been offline recently, but cached records of its web pages can still be found online.","铱格斯曼称，武哲和他的团队在2019年""首次实现临近空间对地信号获取""，但没有解释所涉及的信号，也没有解释获取是否与""追云号""当年的飞行有关，还是与另一艘飞艇有关。这家公司的网站最近已经下线，但其网页缓存仍可在网上找到。"
"In 2020, a Chinese balloon made a full circumnavigation of the globe and was safely retrieved, a pioneering feat, EMAST said. In the following year, the team operated two of the balloons in the skies simultaneously, a first for the project.",一个中国气球已在2020年完成了绕地球飞行并被安全收回，铱格斯曼称其为开创性的壮举。次年，武哲的团队将两个高空气球同时放入天空，这对他们来说是首次。
"In 2022, the cached EMAST web pages say, Professor Wu and his team either launched or planned to launch the Chinese wording on the timing is unclear three high-altitude balloons in the air at the same time to form an ""airborne network."" The ultimate goal, the company said, was to create an airborne signals network in China using stationary balloons floating at least 80,000 feet high.","据缓存的铱格斯曼网页称，武哲及其团队的战略目标包括在2022年实现""三套以上某型飞艇在空组网""，这个目标是否实现无从可知。公司称，最终目标是用位于20公里高空的静态平流层气球建成中国的""全球临近空间信息网络建设""。"
"It likened the planned network to Starlink, the system of small, low-orbiting satellites operated by SpaceX. Starlink has provided communications support to Ukrainian forces fighting Russian invaders. By 2028, EMAST said, it hoped to ""complete a global near-space information network,"" but did not elaborate on what that meant.","公司将计划中的网络比作""星链""，这个由SpaceX运营的小型低轨道卫星系统已为与俄罗斯入侵者作战的乌克兰军队提供通信支持。铱格斯曼表示希望在2028年完成""全球临近空间信息网络建设""，但没有详细说明这意味着什么。"
"There has been no public corroboration of Professor Wu's claimed successes with high-altitude balloons. His available scientific papers do not describe any of those feats. Nonetheless, Professor Wu is a highly awarded scientist whose views carry official weight.",对武哲声称的高空气球成功飞行没有其他的公开确证。他公开发表的科学论文中没有任何对这些成功的描述。尽管如此，武哲是一名屡获殊荣的科学家，他的说法具有官方重要性。
"In 2015, the Communist Party's newspaper, People's Daily, hailed the work of Professor Wu and his team after they launched a balloon in northern China that stayed aloft at more than 65,000 feet. That was a breakthrough for China in developing the materials and knowledge for long-endurance near-space voyages, the reports said.",2015年，中共党报《人民日报》发表了中国首个高空气球在中国北方试飞成功的报道，对武哲及其团队送入20公里高的飞艇大为称赞。报道说，这是中国在研发可长期在临近空间航行或留驻的气球所需材料和知识方面取得的一项突破。
"The team had ""pioneered a new path for developing near-space flying craft,"" Zhang Jun, the Communist Party secretary of Beihang University, said in a meeting in 2015. Mr. Zhang urged them to go further, ""focusing on national strategic needs.""","北航党委书记张军曾在2015年的一次会议上说，武哲的团队已""探索出一条临近空间飞行器发展的新型道路""。张军要求团队""围绕国家战略需求""取得更大成就。"
"Professor Wu appeared eager to expand his footprint in the commercial realm. That same year, he began preparations to found a campus of Beihang University in Dongguan, a manufacturing and technology city over 1,000 miles south of Beijing. He was also involved in several companies looking to turn his and his research partners' work into commercial applications, corporate records indicate.",武哲似乎也热衷于将他足迹扩大到商业领域。同样是在2015年，他开始筹备在北京以南约2000公里的制造业和科技城市东莞成立北京航空航天大学分校。企业注册记录显示，他还参与成立了几家公司，希望将他和研究伙伴的工作转化为商业用途。
"In partnership with a Shanghai property company, he helped to found Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology, a company that described itself as being focused on ""near space"" technology. That company, as well as Eagles Men Aviation and another company he created, Shanxi Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group, were among the six entities the Department of Commerce imposed sanctions upon last week. Calls to his companies went unanswered on Monday.","武哲与上海一家房地产公司合作，帮助成立了北京南江空天科技股份有限公司，专门从事""临近空间飞行器及其应用产品的研究开发""。这家公司和铱格斯曼，还有武哲创建的另一家公司——山西铱格斯曼航空科技有限公司，都在被美国商务部上周制裁的六家中国实体名单上。周一打给武哲公司的电话无人接听。"
"Until perhaps recently, Professor Wu appeared to show no misgivings about revealing his corporate links. In 2021, he and his partners announced that they were applying to list shares of Eagles Men Aviation on a new stock exchange in Beijing. The announcement noted the military demand for the company's concealment products, including camouflage and stealth materials to help aircraft evade detection.",直到不久前，武哲似乎对披露他和企业的关系尚未有任何顾虑。他和他的合伙人曾在2021年宣布，正在启动铱格斯曼在北京新成立的证券交易所上市的申请。公告指出，公司主要从事飞机隐身器材、飞机隐身性能监测等满足军方隐身需求的产品研制、生产与销售。
"In the latest jab over aerial surveillance, China said on Monday that high-altitude balloons from the United States had flown over Chinese airspace without permission more than 10 times since the start of last year.",关于气球事件，中国发起了新的反击，该国在周一表示，自去年年初以来，美国的高空气球在未经许可的情况下逾十次飞越中国领空。
"Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesman, said that it was a ""common occurrence"" for U.S. high-altitude balloons to ""illegally enter the airspace of other countries,"" while providing no further details.","外交部发言人汪文斌表示，美国高空气球""非法进入别国领空司空见惯""，但没有提供更多细节。"
"China's claims were swiftly rejected by the United States. ""Any claim that the U.S. government operates surveillance balloons over the P.R.C. is false,"" said Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, referring to the People's Republic of China.","中国的说法被美国迅速否认。""任何所谓美国政府在中华人民共和国上空出动监视气球的说法都是错误的，""美国国家安全委员会发言人阿德里安娜·沃森说。"
"""This is the latest example of China scrambling to do damage control,"" Ms. Watson said in a statement.","""这是中国手忙脚乱进行危机公关的最新例子，""沃森在一份声明中说。"
"In Beijing, Mr. Wang, the Chinese spokesman, reiterated Beijing's position that the Chinese balloon that floated over the United States this month before being shot down was a civilian airship that had accidentally strayed into American airspace. U.S. officials called it a surveillance craft.",在北京，发言人汪文斌重申了中国政府的立场，即本月飘到美国上空然后被击落的气球是一艘误入美国领空的民用气球。美国官员则称其为监视气球。
"Mr. Wang urged the United States ""to reflect on itself and mend its ways, instead of slandering, smearing or inciting confrontation.""","汪文斌敦促美方""反躬自省、改弦更张，而不是到处污蔑抹黑、煽动对抗""。"
"The comments, made at a news briefing by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, followed a busy weekend of aerial theatrics as U.S. fighter jets shot down three unidentified flying objects over North America. American officials are still uncertain about what the objects were, who sent them and what purpose they were meant to serve.",他是在中国外交部的例行记者会上发表上述言论的，此前的周末，戏剧性事件不断上演，美国战斗机在北美上空击落了三个不明飞行物。美国官员仍然不确定这些物体是什么、被谁派来的，以及它们的用途是什么。
"Asked about the unidentified objects that the United States shot down, Mr. Wang, the foreign ministry spokesman, said he was unaware of the situation.",当被问及美国击落的不明物体时，外交部发言人汪文斌表示他不了解。
"In China, the local authorities near a northern port city said on Sunday that they had spotted their own unidentified flying object and were prepared to shoot it down, according to Chinese state-owned media.",据中国官方媒体报道，在中国一北方港口城市附近的地方当局周日表示，他们也发现了不明飞行物，并准备将其击落。
"A local government marine agency warned nearby fishing boats to be careful of possible falling debris, the report said. But as of Monday afternoon in Beijing, there was no official announcement about the object or whether authorities had fired at it.",报道称，当地海洋管理机构警告附近的渔船注意避险。但截至北京时间周一下午，没有关于该物体或当局将其击落的官方公告。
"President Biden ordered the U.S. military to shoot down the Chinese balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Feb. 4, a few days after it was spotted hovering over Montana.",2月4日，拜登总统下令美军在南卡罗来纳州海岸击落中国气球，几天前有人发现它在蒙大拿州上空徘徊。
"The balloon's discovery prompted Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken to cancel a planned visit to Beijing over what he called an ""irresponsible act."" A senior administration official said the craft had flown over sensitive military sites in the United States and Canada.","气球的发现促使国务院布林肯取消了计划中的访华行程，他称气球为""不负责任的行为""。一位高级政府官员说，该飞行器飞越了美国和加拿大的敏感军事地点。"
"Days after that balloon was shot down, China acknowledged that a second Chinese balloon had been floating over Latin America and the Caribbean. As it had in the case of the balloon over Montana, the Chinese foreign ministry said that the second airship was civilian in nature, had also been affected by the weather and had ""deviated far from its planned course.""","在该气球被击落几天后，中国承认飘浮在拉丁美洲和加勒比地区上空的另一个气球也是该国的。正如在蒙大拿州上空的气球事件一样，中国外交部表示，第二个气球也是民用飞艇，也受到了天气的影响，""偏离了原计划的航向""。"
"The United States had said that the second balloon was another Chinese surveillance balloon. The Colombian Air Force said it had tracked the object until it left the country's airspace, adding that officials determined it did not pose a threat to national security.",美国曾表示，第二个气球也是是中国的侦察气球。哥伦比亚空军表示，它一直在追踪该物体，直到它离开该国领空，并补充说，官员们确定它不会对国家安全构成威胁。
"BEIJING Since the spy balloon saga started, China has tried to play down the incident, maintaining that the United States is overreacting and that the vessel is mainly for gathering meteorological data.",北京——自间谍气球事件开始以来，中国一直试图淡化这件事，坚称美国反应过度，该无人飞艇主要是用于收集气象数据。
"But as American alarm and accusations have mounted about a broad surveillance program by Beijing, that strategy is increasingly coming under strain, forcing China into an awkward, at times self-contradictory position. Beijing is also starting to adopt a more confrontational tone, further raising the specter of escalation.",但随着美国对中国政府的广泛监视计划的警告和指责越来越多，后者面临的压力也越来越大，迫使其陷入一种尴尬的、有时甚至自相矛盾的境地。北京也开始采取更具对抗性的口吻，进一步加剧了升级风险。
"A foreign ministry spokeswoman on Friday accused the United States of using ""pure political manipulation"" against China. Earlier in the week, China rebuffed an American request for a phone call between the two countries' defense ministers. A Chinese diplomat said that even if U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken had visited Beijing this week Mr. Blinken scrapped the visit because of the balloon it would not have done any good for bilateral relations.","中国外交部发言人上周五指责美国在气球事件上的做法""纯属政治操弄""。上周早些时候，中国拒绝了美国提出的两国防长的通话建议。一名中国外交官说，即使美国国务卿布林肯上周访问了中国，也不会对双边关系带来任何好处。布林肯因气球事件取消了访问行程。"
"""I think we're past the stage"" of the incident not becoming a big deal, Drew Thompson, a former U.S. Defense Department official on China, said of the Chinese attempts to minimize fallout. Mr. Thompson is now a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.","""我认为我们已经过了""不让事态变大的阶段，曾在美国国防部担任中国问题官员的唐安竹(Drew Thompson)在谈到中国试图将影响降到最低时说。唐安竹现在是新加坡李光耀公共政策学院的高级访问学者。"
"China's inconsistent messaging was feeding tensions even if that was not the direct goal, Mr. Thompson continued. He pointed to Beijing's vague attribution of the balloon to an unspecified civilian company, and its claim that its wayward trajectory was an isolated mistake a claim seemingly undermined by the revelation of a second Chinese balloon over Latin America.",尽管不是其直接目的，但中国不一致的信息传递加剧了紧张局势，唐安竹继续说道。他指出，中国政府说气球属于一家未披露名字的民用企业，并声称气球飞行方向失控是个孤立的错误，但这个说法似乎已被拉丁美洲上空发现的第二个中国气球所削弱。
"""Unnamed companies, disingenuous statements, essentially a lack of credible messaging from Beijing drive a degree of discomfort in Washington that is not going to contribute to a stable situation,"" Mr. Thompson said.","""未披露名字的公司、不真诚的声明，基本上没有来自北京的可信信息，这些都在华盛顿引起了一定程度的不安，无助于稳定局势，""唐安竹表示。"
"When news of the balloon's foray over the United States first emerged last week, it seemed possible that attention to it would quickly pass. The Biden administration said the vessel posed no threat to Americans. China, for its part, was unusually contrite, issuing a rare acknowledgment of fault and expressing regret.",两周前，气球在美国上空出现的消息首次公开后，人们对气球的关注似乎有可能很快会过去。拜登政府曾表示，气球对美国人不构成威胁。中国也罕见地承认了错误，还表示了遗憾。
"China in recent months has striven for a more conciliatory tone in its diplomacy, compared to the abrasive ""Wolf Warrior"" style often assumed under China's leader, Xi Jinping. Battered by three years of Covid restrictions and an unsteady economy, Beijing seems intent on focusing on domestic issues and minimizing its conflicts on the world stage.","与中国领导人习近平上台后经常采取的粗暴的""战狼""风格相比，中国在最近几个月力求使用更为温和的外交口吻。在三年的新冠""清零""和不景气经济的打击下，中国政府似乎想把注意力集中在国内问题上，尽量减少世界舞台上的冲突。"
But it has become clear this week that the incident is not going to fade so easily.,但上周已变得清楚的是，气球事件不会那么容易地淡出视野。
"On Thursday, the State Department laid out, in the most detail to date, its view that the balloon was part of a global surveillance fleet directed by China's military. American officials have also said that they have shared information on the espionage program with dozens of countries, and are weighing measures against Chinese companies or other bodies that may have been involved.",美国国务院上周四给出了迄今为止最详细的说法，认为该气球是中国军方指挥的全球侦察气球编队的一部分。美国官员还表示，他们已与数十个国家分享了有关中国气球侦察计划的信息，并正在权衡对中国公司或其他可能参与其中的部门采取措施。
"America's domestic political calendar may also have contributed to the continually simmering tensions. Though he did not directly mention the balloon in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Biden promised to ward off Chinese threats to U.S. sovereignty, and declared that few world leaders would envy Mr. Xi. The president repeated those criticisms in a subsequent interview with PBS NewsHour, where he said that the Chinese leader faced ""enormous problems,"" including a weakened economy.","美国国内政治的日程表可能也是两国紧张局势持续升温的原因之一。虽然拜登总统在上周二的国情咨文中没有直接提到气球事件，但他发誓要抵御中国威胁美国主权的行为，并宣称世界上没有几个领导人会羡慕习近平。拜登在发表演讲后接受美国公共广播公司NewsHour采访时重复了这些说法，他说中国领导人需要对付""巨大的问题""，包括经济疲软。"
"China, probably unsurprisingly, has hit back, with state media bashing Mr. Biden's speech. The Global Times, a nationalist Communist Party-run tabloid, said the address, including its singling out of China, ""did not seem like a State of the Union by the president of a major country that considers itself a world leader.""","中国对此奋力反击，大概就不足为奇了。中国官媒抨击了拜登的演讲。中共的民族主义小报《环球时报》称，拜登的演讲(包括他将中国挑出来进行批评的做法)""不像是一个以世界领导者自居的大国总统发表的国情咨文""。"
"At a news conference on Thursday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, called Mr. Biden's comments about Mr. Xi ""highly irresponsible"" and a ""violation of basic diplomatic protocol.""","中国外交部发言人毛宁在上周四的例行记者会上表示，拜登对习近平的评论""极不负责任""，""违反了基本的外交礼节""。"
"Ms. Mao has also increasingly moved away from the initial regret the foreign ministry expressed about the balloon incident in general, repeatedly accusing the United States of exaggeration and hypocrisy.",毛宁也在越来越远地偏离外交部最初对气球事件表示遗憾的说法，多次指责美国夸张、虚伪。
"""I am not aware of any 'fleet of balloons,'"" she said in response to a reporter's question about the United States' allegation of a wide-ranging balloon spying program. ""That narrative is probably part of the information and public opinion warfare the U.S. has waged on China. As to who is the world's number-one country of spying, eavesdropping and surveillance, that is plainly visible to the international community.""","""我没有听说过什么'机群'，""她在回答记者关于美国指控中国的大范围气球侦察计划的问题时说。""这是美方对中国进行信息舆论战的一部分。谁是世界上最大的间谍监听监测国家，国际社会看得很清楚。"""
"China's defense ministry took a similarly hard line when it issued a statement on Thursday explaining its rejection of a proposed phone call from its American counterpart. It called the United States' downing of the balloon an ""irresponsible, serious mistake"" that did not foster conditions for dialogue.","中国国防部上周四发表声明，解释拒绝美国提出的两国防长通话的建议时，采取了类似的强硬立场。中国国防部称美国击落气球是""不负责任的严重错误""，没有为开展对话交流创造条件。"
"On Monday, China's ambassador to France had made perhaps the most aggressive public comments yet, in an interview with a French television program. The ambassador, Lu Shaye, said that it would have been inappropriate for Mr. Blinken to visit China, anyway, given actions leading up to the visit that Mr. Lu described as anti-China. He cited the planned U.S. military expansion in the Philippines and arms sales to Taiwan.","上周一，中国驻法国大使在接受法国电视节目采访时发表了也许是迄今为止最气势汹汹的公开说法。卢沙野大使说，布林肯""所谓的访问本就不合时宜，因为近期美方进行了很多反华活动""，他给的例子包括美国扩大在菲律宾的军事存在和对台军售的计划。"
"Many Chinese political commentators have maintained that the United States is the driver of tensions, and that China is eager for a detente. But even in saying so, some have adopted a hawkish tone.",中国的许多政治评论人士坚持认为，美国是紧张局势始作俑者，中国渴望缓和局势。但一些人在坚持这种说法的同时仍采取了鹰派的口吻。
"""It will be difficult for China-U.S. relations to return to a benign and healthy development track, and the United States should bear the main responsibility for this,"" Shen Yi, a prominent professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in a column. He added that the balloon incident had ""revealed a bit of America's true face.""","上海复旦大学有名的国际关系学教授沈逸在一篇专栏文章中写道，""中美关系将很难回到良性、健康的发展轨道上，美方应对此负主要责任。""他还说，气球事件""显露出美国真实面貌的一角""。"
"Beijing has offered some olive branches. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said China would welcome a visit from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in response to Ms. Yellen's statement earlier this week that she still hoped to go.",中国政府也伸出了一些橄榄枝。上周四，中国商务部发言人表示，中国欢迎美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦来访，这是对耶伦上周早些时候表示仍希望访华的回应。
"The Global Times, despite attacking Mr. Biden's State of the Union address, also published an opinion piece emphasizing the importance of Chinese and American economic interdependence.",尽管《环球时报》抨击了拜登的国情咨文，但也发表了一篇评论文章，强调中美在经济上相互依赖的重要性。
"Richard McGregor, a senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, an Australia-based foreign policy think tank, said that any explicit moves toward escalation would likely come from the United States, given that it had more reasons to do so. He cited the bipartisan political pressure and anxiety about China's rise. ""It makes the U.S. actions a little more unpredictable than China's,"" he said.","澳大利亚外交政策智库洛伊研究所的东亚高级研究员马利德(Richard McGregor)表示，任何明确的升级做法很可能都来自美国，因为美国有更多的理由这样做。他列举了两党政治的压力，以及对中国崛起的焦虑。""这让美国的做法与中国的相比更难预测，""他说。"
"China, he added, did not yet seem to be abandoning its hopes for a softer diplomatic tack, despite the unexpected challenges: ""They've committed to a new direction for the moment.""","他还说，尽管出现了意想不到的挑战，但中国似乎仍未放弃采取更温和的外交策略的希望:""他们目前已承诺走入新方向。"""
"But as the drumbeat of information about the balloon from the United States continues, China could face added pressure to respond more harshly.",但随着美国继续不停地对气球事件发声，中国可能面临需要做出更严厉回应的更大压力。
"The onus was likely on China to forestall more tensions, Douglas H. Paal, a former American diplomat and scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said at a webinar on Friday.",阻止更多紧张局势的责任可能在中国，美国前外交官包道格(Douglas H. Paal)上周五在一个网络研讨会上表示，他现在是卡内基国际和平基金会的学者。
"""You have to light a backfire against this coming series of revelations early on,"" he said at the event hosted by the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing think tank. ""It would be smart for both sides, especially for the Chinese side, to start being more responsive before events start to accumulate again.""","""中国需要在接连不断的爆料出来之前尽早做好准备，""包道格在北京智库中国与全球化中心主办的活动上说。""对双方来说，尤其是对中方来说，在事件开始再次累积之前，一开始就做出更积极的反应是明智做法。"""
"WASHINGTON The U.S. government is combing over a variety of intelligence debris, reconnaissance plane photos and old observations to learn what the Chinese spy balloon was after as it made its way across the United States in early February, before being shot down by a Sidewinder missile fired by a stealth fighter jet last weekend.",华盛顿——美国政府正在梳理残骸、侦察机照片和以往观察结果等各种情报，探究中国间谍气球在2月初飞越美国上空的目的何在。该气球上周末已被一架隐形战斗机发射的响尾蛇飞弹击落。
"The Chinese spy balloon was equipped with an antenna meant to pinpoint the locations of communications devices and was capable of intercepting calls made on those devices, according to declassified intelligence released by the State Department on Thursday.",根据国务院周四公布的解密情报，这个中国间谍气球上装有天线，用于精确定位通信设备，还能拦截这些设备上发出的通话。
"The balloon, which traversed America for several days, transfixed the public and focused attention both in Washington and across the country on the intensifying rivalry between China and the United States.",这个气球在美国上空飞行数日，震惊了公众，令华盛顿和全国集中关注中美之间愈发激烈的斗争。
"In the wake of the discovery of the balloon, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken canceled a planned trip to Beijing. China, perhaps in retaliation, rebuffed attempts by Lloyd J. Austin III, the defense secretary, to call his Chinese counterpart to discuss the spy balloon, further raising the temperature of an already tense relationship between the world's two superpowers.",气球被发现后，国务卿布林肯取消了原定的北京之行。或许是出于报复，中国拒绝了国防部长劳埃德·奥斯汀三世试图与中方同级官员讨论间谍气球的通话请求，这进一步加剧了两个全球超级大国之间本已紧张的关系。
Here is what we know about the balloon.,以下是我们对气球事件的了解。
What was the spy balloon collecting?,这个间谍气球在收集什么?
This is the big question. Officials do not yet know what information the balloon was supposed to be stealing as it made its way across the country.,这正是问题所在。官员们尚不清楚气球在飞越美国的途中可能窃取什么信息。
The balloon had a signals intelligence array fancy spy speak for an antenna that can locate communications devices and listen into them. But officials do not yet know if that array was meant to gather calls made on military radios or from ordinary mobile phones or something else altogether.,气球上有一个信号情报阵列——这一难以理解的间谍术语指的是可以定位并监听通信设备的天线。但官员尚不清楚该阵列是用来收集军用无线电还是普通手机上的通话，或是完全与此无关。
How many spy balloons have there been?,有多少这样的间谍气球?
"Balloons are hard to pick up on radar. Many of the first Chinese spy balloons that were observed near U.S. military exercises or bases were not identified as surveillance tools. Instead, they were classified as unidentified aerial phenomena, modern-day Pentagon jargon for U.F.O.s.",气球很难被雷达发现。在美国军事演习或军事基地附近观察到的首批中国间谍气球中，许多并未被判定为监视工具。相反，它们被归类为不明空中现象，即如今五角大楼对不明飞行物的说法。
"Over the past 18 months, the United States began learning more about the Chinese spy balloon program. As officials reviewed some previous cases of unidentified aerial phenomena, they determined that they were spy balloons. A review of the old data showed that at least three spy balloons entered U.S. airspace during the Trump administration. There was at least one additional visit during the Biden administration.",在过去18个月，美国对中国间谍气球计划开始有了更多了解。官员回顾了此前一些不明空中现象的案例，确定它们是间谍气球。审阅旧数据可以发现，至少有三个间谍气球在特朗普任内进入美国领空。拜登任内至少还出现过一次。
But all of those previous incidents were relatively short not the dayslong transit of this month's spy balloon.,但以往这些情况都相对短暂，不像本月间谍气球事件那样持续数日之久。
Was this part of a wider Chinese surveillance program?,这是否与更广泛的中国监视计划相关?
"China has developed a spy balloon program as a complement to its fleet of reconnaissance satellites, American officials said, with a mission to collect information across the world.",美国官员表示，中国已经开展间谍气球计划，作为其侦察卫星群的补充，其任务是在全球各地收集信息。
"Because the capabilities of the spy balloons are not yet perfectly understood, it is not certain if they gather different information than China's satellites. Nevertheless, officials said, at the very least the balloons can linger longer over a site than a satellite. And while reconnaissance satellites are often focused on imagery, the balloons appear to be mostly about collecting communications.",由于尚未完全了解这些间谍气球的能力，因此无法确定它们收集到的信息是否比中国卫星更多。尽管如此，官员称气球在一个地点的停留时间至少比卫星更久。侦察卫星通常专注于影像，而气球似乎主要是用来收集通信。
"Some officials say the spy balloon program has been focused in the Pacific region, collecting information on American bases and allied military operations.",一些官员表示，中国间谍气球计划将重点放在太平洋地区，收集了有关美军基地和盟国军事行动的信息。
"And of course, the Chinese do not just use balloons to conduct surveillance at military bases. Some classified reports suggest they are also using advanced technologies to collect information about the U.S. military.",当然，中国监视军事基地的手段不只有气球。一些机密报告指出，中国还在使用先进技术收集美国军方的信息。
Is this a big deal or not?,这严重吗?
Yes.,是的。
"To be clear, the balloon saga is not comparable to an earthquake in Turkey that killed more than 20,000. Nor is it comparable to the war in Ukraine that is set to enter into a second year.",先明确一点，气球事件无法与土耳其发生的造成2万多人死亡的地震，或即将进入第二年的乌克兰战争相提并论。
"That said, the spy balloon incident will complicate the relationship between the two most powerful countries on Earth.",即使如此，间谍气球事件仍将使这两个地球上最强大的国家之间的关系变得复杂。
Some policymakers and lawmakers in Washington have been arguing for years that the U.S. public has not taken the challenge of China seriously enough prioritizing the country's cheap mobile phones and entertaining videos on its platform TikTok over concerns about an authoritarian state that bolsters its power through the intrusive surveillance of its people.,多年来，华盛顿的一些政策制定者和立法者一直在争论，美国公众没有足够认真地对待中国的挑战——他们更关注中国的廉价手机和其平台TikTok上的娱乐视频，而不是担心一个通过对其人民进行侵扰性监控来巩固权力的威权国家。
"But the balloon ordeal was a big enough deal for the State Department to cancel Mr. Blinken's planned trip the first by a Biden cabinet secretary to Beijing without rescheduling it. When he canceled the trip, Mr. Blinken said the entry of the balloon was a ""clear violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law.""","但气球事件的严重性足以让国务院取消布林肯计划中的访问——这是拜登政府国务卿首次访华——而且没有做出重新安排。当他取消这次旅行时，布林肯说气球的进入是""对美国主权和国际法的明显侵犯""。"
What is the plan for recovering debris?,计划如何回收残片?
"Navy divers have been working to gather debris of the balloon since Sunday for America's own intelligence-gathering purposes, Pentagon and F.B.I. officials said. The recovery effort is expected to take days.",五角大楼和FBI官员说，自周日以来，海军潜水员一直在努力收集气球残片，用于美国自己的情报收集目的。恢复工作预计需要几天时间。
"The balloon itself was quickly retrieved, as well as some wiring that was floating on the ocean surface. But most of the electronics were in the balloon payload, carried underneath. The remains of that are scattered across the ocean floor, albeit in the relatively shallow waters off the South Carolina coast.",气球本体以及漂浮在海面上的一些电缆很快被回收。大部分电子设备都在气球有效载荷中，但放置在气球下方。这些残片散落在海底，但位于南卡罗来纳州海岸外相对较浅的水域。
"The dive teams are handing over the recovered material to the F.B.I., which will take it to its lab in Quantico, Va. What state it will be in, and how much can be learned from it, remains an open question.",潜水队正在将回收的材料移交给FBI，FBI将把它带到弗吉尼亚州匡蒂科的实验室。材料的状态以及人们可以从中获得到多少信息仍然是悬而未决的问题。
What happens next?,接下来会发生什么?
"The Biden administration has continued to declassify and share information it has learned about the spy balloon, bringing in allied and partner nations for briefings about China's surveillance programs.",拜登政府将继续对从间谍气球获悉的信息进行解密和分享，邀请盟国和合作伙伴国家听取有关中国侦察计划的简报。
The diplomatic push is a sign that the Biden administration intends to use the incident to rally allies and convince them that China's global ambitions could involve infringements of their sovereignty.,外交推动表明，拜登政府打算利用这一事件来团结盟友，让他们相信中国的全球野心可能会侵犯它们的主权。
"Beijing was angry over the United States' decision to shoot down the balloon, which the Chinese Foreign Ministry described as ""excessive."" China has maintained that the balloon was a civilian device for meteorological purposes.","北京对美国击落气球的决定感到愤怒，中国外交部称其""过度""。中国坚称，该气球是用于气象目的的民用装置。"
"Points of friction between Beijing and the United States are becoming increasingly common. China fired a barrage of missiles in the wake of last year's visit to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Representative Kevin McCarthy said before succeeding her this year that he would also like to visit the self-governing island, which China considers its territory.",北京和美国之间的摩擦点越来越普遍。众议院议长南希·佩洛西去年访台后，中国发射了一连串导弹。众议员凯文·麦卡锡在今年接替她之前表示，自己也想访问该自治岛屿。中国声称对台湾拥有主权。
"TAIPEI, Taiwan Long before an unmanned Chinese airship floating over the United States grabbed the world's attention, Taiwan may have glimpsed Beijing's ambitions to turn balloons seemingly so old-fashioned and ponderous into elusive tools of 21st-century military power.",台湾台北——早在一艘中国无人飞艇飘过美国上空，吸引全世界的注意力之前，台湾对北京所追求的目标可能就已经有所体验，那就是将看起来如此老式、笨重的气球，变成21世纪军事大国神出鬼没的工具。
"Residents in Taipei and elsewhere on the island have spotted and photographed mysterious pale orbs high in the sky at least several times in the previous two years. But few people here, even officials, gave them much thought then. Now, Taiwanese officials are grappling with whether any of the balloons were part of China's growing fleet of airborne surveillance craft, deployed to gather information from the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.",在过去两年里，台北和台湾其他地方的民众已至少数次看到并拍下飘在高空的白色神秘球体。但在当时，很少有人对它们想太多，就连官员也是如此。现在，台湾官员们正在设法搞清楚，那些气球是否属于中国不断壮大的空中侦察飞行器队伍的一部分，由中国派来对其宣称拥有主权的自治岛屿台湾收集信息。
"The incursions have come into focus since the United States identified and shot down the Chinese balloon that had spent days traversing the country. Beijing has protested the balloon's downing, asserting that it was a civilian ship doing scientific research. But American officials say that the balloon was part of a global surveillance effort targeting the military capabilities of various countries.",自从美国发现并击落了在其领空飘行数日的中国气球后，这些曾在台湾上空出现的东西成了人们关注的焦点。中国政府对击落气球提出了抗议，称它是一艘进行科学研究的民用飞艇。但美国官员说，该气球是中国全球监视努力的一部分，目的是搜集有关各国军事能力的情报。
"China's surveillance airships are likely operated by the Strategic Support Force, experts say, a relatively new and often secretive arm of the Chinese military that carries out electronic surveillance and cyber operations. The force emerged from the Chinese leader Xi Jinping's drive to modernize the People's Liberation Army, including expanding its intelligence capabilities, spanning from satellites in space to vessels deep undersea, said Su Tzu-yun, an analyst at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei.",专家说，中国的侦察飞艇很可能由战略支援部队操作，这是一支成立时间相对较短、通常进行秘密行动的部队，负责执行电子侦察和网上任务。台北国防安全研究院的分析师苏紫云说，这支部队起源于中国领导人习近平推动人民解放军现代化的努力，包括增强使用从太空卫星到深海船只等工具搜集情报的能力。
"""The balloons should be understood as one part of its electronic spying system,"" he said in an interview. Even data that the balloons can gather about humidity and air currents may be militarily useful, he said. If China ever launches missiles, ""this atmospheric information could improve their accuracy.""","""气球应该是被理解为它的electronic spying system(电子情报搜集系统)一部分，""苏紫云在接受采访时说。他还表示，就连气球能收集到的有关湿度和气流的数据，也可能在军事上有用。如果中国发射导弹，""这些大气的资料可以提高它的准确度。"""
"A review of Chinese military studies, newspaper articles and patent filings illuminates the range of Beijing's interests and ambitions with balloons.",通过查阅中国军方发表的研究论文、报纸上刊登的文章以及申请的专利，可以了解到中国政府对使用气球的兴趣和所追求目标的范围之广。
"Chinese military scientists have been studying new materials and techniques to make balloons more durable, more steerable and harder to detect and track. People's Liberation Army researchers have also been testing balloons as potential aerial platforms from which to fire weapons.",中国军事科学家们一直在研究让气球更耐用、更易操纵，同时更难被发现、更难追踪的新材料和新技术。中国人民解放军的研究人员也一直在测试将气球作为空中武器发射平台的潜力。
"Even in this hitherto obscure corner of military innovation, China sees big stakes. Its military researchers warn that rival governments, above all the United States, could beat them at their own game. They especially worry about dominance in ""near space,"" the inhospitable layer of the atmosphere between 12 and 62 miles above earth.",即使在这个以前鲜为人知的军事创新角落，中国也看到了巨大的利害关系。中国军事研究人员警告，敌对政府——尤其是美国，可能会在这个领域有打败中国的强项。他们尤其担心占据所谓临近空间的主导地位问题，即距地面20公里到100公里、人类尚未开发的大气层。
"""Near space has become a new battleground in modern warfare,"" an article in the Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of China's military, said in 2018. It celebrated China's feat in the previous year of sending a balloon, carrying a small live turtle, over 12 miles up. Last year, China experimented with using rockets to propel balloons up to 25 miles above the earth.","""临近空间也已经成为现代战争的一个新战场，""中国军队的官方报纸《解放军报》2018年发表的一篇文章写道。该文祝贺中国在2017年成功试飞了一个气球，将一只活体小乌龟带入了临近空间。去年，中国进行了基于高空气球的探空火箭发射试验，用气球将火箭带到20公里到40公里的高空。"
"The Chinese military, like other militaries, wants to ""try all the options,"" said Bates Gill, the author of a recent study, Daring to Struggle: China's Global Ambitions Under Xi Jinping.","中国军队与其他国家的军队一样，想""尝试所有的选择""，季北慈(Bates Gill)说，他最近发表了一份题为《敢于战斗:中国在习近平领导下的全球野心》的研究报告。"
"""My sense is the People's Liberation Army is pretty unrestrained these days,"" said Mr. Gill, the executive director of the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. ""Not in the 'Wild West,' corrupt sense of the past, but in the sense of how it experiments and pushes the envelope.""","""我的感觉是，这些日子里，中国人民解放军相当无节制，""在亚洲协会政策研究所担任中国分析中心执行主任的季北慈说。""不是'西大荒'过去那种存在问题的无节制，而是进行试验和挑战极限意义上的无节制。"""
"Such boldness may explain the recent balloon flights in the United States and Taiwan, which did not go entirely unnoticed. In September 2021, residents of Taipei, the capital of the island, made anxious calls to weather officials to ask about a pale, tiny dot they were seeing high above them.",这种大胆妄为也许可以解释最近从美国和台湾上空飞过的气球，它们并不是完全没有引起注意。2021年9月，台湾台北的居民们忧心忡忡地给气象官员打电话，询问在高空中出现的一个浅色小点是什么东西。
"Cheng Ming-dean, the head of Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau, checked a close-up photograph of it and told people to relax: It was just a balloon. The large balloons were seen twice in late 2021 as well as in March of last year. Four clusters of smaller balloons were also spotted early last year.",台湾中央气象局局长郑明典查看了一张小白点的特写照片后让人们放心:它只是个气球。大气球后来在2021年底又出现过两次，并且在去年3月出现过。去年年初还看到过四组较小的气球。
"""Back then, I don't think Taiwan was paying particular attention to this kind of thing,"" Mr. Cheng said in an interview.","""在当时的话，我觉得我们台湾并没有特别在意这种，""郑明典在接受采访时说。"
"Now, as some smaller states particularly those the United States describes as allies and partners confront this new potential threat of surveillance, their options may be limited.",现在，一些较小的国家——尤其是那些被美国称为盟友和伙伴的国家——面临这种新的潜在监视威胁，但它们的选择可能有限。
"Shooting down balloons is likely to be difficult and expensive for many air forces, saidChang Yan-ting, a retired deputy commander of Taiwan's Air Force. Over 30 years ago, he was a jet pilot sent up to inspect threeballoons that were believed to be Chinese. In the end, he decided that they posed no threat, and would have been too hard to bring down, anyway.",击落气球对许多国家的空军来说可能既困难又代价太高，已经退役的台湾空军副司令员张延廷说。他30多年前担任喷气机飞行员时，曾接受飞行任务，查看三个疑似来自中国的气球。他最后的决定是气球不构成威胁，而且也很难将它们打下来。
"""It's very difficult; these balloons don't give a radar reflection,"" he said in an interview. ""Look at the United States: It went to enormous efforts to send F-22s, its best fighter jet, and used its most advanced missiles to strike it did you see? A bit like using a cannon to shoot a small bird.""","""很难，气球没有雷达的反射，""他在接受采访时说。""你看这是美国，你看它大费周章派F22——最好的战机，用最先进、最新的飞弹去打你，看到没有?有点大炮打小鸟。"""
"To be clear, the core of China's digital intelligence collection system remains an armada of more than 260 satellites dedicated to intelligence and surveillance. The balloons, however, may offer some advantages over satellites because they can hover over areas and may produce clearer images, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.",需要明确的是，中国数字情报收集系统的核心仍然由专门用于情报和监视的260多颗卫星组成。但据美国官员说，这些气球可能提供一些卫星没有的优势，因为气球能停留在某个区域的上空，拍下更清晰的图像。由于讨论的是敏感问题，这些官员要求不具名。
"The Chinese military is aware of such advantages. In modern battlefields, too, ""maintaining constant aerial surveillance has become an urgent task,"" a Chinese Liberation Army Daily report said in 2021. With satellites and planes alone, the report said, ""it is hard to achieve full-time, full-scope, fixed-point early warning and surveillance from the air.""","中国军方很清楚这些优势所在。在当代战场上，""保持持续的空中监视成为一项紧迫任务，""《解放军报》2021年的一篇报道这样写道。该文还说，仅靠卫星和飞机，""难以实现全时段全范围内的空中定点预警监视。"""
"If the Chinese Strategic Support Force was responsible for the recent balloon mission over the United States, the force's relative newness and fragmented background may help to explain how the operation went ahead with seemingly little calculation of the trouble it could create, said Mr. Gill, who has studied the force. It was formed as part of a sweeping military reorganization that Mr. Xi launched in 2015, absorbing parts of the air force, navy and army.",如果中国的战略支援部队对最近在美国上空的气球飞行负有责任的话，这只部队存在的时间相对较短，而且是由以前独立的部份组合起来的这点，也许有助于解释执行任务前似乎没有考虑过它可能造成的麻烦，曾对这支部队进行过研究的季北慈说。解放军战略支援部队是习近平2015年对军队进行大规模重组后建立的，吸收了来自空军、海军和陆军的部分。
"Poor internal communication between the Chinese military and civilian government, and even inside the People's Liberation Army and Strategic Support Force itself, may have contributed to the problem, Mr. Gill said.",季北慈说，中国军队与政府文职部门之间的内部沟通不畅，甚至中国人民解放军内部与战略支援部队的沟通也不畅，这也许是导致气球事件发生的原因。
"""It's a really good example of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing in China,"" he said.","""这是中国政府内部右手不知道左手在做什么的一个典型例子，""他说。"
The recent attention on China's balloon program may discourage the Chinese military from deploying new ones for a while. But the research will likely forge ahead.,最近对中国气球项目的关注可能会让中国军方在一段时间内暂停部署新气球。但相关研究很可能继续向前推进。
"Military scientists, especially at China's National University of Defense Technology, have worked on new materials, designs and navigation tools to make balloons more nimble and long-lasting. They have filed patents for innovations such as a ""three-dimensional flight path tracking method for an unmanned airship,"" and articles in the Chinese military's newspapers indicate it pays attention to balloon developments in the United States, France, Israel and other countries.","军事科学家，尤其是中国国防科技大学的那些科学家，一直在研究让气球更灵活、更持久的新材料、新设计和导航工具。 他们已为有关创新申请了专利，比如""基于可行域约束的无人飞行器三维航迹自适应跟踪方法""。中国军方报纸上的文章显示，军方一直在关注美国、法国、以色列等国家的气球研发。"
"One lecturer from the National University of Defense Technology, wrote last year in the Liberation Army Daily that China could try to develop smart high-altitude balloons that are able to escape the more turbulent lower atmosphere and catch the steadier wind currents of the upper atmosphere, enabling them to surf long distances helped by small motors.",国防科技大学的一名讲师去年在《解放军报》上写道，中国可以尝试研发能避开大气湍流层、进入气流更稳定的高层大气的智能平流层浮空器，让它们在小型发动机的帮助下实现长时间飞行或驻留。
"""With their many advantages,"" another article in the same newspaper said last year, ""balloons seem to be ushering in their springtime of development.""","《解放军报》去年发表的另一文章说，""众多优长""让""气球似乎正迎来发展的春天""。"
"Chinese researchers have also speculated about using high-altitude balloons to carry and launch missiles from near space, where they would be harder to detect, to earth.",中国的研究人员还在探讨用临近空间的高空气球携带和向地面发射导弹的问题。临近空间的导弹更难被发现。
"In 2018, China's state broadcaster said that researchers had tested a balloon platform that they said could be used to launch hypersonic weapons which can fly at several times the speed of sound from midair. But Chinese reports about the country's military advances are prone to exaggeration. That report noted that the test used scale models, and it is debatable whether China's other military balloon capabilities always live up to the swaggering claims.",2018年，中国国家广播电台报道说，研究人员做了一个气球平台实验，他们说该平台可把高超声速武器带上天，高超声速指的是飞行速度可达音速的几倍。但中国在报道本国军事进展时往往有夸大。这篇报道指出，实验使用的是缩比模型。中国其他军用气球的能力是否真像报道的那样厉害，是值得商榷的。
"Technical shortcomings may help explain the untimely appearance of the Chinese balloon over the United States just before the Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, was to fly to Beijing. He canceled that trip.",技术短点也许有助于解释中国气球为什么在美国国务卿布林肯即将飞往北京之前，不合时宜地在美国上空出现。布林肯已取消了行程。
"""It may have been bad timing,"" Mr. Su, the Taiwanese military researcher, said. ""It's become relatively easy to control the direction of balloons, but controlling their speed is a different matter.""","""这可能是个糟糕的时间选择，""台湾的军事研究员苏紫云说。""虽然控制气球的飞行方向已变得相对容易，但控制它们的速度是另一回事。"""
"The first sows arrived in late September at the hulking, 26-story high-rise towering above a rural village in central China. The female pigs were whisked away dozens at a time in industrial elevators to the higher floors where the hogs would reside from insemination to maturity.",在中国中部一个村子，耸立着一幢26层的大型养猪场。去年9月下旬，首批母猪被运到了这里。母猪被分成几百头一拨，用大型货梯运上高楼，从受精到成熟，这些猪将一直住在那里。
"This is pig farming in China, where agricultural land is scarce, food production is lagging and pork supply is a strategic imperative.",这就是中国的养猪业，这里耕地稀少、粮食生产不足、猪肉供应是战略要务。
"Inside the hulking edifice, which resembles the monolithic housing blocks seen across China and stands as tall as the London tower that houses Big Ben, the pigs are monitored on high-definition cameras by uniformed technicians in a NASA-like command center. Each floor operates like a self-contained farm for the different stages of a young pig's life: an area for pregnant pigs, a room for farrowing piglets, spots for nursing and space for fattening the young hogs.",这栋看起来类似中国各地住宅小区里常见的那种大型住宅楼的庞大建筑与伦敦的大本钟一样高，身穿工作服的技术人员在类似于NASA指挥中心的监控室里通过高清摄像机看管这些猪。每层都像是独立的农场，按小猪生命的不同阶段分成区:怀孕母猪区、产仔区、哺乳区，还有将小猪养肥的地方。
"Feed is carried on a conveyor belt to the top floor, where it's collected in giant tanks that deliver more than one million pounds of food a day to the floors below through high-tech feeding troughs that automatically dispense the meal to the hogs based on their stage of life, weight and health.",饲料通过传送带输送到大楼顶层的巨型贮罐，这些罐子每天将近50万公斤的饲料投放到下面楼层的高科技喂食槽，根据猪生长阶段、体重和健康的需求，将饲料自动分配给猪。
"The building, located on the outskirts of Ezhou, a city on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, is being hailed as the world's biggest free-standing pig farm with a second identical hog high-rise opening soon. The first farm started operating in October, and once both buildings reach full capacity later this year, it is expected to raise 1.2 million pigs annually.",这栋养猪大楼位于长江南岸城市鄂州的郊区，被称为世界单体面积最大的楼房养猪场，还有一栋同样高的养猪大楼即将投产。第一栋高层养猪场已于去年10月投产，两栋大楼在今年晚些时候全面投入使用后，预计每年可饲养生猪120万头。
"China has had a long love affair with pigs. For decades, many rural Chinese households raised backyard pigs, considered valuable livestock as not only a source of meat but also manure. Pigs also hold cultural significance as a symbol of prosperity because, historically, pork was served only on special occasions.",中国对猪的喜爱历史悠久。几十年来，许多中国农村家庭喜欢在后院养猪，养猪有很多好处，不仅为人提供肉食，也为耕地提供肥料。猪还具有象征繁荣的文化意义，因为历史上，农民只是在特别值得庆祝的时候才吃猪肉。
"Today, no country eats more pork than China, which consumes half of the world's pig meat. Pork prices are closely watched as a measure of inflation and carefully managed through the country's strategic pork reserve a government meat stockpile that can stabilize prices when supplies run low.",如今，世界上没有哪个国家比中国吃更多的猪肉，中国的猪肉消费占世界总量的一半。政府密切关注猪肉价格，将其作为通货膨胀的一个指标，并通过国家的战略猪肉储备(猪肉供应不足时政府用来稳定价格)进行谨慎管理。
"But pork prices are higher than in other major nations where pig farming went industrial a long time ago. In the last few years, dozens of other mammoth industrialized pig farms have sprung up across China as part of Beijing's drive to close that gap.",但中国的猪肉价格比养猪业早已工业化的其他主要国家的高。在过去的几年里，作为政府缩小猪肉价格差距努力的一部分，几十个巨型工业化养猪场已在中国各地如雨后春笋般涌现。
"Built by Hubei Zhongxin Kaiwei Modern Animal Husbandry, a cement manufacturer turned pig breeder, the Ezhou farm stands like a monument to China's ambition to modernize pork production.",鄂州的养猪场是湖北中新开维现代牧业有限公司建设的，该公司曾是一家水泥生产商，后来转入养猪业。这栋大楼就像是中国实现猪肉生产现代化雄心壮志的纪念碑。
"""China's current pig breeding is still decades behind the most advanced nations,"" said Zhuge Wenda, the company's president. ""This provides us with room for improvement to catch up.""","""我们目前中国的生猪行业，整个的养殖水平与世界先进水平比还有几十年的差距，""中新开维总裁诸葛文达说。""这个差距就是我们通过规模化工业化的养殖可以提升的空间。"""
"The farm is next to the company's cement factory, in a region of the country known as the ""Land of Fish and Rice"" for its importance to Chinese cuisine with its fertile farmlands and surrounding bodies of water.","养猪大楼离公司的水泥厂不远。鄂州地处""鱼米之乡""，这里肥沃的农田和附近的水域对中国的菜篮子有重要意义。"
"A pig farm in name, the operation is actually more like a Foxconn factory for pigs with the precision required of an iPhone production line. Even pig feces is measured, collected and repurposed. Roughly one-quarter of the feed will come out as dry excrement that can be repurposed as methane to generate electricity.",虽然名义上叫养猪场，但实际上更像是为养猪而建的富士康工厂，操作的精准度堪比iPhone生产线。就连猪的粪便也被称重、收集、重新利用。大约四分之一的饲料会变成粪便，可重新利用来生产沼气，用于发电。
"Six decades after a famine killed tens of millions of its people, China still trails most of the developed world when it comes to efficient food production. China is the biggest importer of agricultural goods, including more than half of the world's soybeans, mostly for animal feed. It has about 10 percent of the planet's arable land for around 20 percent of the global population. Its crops cost more to produce and its farmlands yield less corn, wheat and soybean per acre than other major economies.",中国曾在60年前发生过导致几千万人死亡的大饥荒，目前在高效粮食生产上仍落后于大多数发达国家。中国是世界上最大的农产品进口国，包括购买全球一半以上的大豆，主要用于动物饲料。中国人口约占全球的20%，但可耕地只占全球的10%。中国农作物的生产成本更高，玉米、小麦和大豆的每亩产量比其他主要经济体低。
"The shortcomings became more pronounced in the last few years when trade disputes with the U.S., pandemic-related supply disruptions and the war in Ukraine underscored China's potential food security risk. In a December policy address, Xi Jinping, China's leader, called agricultural self-reliance a priority.",这些问题已在过去几年变得更加突出，与美国的贸易争端、与新冠病毒大流行有关的供应中断，以及乌克兰战争都突显出中国潜在的粮食安全风险。中国领导人习近平在去年12月的农村工作会议上发表讲话时说，农业自力更生是头等大事。
"""A country must strengthen its agriculture before making itself a great power, and only a robust agriculture can make the country strong,"" Mr. Xi said. In the past, he has warned that China would ""fall under others' control if we don't hold our rice bowl steady.""","""强国必先强农，农强方能国强，""习近平说。他以前曾警告说，中国""端不稳自己的饭碗，就会受制于人""。"
"And no protein is more important for the Chinese rice bowl than pork. The State Council, China's cabinet, issued a decree in 2019 stating that all government departments needed to support the pork industry, including financial aid for more large-scale pig farms. In the same year, Beijing also said that it would approve multistory farming, which allowed pig farming to go vertical to raise more hogs on relatively smaller parcels of land.",对于中国人的饭碗来说，没有比猪肉更重要的蛋白质了。中国国务院曾在2019年发布指导意见，要求所有政府部门支持猪肉生产，包括为更多的大型养猪场提供财政补助。同年，政府还表示将允许高层养殖，让在相对少的土地上饲养更多生猪的高层养猪场成为可能。
"""This is a milestone and not only for China, because I think multistory farms will have an impact on the world,"" said Yu Ping, executive director of Yu's Design Institute, a company that designs pig farms.","""这个毫无疑问的，我非常坚信它是个里程碑的意义，不仅是对中国，我想对世界将来肯定都会有影响。""设计鄂州高层养猪场的余氏设计院执行董事余平说。"
"As China has modernized with hundreds of millions of people moving from the countryside to urban centers, small backyard farms have disappeared. The total number of pig farms in China producing fewer than 500 hogs a year has plunged 75 percent since 2007, to around 21 million in 2020, according to an industry report.",在中国实现现代化的过程中，好几亿人已从农村搬到了城市，小型的院落饲养已经消失。一份行业报告显示，生猪每年出栏量不到500头的中国养猪场总数已自2007年以来下降了75%，2020年时只剩下2100万个。
"The shift toward mega-farms accelerated in 2018 when African swine fever ravaged China's pork industry and wiped out, by some estimates, 40 percent of its pig population.",向大型养殖场转型的速度已在2018年加快，那年的非洲猪瘟给中国猪肉产业造成了严重损害，据某些估计，生猪存栏减少了40%。
"Brett Stuart, founder of Global AgriTrends, a market research firm, said hog towers and other giant pig farms exacerbate the biggest risk facing China's pork industry: disease. Raising so many pigs together in a single facility makes it harder to prevent contamination. He said large U.S. pork producers spread out their farms to reduce biosecurity risk.",市场研究公司Global AgriTrends的创始人布雷特·斯图尔特说，高层养猪场和其他大型养猪场加剧了中国猪肉行业面临的最大风险:疾病。在单体设施中同时饲养这么多头猪让防止污染变得更加困难。他说，美国的大型猪肉生产商将它们的养殖场分散到多个地方，以降低生物安全风险。
"""U.S. hog farmers look at the pictures of those farms in China, and they just scratch their heads and say, 'We would never dare do that,'"" said Mr. Stuart. ""It's just too risky.""","""美国养猪户看到中国这些养猪场的照片时表示不可思议，他们说，'我们从来不敢这样做，'""斯图尔特说。""风险太大了。"""
"But when pork prices tripled in a year, coupled with Beijing's support of large-scale pig farms, the rewards appeared to outweigh the risk. A building boom ensued, and a market constrained by supply became overwhelmed with available pigs. Pork prices are down roughly 60 percent from 2019 highs. China's pork industry is marked by Bitcoin-like volatility, riding boom-or-bust cycles that spin off huge profits or losses depending on the wild price swings.",但考虑到猪肉价格在一年内涨了两倍，再加上政府对大型养猪场的补贴，这样做的回报似乎大于风险。接下来是建大型养猪场的热潮，曾经供不应求的市场变得猪肉过剩。猪肉价格已比 2019年最高的时候降了约60%。中国猪肉行业的波动性堪比比特币，价格的剧烈波动导致繁荣或萧条的周期，有的养殖场获得巨利，有的亏损。
"Last month, Jiangxi Zhengbang Technology, a giant hog producer that has expanded rapidly in the last few years, said it was warned that it may be delisted from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange over concerns that the company is insolvent.",上个月，曾在过去几年迅速扩张的大型生猪生产商江西正邦科技警告，由于对公司资不抵债的担忧，深圳证券交易所可会对公司股票实施退市。
"""The hope from the government is that consolidation will make prices more predictable and less volatile over time,"" said Pan Chenjun, executive director at RaboResearch's food and agriculture division. ""That's the ultimate goal.""","""政府的希望是，整合行业将让价格变得更可预测，价格随时间的波动性更小，""RaboResearch的食品和农业部门执行董事潘晨军(音)说。""这是最终目标。"""
"In rural villages, where backyard farms once dotted the countryside, mega-farms are sprouting up.Three years ago, as property and infrastructure sectors started to slump, Hubei Zhongxin Kaiwei decided to use a neighboring plot of land and apply its construction expertise to branch out into a business with better growth prospects. It invested $600 million to build the high-rise pig farms with an additional $900 million earmarked for a nearby meat processing plant.",大型养猪场正在曾经遍布着小型家庭养猪场的农村大量出现。三年前，随着房地产和基础设施行业进入低迷，湖北中新开维决定在附近一块土地上建养猪场，将公司在建筑行业的知识拓展到一个有更好增长前景的行业中去。它投资40亿元，建设两栋高层养猪场，并另行投资60亿元在附近建肉类加工厂。
"Its background in cement is useful in pig farming, the company said. Using its existing employees, it built a land-saving high-rise with reinforced concrete. It is using excess heat from the cement factory to provide hot baths and warm drinking water to the pigs. This, according to Hubei Zhongxin Kaiwei, will help the pigs grow faster with less feed.",中新开维表示，公司的水泥生产背景对养猪有用。为了节省土地，公司利用现有员工，盖了用钢筋混凝土建的高层养猪场，还利用水泥厂的余热为猪提供洗澡用的热水和饮用的温水。据中新开维称，这将有助于猪在不增加饲料的情况下更快地生长。
Small backyard pig farmers are finding it hard to keep pace with that type of scale.,小型后院养猪户发现很难与这种规模的养殖竞争。
"Qiao Yuping, 66, raises about 20 to 30 pigs a year with her husband in Liaoning Province in northeastern China. When pork prices fell last year, she said they didn't make any money. She said it's hard to ignore the impact of mega-farms that drive up feed and vaccine prices for the animals.",中国东北辽宁省的乔玉萍(音)现年66岁，她和丈夫每年养大约20到30头猪。她说，去年猪肉价格下跌后，他们没赚到钱。她说，很难避免大型养猪场推高饲料和猪疫苗价格给他们带来的影响。
"""Everything has gone up in price,"" Ms. Qiao said. ""How can we not be affected?""","""所有的东西都涨价，""乔女士说。""那咋不影响呢?"""
"On Chinese social media, jokes about the suspected spy balloon have been making the rounds. People quipped that the vessel was a misunderstood attempt at wishing Americans a happy Lantern Festival, the Chinese holiday this past Sunday. Others compared it to a glutinous rice ball, a traditional food eaten during the celebrations.",在中国的社交媒体上，关于疑似间谍气球的笑话广为流传。人们开玩笑说，美国人误解了这艘试图祝他们元宵节快乐的飞艇，还有人将气球比作元宵节吃的传统食物汤圆。
"The wisecracking was, in part, what happens on social media anywhere in the world: current events transformed to memes to attract likes and follows. But it also dovetailed with signs of a broader government strategy to downplay an incident that has potentially embarrassed China and threatened to further derail U.S.-China relations.",在某种程度上，这些俏皮话会出现在世界任何地方的社交媒体上:人们为了吸引点赞和关注把时事变成米姆。但中国社交媒体上的段子也与更广泛的政府战略显露出的信号相吻合，后者希望淡化这一可能让中国感到尴尬、还有可能进一步破坏美中关系的事件。
"The Chinese authorities, who have tried to convince the Americans that their furor over the balloon is an overreaction to a meteorological vessel blown off course, are also deploying their sprawling propaganda apparatus to control discussion at home. By limiting news coverage and curating online conversation, they are working to ensure that the balloon avoids becoming not only an international headache but a domestic one, too.",中国当局一直试图让美国人相信，他们对一个被风吹离航线的气象气球的愤怒是过度反应，同时它还在动用庞大的宣传机器控制国内的讨论。中国政府通过限制新闻报道、管理网上对话的做法，努力确保气球事件不仅不会成为一个国际问题，也不会成为一个国内问题。
"The approach points to the potentially tricky balancing act China faces. Beijing needs to look strong. Anti-American sentiment has risen markedly in recent years, often fanned by the government, and the downing of the Chinese balloon by an American fighter jet stoked some cries for retribution. On Tuesday, after a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized the United States for saying it had no plans to return the balloon's parts to China, social media commenters said China now had ample grounds to treat American vessels however it liked.",政府的做法表明，中国在平衡各方利益上面临着潜在的棘手问题。北京需要做出看上去强硬的姿态。近年来，国内反美情绪明显高涨，这种情绪往往受到政府的煽动，美国战斗机击落中国气球后，已引发了一些人进行报复的呼吁。周二，美国表示没有计划将气球部件归还中国后，中国外交部发言人批评了美国。中国社交媒体上的评论者说，中国现在可以名正言顺地对待任何入侵领空的美国飞行器了。
"But China may be eager to put the balloon behind it. Officials appeared to have been caught off guard by the incident, as shown by their rare expression of regret when first publicly confronted about it. In addition, after three years of harsh coronavirus controls, China is looking to restart its economy and re-enter the global stage an agenda that was supposed to be helped by a visit to Beijing this week by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. Mr. Blinken's visit has now been postponed indefinitely because of the diplomatic uproar over the balloon. The Chinese government may be looking to minimize further damage.",但中国可能也急于将气球事件置于脑后。官员们似乎对这个事件措手不及，表现在他们第一次公开面对气球事件时罕见地表示了遗憾。此外，实行了三年严格控制新冠病毒的措施后，中国正在寻求重启经济、重新步入国际舞台。人们原以为美国国务卿布林肯本周对北京的访问会帮助中国实现这个议程，但气球事件引发外交风波，导致布林肯无限期推迟访问。中国政府可能想尽量减少进一步的损害。
"Its apparent permission of humorous responses over more substantive debate could be an effort to allow an outlet for nationalist feeling, said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.",相比于更实质性的讨论，中国政府似乎允许对事件做出幽默的回应，可能是为了让民族主义情绪有一个发泄的渠道，新加坡国立大学政治学副教授庄嘉颖说。
"""It's probably an effort to mollify domestic sentiment,"" he said, ""but also trying not to let things blow out of control."" He continued: ""I think it's the leadership trying to thread the needle between their different interests.""","""这可能是为了安抚国内情绪，""他说，""但也是为了不让事态失控。""他继续说道:""我认为这是领导层试图在他们的不同利益之间寻找平衡。"""
"A more low-key approach could also help China dodge potentially awkward questions at home about how it lost a Chinese airship, no matter its purpose, and its recent admission of a second it claims also wayward balloon over Colombia. State media has largely avoided covering the saga, other than carrying the foreign ministry's statements.",这种更加低调的做法也可以帮政府在国内避免可能令其尴尬的问题:政府是怎么让一艘中国飞艇走失的，不管其目的是什么;当局最近还承认了第二个其所谓走失的气球，这个气球飘至哥伦比亚上空。官媒除了刊登外交部声明外，基本上避免对此事进行报道。
"China's official narrative and the public response it has helped shape differ sharply from those of other recent incidents that have strained U.S.-China tensions, most notably the visit last August to Taiwan by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Then, Chinese officials and state media egged on the vitriolic nationalism that dominated online, as users called for the military to shoot down her plane or invade Taiwan, which China claims as its own.",与对待其他导致美中紧张关系升级事件的态度相比，中国有关气球事件的官方叙事以及政府帮助塑造的公众反应截然不同，最引人注目的是去年8月，时任美国众议院议长佩洛西对台湾的访问。当时中国官员和官媒煽动了充斥互联网的民族主义愤怒情绪，任由网上用户呼吁中国军队击落佩洛西的飞机或入侵台湾。中国声称对台湾拥有主权。
"There was little sign of a similar official campaign this time, said Xiao Qiang, a researcher on Chinese censorship at the University of California, Berkeley.",这次几乎没有官方发动类似运动的迹象，加州大学伯克利分校研究中国审查制度的研究员萧强说。
"Still, that did not mean there was a lack of interest in the balloon among Chinese users. Various hashtags about it were among the top trending topics on Weibo in recent days; one early hashtag, claiming the balloon had strayed into American airspace by force majeure, racked up 670 million views.",尽管如此，这并不意味着中国用户对气球不感兴趣。最近几天，关于此事的标签纷纷登上微博热门话题榜首;一个声称气球因不可抗力误入美国领空的较早话题标签已经获得了6.7亿次浏览。
"But the tone of many of the posts was humorous. One of the most popular memes declared the vessel ""The Wandering Balloon"" a play on ""The Wandering Earth 2,"" a Chinese science fiction movie currently dominating the country's box office. Users turned photos of the balloon into movie posters. Others edited a pair of chopsticks around the balloon, to emphasize its resemblance to the white sticky rice balls eaten at this time of year.","但很多帖子的语气幽默。最流行的一个米姆称飞艇为""流浪气球""，借用了目前在中国票房大卖的科幻电影《流浪地球2》的名字。用户将气球的照片制作成电影海报。还有人编辑了气球照片，在边上添加了一双筷子，以强调气球与每年这个时候吃的白色汤圆相似。"
"The lighthearted response may have been in part organic, said Manya Koetse, the editor of What's on Weibo, a website that tracks chatter on the Chinese social media platform. The end of Covid restrictions and the recent Lunar New Year holiday, on top of the popularity of the Wandering Earth film (which is about how China saves the world) have likely fed renewed confidence among many Chinese.","追踪中国社交媒体平台上聊天情况的网站What's on Weibo的编辑棵小曼(Manya Koetse)说，这种轻松的回应可能部分是自发的。取消新冠""清零""、最近的春节假期，加上(讲述中国如何拯救世界的)影片《流浪地球2》隆重上映或许重新激发了许多中国人的信心。"
"That confidence was on display in the half-mocking, half-swaggering online jokes that proliferated online. ""Breaking news: Last night, China launched tens of thousands of giant balloons,"" one blogger with 1.2 million followers on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, wrote alongside a video of Lantern Festival festivities.","这种信心体现在充斥网上的半嘲讽、半自大的段子里。""突发新闻，昨晚，中国从云南发射数万个巨型气球，""微博上一名拥有120万个粉丝的博主写道，配的帖子是一段元宵节庆祝活动的视频。"
"""The F-22 doesn't have enough missiles,"" one user replied, referring to the American fighter jet that shot down the balloon.","""F22的导弹不够了，""一名用户评论道，他指的是击落了中国气球的美国战斗机。"
"""They say, 'Oh you feel threatened over a weather balloon that's kind of sad, it shows how scared you are of a rising China,'"" Ms. Koetse said.","""他们说，'哦，你们觉得受到一个气象气球的威胁，这有点可悲，表明你们多么害怕一个崛起的中国，'""棵小曼说。"
"But China's internet is tightly regulated, especially when it comes to hot topics or politics. And on this issue, too, the government was working to guide public opinion.",但中国政府严格监管国内的互联网，尤其是在涉及热门话题或政治时。政府也在努力引导有关气球事件的舆论。
"By Tuesday, the hashtag ""Wandering Balloon"" no longer yielded results, with Weibo citing ""relevant laws and regulations."" Another hashtag, about the second Chinese balloon over Latin America, was also censored after briefly topping the hot search ranking on Monday.","周二，在微博上检索""流浪气球""标签已不再有结果，得到的只是""根据相关法律法规和政策，话题页未予显示""。另一个关于在拉丁美洲上空漂浮的第二个中国气球的话题标签，在周一短暂登上微博热搜榜首后，也受到了审查。"
"There was also relatively little serious analysis about the potential damage to U.S.-China relations, or outright questioning of the government's denial of spying. (Some commenters did express skepticism about whether the balloon had truly been a civilian craft, but obliquely, most likely to duck censorship.)",网上相对较少的是对美中关系可能受到的损害的认真分析，或者对政府否认间谍活动的说法公开质疑的声音。(的确有评论者对气球是否真的是民用飞行器表示怀疑，但表达方式很委婉，很可能为了逃避审查。)
"Those who did offer political analysis largely blamed the United States, focusing on how American domestic politics was creating pressure for President Biden to appear tough on China. The Global Times, a state-owned tabloid and one of the few official publications to weigh in on the debate beyond the foreign ministry's statements, quoted Chinese scholars who argued that the United States was ""hyping"" the incident in order to contain China's rise and try to gain an edge in future negotiations.","那些的确对此事进行政治分析的人主要是指责美国，将注意力集中在美国的国内政治如何给拜登总统施压、要求他对中国表现出强硬态度上。官方出版物除了刊登外交部声明外，几乎没有发表任何跟进评论，中共小报《环球时报》是为数不多的例外，该报引用中国学者的话说，为了遏制中国崛起，争取在未来谈判中占据优势，美国正在""炒作""气球事件。"
"Still, some other more aggressive posts have disappeared. A day before the Global Times piece was published, a different version of the article had appeared on its website, more stridently accusing the United States government of trying to create a new Cold War and manipulating its own people. That one is no longer available.",尽管如此，一些更气势汹汹的帖子已经消失了。《环球时报》在发表上述文章的前一天，其网站上出现过一个不同版本的文章，更激烈地指责美国政府试图制造新冷战、操纵本国人民。该文章已不复存在。
"""They still, to some degree, want to mend the relationship with the U.S., so this is not the time to mobilize the whole internet to go after the United States,"" Mr. Xiao, at Berkeley, said of the Chinese authorities.","""在某种程度上，他们仍想修复与美国的关系，所以现在不是动员全中国的互联网谴责美国的时候，""伯克利大学的萧强谈到中国当局时说。"
"Even if China does not succeed in smoothing over tensions with the United States, at least in the short term, there is another benefit to Beijing in allowing, or forcing, the issue to fade.",就算中国在缓和与美国的紧张关系上不成功，允许或迫使气球事件被淡化对北京来说也有另一个好处，至少从短期来看是如此。
"No matter the true purpose of the operation whether it was a mission for weather data or a spying expedition it clearly was botched. And in a country where the government has encouraged people to reflexively see accusations of Chinese wrongdoing as fabricated, Beijing's acknowledgment of even some truth to the incident prompted some disorientation.",不管气球的真正任务是什么——是采集气象数据还是进行间谍侦察，这显然是一次失败的任务。在中国，政府鼓励人们将任何指责中国不法行为的说法本能地视为捏造，在这个国家，政府承认气球事件的哪怕一点真相也会让一些人无所适从。
"One of the most-liked comments under a state media Weibo post about the foreign ministry's explanation that the balloon had flown off course read simply: ""So it really is from our country ""","微博上的一个官媒帐号刊登了外交部对气球偏离航线的解释后，下面的评论中点赞最多的一条只是简单的一句:""还真是我国的……"""
"Vaguely worded and broad in scope, the law was crafted and enacted from Beijing. It quickly transformed life in Hong Kong.",这部措辞含糊、范围广泛的法律在北京起草和颁布。它迅速改变了香港人的生活。
"Boisterous demonstrations all but disappeared. Newsrooms were raided and shuttered. Labor unions, pro-democracy coalitions and other civil society groups disbanded, one after another.",热情高涨的示威活动消失了。新闻编辑室遭受突击搜查并关闭。工会、民主同盟和其他民间社会团体相继解散。
"Chinese officials have used the national security law, as it is called, to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong, essentially discarding the ""one country, two systems"" pledge that guaranteed the city a high degree of autonomy after Britain gave it back to China. In the last two years, more than 200 people have been arrested under the law, and more than 3,000 have been prosecuted on other charges over their roles in antigovernment protests.","凭借其所称的国家安全法，中国官员镇压了香港的异见，实际上抛弃了自英国将香港归还中国后保证这座城市高度自治的""一国两制""承诺。过去两年间，已有200多人因国安法被捕，另有3000多人因参与反政府抗议而遭受其他指控。"
"Virtually all of Hong Kong's opposition figures, longtime advocates for democracy, were detained on a single day in 2021. Forty-seven of them were charged with subversion under the new law, accused of conspiring in a plot to disrupt the local Beijing-backed government. Now, with most of the defendants having spent nearly two years behind bars, their trial begins on Monday, a stark reminder of how dangerous any kind of organized dissent has become.",香港几乎所有反对派人士和长期民主倡导者都在2021年的同一天被捕。根据这一新法，其中47人以颠覆罪名受到起诉，被控密谋颠覆北京支持的当地政府。如今，大多数被告人身陷囹圄已有近两年，他们的审判于周一开始，这赤裸裸地提醒了人们，任何有组织的异议已经变得多么危险。
"Here's what to know about the law and the Hong Kong 47, as the defendants are often called.","以下是关于国安法和这些被告人的介绍，他们通常被称为""香港47人""。"
The law was drafted in secret.,秘密起草的法律。
"Free speech and judicial independence have long been cherished in Hong Kong and are protected under the Basic Law, as the city's mini-constitution is known. But the Chinese government, which administers Hong Kong as a semiautonomous territory, sees those principles as secondary to its control.",多年来，香港珍视言论自由和司法独立，这些权利受到该市的小宪法《基本法》保护。但在将香港当作半自治地区管理的中国政府看来，比起对香港的控制，这些原则需退居次要地位。
"In 2003, not long after Hong Kong was returned to China, local pro-Beijing officials tried to pass security legislation. But a draft of the bill raised fears that civil liberties and human rights would be diminished. The legislation was shelved after a mass demonstration.",2003年，香港回归中国后不久，亲北京的当地官员就试图通过国家安全立法。但该立法的草案引发了对公民自由和人权将被削弱的担忧。这项立法在大规模示威后被搁置。
"The Chinese authorities took a different approach in 2020. A year earlier, a bill in Hong Kong that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China had set off months of protests. To pre-empt another wave of dissent, Beijing drafted the security law in secret, bypassing Hong Kong's legislature. Its provisions were revealed a day before the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China. The law took effect immediately, a warning to the many residents who often marked the anniversary with pro-democracy protests.",2020年，中国当局采取了不同的办法。此前一年，香港一项允许将罪犯引渡中国大陆的的法案引发了持续数月的抗议。为防止异议再次发生，北京先发制人，绕过香港立法会秘密起草了国安法。该法案的条款在香港回归23周年纪念日的前一天才被公布。该法案立即生效，向许多经常在这一纪念日参加民主抗议的居民发出了警告。
The 47 democrats were charged over an election.,导致47名民主人士遭起诉的选举。
"The main defendant in the case is Benny Tai, a law professor and leader of the Occupy Central movement in 2014, which demanded freer elections.","此案的主要被告是法学教授戴耀廷，他在2014年领导了""占中运动""，要求更自由的选举。"
"Since 2019, Mr. Tai had argued that the pro-democracy camp should hold an unofficial primary election, to find out who its most electable candidates were. Under his strategy, if the democrats could gain a majority in the legislature, they could block the government's budget, which by law would have forced an ouster of Carrie Lam, then the city's deeply unpopular leader.",2019年后，戴耀廷认为，香港民主派应该举行非正式的初选，以确定最有可能当选的候选人。根据他的策略，若民主派能在立法会获得多数席位，就可以否决政府财政预算案，按照法律规定，这将迫使当时在香港极不受欢迎的领导人林郑月娥下台。
"The primary was held in July 2020, and turnout was high, despite the authorities' declaration that it could violate the new security law. The charges against the Hong Kong 47 center on the primary and Mr. Tai's broader plan, which is being called a subversive plot to paralyze the government.","尽管当局宣称此举可能违反新的国安法，初选仍于2020年7月举行，投票率非常高。针对""香港47人""的指控主要集中在这场初选和戴耀廷更广泛的计划之上，他的计划被称为旨在令政府瘫痪的颠覆性串谋。"
"The case has ensnared longtime opponents of the Chinese government like Joshua Wong, who become world-famous as a teenage student leader during the 2014 ""Umbrella Movement"" protests for freer elections of the city's leader.","此案牵涉到其他长期反对中国政府的人，比如在2014年""雨伞运动""中举世闻名的青年学生领袖黄之锋，当时这场抗议要求更自由地选举香港领导人。"
"Several other defendants, like Claudia Mo, Eddie Chu and Lam Cheuk-ting, were veteran lawmakers who had been at the forefront of Hong Kong's democracy movement for years. Others, like Gwyneth Ho, Owen Chow and Winnie Yu, represented a newer generation of activists and unionists, politicized in the wake of the 2019 protests.",其他多名被告，如毛孟静、朱凯迪和林卓廷，都是多年来一直站在香港民主运动前沿的立法会资深议员。何桂蓝、邹家成和余慧明等另一些人则代表了更年轻一代的活动人士和工会支持者，他们在2019年抗议活动后开始走向政治。
The trial is meant to send a message.,意在传达信息的审判。
"Analysts said the case demonstrated the wide reach of the national security law, which the authorities initially said would only affect a small minority of the city.",分析人士表示，此案表明国安法的影响范围甚广，当局最初表示该法律只会影响香港一小部分人。
"""It's hard to overestimate the enormity of this case, because it's basically meant to be a knockout blow to Hong Kong's peaceful political mainstream opposition,"" said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law.","""此案的严重性不可小觑，因为它基本上是对香港和平的主流政治反对派发出了致命一击，""亚洲法律中心执行主任托马斯·凯洛格说。"
"""This is a real choice by the Hong Kong government and Beijing,"" he continued. ""They could have focused on people who were talking about independence, for example, or people who had been more harshly critical of Hong Kong government policy and Beijing's policy toward Hong Kong. Instead, they have gone after every sector of civic life.""","""这是港府和北京真正的选择，""他还说。""他们本可以仅针对那些主张独立的人，或是对港府政策及北京的香港政策提出更严厉批评的人。结果，他们连公民生活的各个层面都没有放过。"""
"The mass arrests of the democrats, in January 2021, was followed by an overhaul of the city's elections, with new laws to root out candidates who could be deemed disloyal to Beijing. The city ran a ""patriots-only"" election that December, and in 2022 a legislature was installed whose members were all pro-Beijing, except one.","2021年1月，民主派人士遭到大规模逮捕，此后香港选举制度迎来全面改革，制定了新法律，以铲除可能被视为不忠于北京的候选人。香港于12月举行了""仅限爱国者""的选举，并在2022年选出了一届只有一位成员不是亲北京派的立法会。"
"""It really tells the world that as long as you are in alignment with the pro-democracy movement, you will be considered a criminal,"" said Eric Lai, an expert in Hong Kong law.","""这就是在向所有人宣示，只要与民主运动结盟，就会被视为罪犯，""研究香港法律的专家黎恩灏表示。"
Many of the 47 defendants have indicated that they will plead guilty.,47名被告中的许多人已表示将认罪。
"Eva Pils, a law professor at King's College London, said guilty pleas would allow China to argue that the ""wrongdoers"" had seen the error of their ways. ""Part of the purpose of that messaging operation is to normalize the criminalization of political dissent in Hong Kong,"" she said.","伦敦国王学院法学教授艾华(Eva Pils)表示，认罪会让中国有理由宣称，这些""不法分子""已经认识到自己的错误。""传递这种信号的部分目的，在于将香港政治异议的刑事定罪常规化，""她说。"
Many protest tactics are banned under the security law.,许多抗议行为都被国安法禁止。
"Many of the offenses listed under the national security law are tactics that Hong Kong protesters used in 2019, such as disrupting public transport and vandalizing government property.",国安法列出的许多罪名都是香港抗议者在2019年的抗议手段，例如扰乱公共交通和毁坏政府财产。
"While adding a vast security apparatus to the city, the law also introduced socialist legal concepts to Hong Kong's common law system, targeting four types of crime. They are:",在这座城市增设规模庞大的安全机构的同时，该法律还针对四种犯罪类型，将社会主义法律概念引入了香港的普通法制度，分别是:
Secession: speech or actions advocating Hong Kong's independence from China.,分裂国家罪:主张香港独立于中国的言论或行为。
"Subversion: undermining the authority of the Chinese central government, including disrupting its activities and vandalizing its offices.",颠覆国家政权罪:对中国中央政府政权进行破坏，包括干扰机关职能履行和破坏机关设施的行为。
Terrorist activities: violence and disruptions to public services for political purposes.,恐怖活动罪:出于政治目的对公共服务的暴力和干扰破坏。
"Collusion with a foreign country or with ""external elements"": receiving help from foreign countries, institutions and individuals in imposing sanctions against China, rigging local elections or inciting hatred toward the government.","勾结外国或""境外势力"":接受外国或境外机构和人员支援，对中国进行制裁，操纵地方选举或煽动对政府的仇恨。"
"Prison sentences under the law can be harsh. Defendants convicted as ""principal offenders"" can be imprisoned for life, ""active"" participants face up to 10 years and minor players can be put away for up to three years.","国安法的刑罚可能非常严厉。被定为""首要分子""的被告被判无期徒刑，""积极""参与者最高面临十年监禁，情节轻微者最高被判三年有期徒刑。"
Hong Kong's judicial system has changed dramatically.,香港司法制度发生了翻天覆地的变化。
The security law has allowed Beijing to exert unprecedented control over Hong Kong.,国安法让北京得以对香港施加前所未有的控制。
"With its implementation in 2020 came a web of new national security divisions within the city's police force and prosecutor's office. Chinese security forces were allowed to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time, from a newly created base. This apparatus is led by a national security committee that includes Hong Kong's chief executive, as well as Beijing's top representative in the city.",随着该法律在2020年实施，香港警务和律政机关设立了一系列新的国家安全部门。中国国安首次得以在香港的新设机构公开活动。该机构由一个国家安全委员会领导，香港行政长官和北京驻港最高官员都是委员会成员。
"The language of the law also gives Beijing the final say on how it should be interpreted, in effect circumventing decisions made in Hong Kong courts. The chief executive, the city's Beijing-appointed leader, selects the judges who are allowed to hear national security cases. The law also takes precedence should it come into conflict with other laws.",该法律的措辞也让北京对如何解释法律拥有最终决定权，实际上绕过了香港法院的裁决。由北京任命的香港行政长官负责选择获准审理国家安全案件的法官。如果与其他法律发生冲突，该法律也具有优先权。
"The vast majority of the people charged under the law have been accused of speech crimes, like calling for Hong Kong's independence or for sanctions against China. Most have been denied bail, which is difficult to obtain under the law.",依据国安法遭到起诉的绝大多数人都是因言获罪，例如呼吁香港独立或对中国进行制裁。大多数人的保释申请都被拒绝，因为这在该法律下很难获得。
"This year will also see the trial of perhaps Beijing's highest-profile target in Hong Kong: the media mogul Jimmy Lai, a strident critic of the Chinese government. Critics say that his case demonstrates the erosion of free speech, journalism and judicial independence in Hong Kong in one fell swoop. His trial is scheduled for September.",今年面临审判的，可能还有北京在香港知名度最高的打击对象，他就是中国政府的尖锐批评者，媒体大亨黎智英。批评人士称，他的案件表明香港的言论自由、新闻自由和司法独立通通受到侵蚀。黎智英案的审理定于9月进行。
Four members of China's two most prestigious academic institutions died in October in line with the average in recent years.,10月，中国两个最负盛名的学术机构中有四名学者去世，人数与往年相比无异。
These are some of the country's most decorated scientists. The academies publish obituaries to memorialize their contributions.,他们是中国屡获殊荣的科学家。两个机构发布讣告以纪念他们的贡献。
"In November, Covid cases surged across the country.",11月，新冠病例在全国激增。
"Then, on Dec. 8, China abandoned its tight Covid restrictions.",然后，在12月8日，中国放弃了对新冠的严格限制。
"The obituaries began accumulating. As the weeks went on, they shot up. A total of 40 scholars died in the past two months.",讣告开始越来越多，数量在几周内猛增。过去两个月共有40名学者去世。
We examined the obituaries published over the past four years by the state-backed Chinese Academy of Engineering and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.,我们检查了过去四年有政府背景的中国工程院和中国科学院发表的讣告。
"The academies' members, who are drawn from research institutions across the country, help shape national policy and steer research priorities. The engineering academy currently has about 900 members, and the science academy about 800, according to their websites.",这两所学院的成员来自全国各地的研究机构，他们帮助制定国家政策并引导研究重点。根据它们的网站，中国工程院目前约有900名成员，中国科学院约有800名成员。
"The obituaries did not specify the scholars' causes of death beyond ""illness,"" and the academies did not answer requests for more specifics. But the spike late last year coincided with the coronavirus's rapid spread across the country.","除了""因病逝世""，讣告没有具体说明学者们的死因，这些学院也没有回答更具体的问题。但去年年底的讣告激增恰逢新冠病毒在全国迅速传播时期。"
"Infections had already begun rising in the fall, despite China's strict ""zero Covid"" policy of lockdowns and mass testing. Then, after the government suddenly abandoned the policy in early December, amid a flailing economy and protests in multiple cities, cases soared.","尽管中国通过严格封锁和大规模检测实施了""清零""政策，但感染人数已在秋季开始上升。然后，多个城市爆发抗议活动，经济不景气，政府于12月初突然放弃该政策，此后病例激增。"
"During that chaotic period, hospitals turned away patients and funeral homes staggered under the number of bodies. The government's accounting, however, did not reflect those tragic scenes for weeks it reported just three dozen deaths and it drew widespread criticism for a lack of transparency.",在那段混乱时期，医院将病人拒之门外，殡仪馆因遗体太多而超负荷运转。然而，这些悲惨的场景并没有通过政府报告的数字体现——政府几周来只报告了30多例死亡，并因缺乏透明度而招致广泛批评。
"The government has released more data in recent weeks, saying it recorded about 80,000 deaths since it lifted Covid restrictions. Still, many experts say that figure is likely an undercount, as it includes only people who died in hospitals; some have estimated that the death toll in China could exceed 1 million people in the coming months.",政府最近几周发布了更多数据，称自取消新冠限制以来录得约8万人死亡。尽管如此，许多专家表示这个数字可能被低估了，因为它只包括在医院死亡的人;有人估计，未来几个月，中国的死亡人数可能会超过100万。
"On Chinese social media, users have pointed to the skyrocketing number of obituaries published by places like the two academies, to suggest that the true number of deaths is much higher than the official figure.",在中国社交媒体上，用户指出，类似机构发布的讣告数量激增，表明真实死亡人数远高于官方数字。
"Any count is likely to be incomplete because the government has largely abandoned Covid testing, including in hospitals, said Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. ""The reality is that even the government might not know everything,"" he said.","香港大学病毒学家金冬雁说，由于政府基本上已经放弃了新冠病毒检测，包括在医院进行的检测，所以任何计数可能都不完整。""现实情况是，即使政府也可能不知道全部情况，""他说。"
"""It's the government's job"" to gather and share accurate information, Dr. Jin continued. ""But they're not doing their job.""","金冬雁还说，收集和分享准确信息是""政府的工作""。""但他们没有做好自己的工作。"""
"The deceased included molecular biologists, nuclear physicists and experts in agricultural chemistry. One academy member, Ma Jianzhang, 86, was a wildlife scientist who specialized in Siberian tigers. He helped establish the country's only college for wildlife and nature reserves, and led groups including the China Zoological Society and the China Wildlife Conservation Association.",逝世者包括分子生物学家、核物理学家和农业化学专家。86岁的院士马建章是一位专门研究东北虎的野生动物科学家。他帮助建立了中国唯一的野生动物和自然保护学院，并领导了包括中国动物学会和中国野生动物保护协会在内的团体。
"Reached by phone, a relative of Professor Ma said that she did not know whether he had contracted Covid, because he had not been tested. He had other underlying diseases, she added.",记者通过电话联系到马建章教授的一位亲属，她说不知道他是否感染了新冠病毒，因为他没有做过检测。她补充说，他还有其他基础疾病。
"""To the outside world, he may be someone with great achievements or influence,"" the relative, Fu Qun, said. ""To our family, he was more important as a sort of spiritual leader. We all respected him very much.""","""对外界来讲可能是有功勋伟业什么影响的人，""这位名叫符群的亲属说，""对我们家人来讲，更重视的他是一个精神引领，精神领袖一样的存在，我们都非常敬重他。"""
The data drawn from the obituaries are far from conclusive. The institutions also did not answer questions about whether the obituaries both during the outbreak and before were exhaustive of all scholars who had died.,从讣告中获得的远非确凿数据。这些讣告是否详尽无遗地列出了所有已故学者，两所学院无论是在爆发期间还是之前，都没有回答这一问题。
"Still, obituaries published by other institutions showed similar spikes in late December and early January.",尽管如此，其他学术机构发布的讣告数量在12月底和1月初也出现了类似的飙升。
"From 2019 to 2021, the Harbin Institute of Technology, one of the top engineering schools in the world, had published between one and three obituaries for professors and staff members in those months. Between December and last month, it announced 29 deaths.",在世界顶尖工程学院之一的哈尔滨工业大学，2019年到2021年，在当年的那几个月，共发布了一到三篇教授和教职员工的讣告。从去年12月到上个月，该校宣布有29人死亡。
"University-wide obituaries were not publicly available for Peking University, one of China's most prestigious. But some individual departments published obituaries for their own professors and staff.",北京大学是中国最负盛名的大学之一，大学范围内的讣告并未公开。但个别部门为自己的教授和教职员工发布了讣告。
"Those who died included Luo Xiaochun, 68, a former director of the library for the Foreign Languages department; Zhao Binghua, 91, a founder of Peking University's nursing school, who had recalled juggling housework and care for her two children with her duties as a pediatrician in the 1960s; and Guo Xiliang, 93, a linguist who had continued publishing books on ancient Chinese phonetics into his 90s.",逝者包括68岁的外国语学院原图书馆馆长罗晓春;91岁的北京大学护理学院创始人赵炳华，她曾在一次专访中回忆起1960年代担任儿科医生时兼顾家务和照顾两个孩子;93岁的语言学家郭锡良，他在90多岁时仍在继续出版有关汉字古音的书籍。
"Professor Guo had been infected with the coronavirus when he died, according to Zhang Meng, a former student and colleague of the professor at Peking University.",据北京大学郭锡良教授的前学生兼同事张猛说，郭教授去世时感染了新冠病毒。
"In December, both Peking University and Tsinghua University, another top-ranked school in Beijing, issued notices urging greater protection for retired faculty and staff.",去年12月，北京大学和北京另一所顶尖大学清华大学都发布了通知，敦促加强对退休教职工的保护。
"Chinese health officials have said that the outbreak peaked in late December and that cases are steadily declining. But the country has still not addressed many of the underlying issues in its health system, such as less effective vaccines and insufficient hospital beds, said Professor Jin, in Hong Kong.",中国卫生官员表示，疫情在12月下旬达到顶峰，病例正在稳步下降。但在香港的金冬雁表示，中国仍未解决其卫生系统中的许多根本问题，例如疫苗效果不佳和病床不足。
"""That means, even if you have very small spikes in the future, more people will still die,"" he said. ""If they don't learn their lesson, that would be the new situation.""","""这意味着，即使未来出现非常小的峰值，仍然会有更多人死亡，""他说。""如果他们不吸取教训，就会出现那样的新情况。"""
"The political candidates represented the vanguard of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Numbering in the dozens, they had planned to run for the city's legislature in 2020, after months of turbulent protests calling for greater freedom from China.",这些政治候选人代表了香港民主运动的先锋。2020年，数十人计划竞选香港的立法机关，此前，香港经历了数月的动荡抗议，要求从中国获得更大的自由。
"By the time the election was held, more than a year later, none of the candidates could run. Most were in jail, where many still languish today, charged with subversion in the largest case yet involving the national security law Beijing imposed on the city in 2020. Their arrests laid bare the lengths to which China's government would go to crush dissent in Hong Kong, which was long accustomed to many of the freedoms of speech and assembly found in the West.",一年多后举行选举时，他们当中无人能够参选。大多数人入狱，许多人至今仍在监狱里受苦，他们被控颠覆国家政权罪，这是迄今为止涉及北京2020年对香港实施的国家安全法的最大案件。他们的被捕暴露出中国政府镇压香港异议的不遗余力，香港长期以来习惯于拥有许多常见于西方的言论和集会自由。
"After years of fits and starts, the trial involving the 47 pro-democracy lawmakers, academics and activists began on Monday at a courthouse in Hong Kong amid tight security. Large police vehicles lined the roads nearby as a line of more than 100 people snaked around the courthouse in the early morning, waiting to enter. Because there were so many defendants, the court broadcast the proceedings into several other rooms.",经过多年时断时续的进展，涉及47名亲民主立法者、学者和活动人士的审判于周一在香港一家安保严密的法院开始。一大早，100多人在法院外排起蜿蜒的长队等待进入，附近的道路停满大型警车。由于被告人数众多，法院在另外几个房间转播了庭审过程。
"Of the 47 defendants, only 16 are contesting the charges. The rest entered guilty pleas, including Joshua Wong, one of the most globally recognized Hong Kong pro-democracy figures, and Benny Tai, a former law professor. As one of the defendants, Ng Kin-wai, a former district official, took the stand, he declared, sarcastically: ""I tried to commit subversion against the totalitarian regime, but failed. I plead guilty.""","在47名被告中，只有16人对指控提出异议，其余人都表示认罪，其中包括全球最知名的香港民主派人士之一黄之锋和前法学教授戴耀廷。作为被告之一，前区议员伍健伟出庭，他讽刺地宣称:""我试图颠覆极权政权，但失败了。我认罪。"""
"Most of the defendants, if not all, are expected to receive prison sentences, which could range from less than three years to life.",预计大多数甚至所有被告都将被判处有期徒刑，刑期从三年以下到终身监禁不等。
"""The trial of the 47 represents a turning point in the crackdown because it reveals the true purpose of the national security law,"" said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame who studies Hong Kong.","""对47人的审判代表了镇压的一个转折点，因为它揭示了国家安全法的真正目的，""研究香港的圣母大学政治学副教授许田波说。"
"""They're not targeting a small minority of people throwing petrol bombs,"" Professor Hui said. ""Those people have already been arrested. Instead, they're targeting the legitimate opposition, people who believed there was still a little bit left to defend of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom.""","""他们不是针对一小部分扔汽油弹的人，""许田波说。""那些人已经被逮捕了。相反，他们针对的是合法的反对派，那些认为还有一点余地可以捍卫香港自治和自由的人。"""
"Already, the defendants' arrests and lengthy detention have dealt a blow to the remaining vestiges of civil society. The 47 defendants, who comprise 42 opposition candidates and five election organizers, come from a cross-section of Hong Kong politicians, academics, union organizers and journalists.",被告的逮捕和长期拘留已经对残存的公民社会造成了打击。47名被告包括42名反对党候选人和五名选举组织者，他们来自香港的各个阶层——政治人物、学者、工会组织者和记者。
"They include Claudia Mo, 66, a veteran journalist-turned-politician known to many as ""Auntie Mo""; Eddie Chu, 45, a former legislator and early champion of the city's ""localist"" movement, which aimed to preserve Hong Kong's identity; Carol Ng, 52, an ex-flight attendant and labor activist; and Gwyneth Ho, 32, a former journalist, who famously reported from the scene of a mob attack on antigovernment demonstrators trapped in a subway station.","他们包括66岁的毛孟静，她从资深记者转型为参政者，被许多人称为""毛姨姨"";朱凯廸，45岁，前立法会议员，也是香港""本土行动""的早期倡导者，该运动旨在维护香港的身份认同;吴敏儿，52岁，前空姐和劳工活动人士;以及32岁的何桂蓝，她曾是一名记者，因在现场报道过暴民袭击被困地铁站的反政府示威者而知名。"
To take stock of the group's plight is to recognize how much Hong Kong has been transformed since pro-democracy protests erupted in 2019.,盘点这群人的困境，就能理解到自2019年民主抗议活动爆发以来，香港发生了多大的变化。
"China's subsequent crackdown brought changes that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago: an ideological makeover of the public education system; the demise of one of Asia's most staunchly independent media industries; the arrest of Hong Kong's highest-ranking Roman Catholic cleric, the nonagenarian Cardinal Joseph Zen; and the erasure of political opposition in Hong Kong's legislature, paving the way for passage of pro-Beijing laws like a ""patriots only"" litmus test for political candidates. The high degree of autonomy Hong Kong was promised for 50 years after Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997 has all but eroded.","中国随后的镇压带来了几年前无法想象的变化:公共教育系统的意识形态改造;亚洲最坚定的独立媒体行业之一的消亡;香港最高级别的罗马天主教神职人员、九十多岁的枢机主教陈日君被捕;以及香港立法机构中的政治反对派被消除，为亲北京的立法铺平道路，例如对政治候选人进行""爱国者治港""的资格审查。这个英国前殖民地于1997年归还中国后，北京承诺50年不变的高度自治权几乎被侵蚀殆尽。"
"No change, however, has been more dramatic than those taking place in Hong Kong's legal system, which has been superseded by the national security law a harsh reality being felt acutely by the 47 democrats.",然而，没有比香港法律体系发生的变化更引人注目的了，香港的法律体系已被国家安全法所取代——47名民主人士正深切地感受到这个严酷的现实。
"They are charged with trying to subvert state power for their roles in an unofficial ""primary election."" The poll was an attempt by the opposition to select its best candidates, as part of a last-ditch effort to win enough seats in the legislature to block the government's budget. The budget maneuver, sanctioned under Hong Kong law, could have dissolved the legislature and forced Carrie Lam, then the city's top official, to step down.","他们因在非官方的民主派""初选""中起到的作用而被控试图颠覆国家政权。那次民意调查是反对派选出最佳候选人的一次尝试，作为在立法机构中赢得足够席位以阻止政府预算的最后努力的一部分。根据香港法律，否决预算案可能会使立法机关解散，并迫使时任香港最高官员的林郑月娥下台。"
"Nearly three-quarters of the 47 democrats are currently in jail and, in most cases, have been since they were formally charged nearly two years ago, on Feb. 28, 2021. Such long detention is unusual for Hong Kong, where defendants in other types of cases are often able to get bail. The national security law's sweeping provisions, however, include a high threshold for bail, which in effect lets the authorities hold defendants for months or even years before trial. Critics say that amounts to a presumption that defendants are guilty.",这47名民主派人士中有近四分之三的人目前正被拘禁，其中大多都是在近两年前，即2021年2月28日遭正式起诉的。如此长时间的拘禁在香港是不同寻常的，在其他类型的案件中，被告往往能够获得保释。然而，国安法的全面规定包括极高的保释门槛，实际上允许当局在审判前将被告关押数月乃至数年。批评人士称，这相当于推定被告罪名成立。
"Supporters of the activists say their detention has caused enormous mental strain, particularly for those held in solitary confinement. Some of them are already in prison, serving sentences on other charges. Sam Cheung, a 27-year-old elected official representing a small district, missed the birth of his first child. Tiffany Yuen, 29, another district official, was not permitted to leave prison for the funeral of her grandmother.",这些活动人士的支持者说，尤其是对那些被单独关押的人来说，拘禁造成了巨大的精神压力。其中一些人已经因其他罪名入狱服刑。代表一个小规模选区的27岁民选区议员张可森错过了他第一个孩子的出生。另一名29岁的区议员袁嘉蔚被禁止离开监狱参加祖母的葬礼。
"Mr. Tai, the former law professor, is expected to receive the harshest sentence at the end of the 90-day trial because of his role devising the plan to hold the primary election.",因其在制定初选计划上发挥的作用，前法学教授戴耀廷预计将在为期90天的审判结束时获得最严厉的判决。
"The security law requires judges to impose minimum sentences anywhere from three to 10 years, but defendants can receive lighter punishments if they testify against others. Prosecutors have already indicated that three of the 47 democrats who helped organize the primary had agreed to provide testimony.",根据国安法规定，法官可判处三至10年不等的最低刑期，但如果被告指证他人，则可从轻处罚。检方已经表示，47名民主派中已有三人同意提供证词。
"Activists and legal experts say the strategy is designed to sow mistrust among the defendants and, combined with the grueling detentions, break their morale, to make them more willing to cooperate with prosecutors. The coercive tactic, scholars say, highlights another way that Hong Kong is adopting norms from mainland China.",活动人士和法律专家表示，这样的策略是为了在被告之间播下不信任的种子，加之条件艰苦的拘禁，从而打击他们的士气，让他们更愿意与检方合作。学者称，这种胁迫策略凸显了香港承袭大陆规范的另一种方式。
"""So far as you get a guilty plea, that gives the regime the opportunity to make the point that these wrongdoers have known the error in their ways,"" said Eva Pils, a law scholar at Kings College London who studies China.","""只要你认罪，就让政权有机会表明，这些不法分子已经知错，""伦敦国王学院研究中国问题的法律学者艾华(Eva Pils)表示。"
"By pressuring the defendants individually, the authorities also undermine the democracy movement overall, said Ted Hui, a former lawmaker who fled Hong Kong a month before the 47 were arrested.",在这47人被捕前一个月逃离香港的前立法会议员许智峰说，通过向被告个人施压，当局也打击了整个民主运动。
"While acknowledging the emotional distress the group was under, Mr. Hui said that for any defendant to provide evidence that could implicate another would amount to a betrayal.",许智峰承认，这群人正承受着精神上的痛苦，但他表示，只要被告供出可能牵连他人的证据，这种行为都相当于背叛。
"""I understand the circumstances, but I'm still angry and heartbroken,"" Mr. Hui said by telephone from Adelaide, Australia. ""I also cannot say it's entirely their fault, because the circumstances are created by the pressures of the regime. This has hurt the democracy movement. That is one of the goals achieved by the regime to divide us.""","""我理解他们的处境，但仍然感到愤怒和痛心，""许智峰在澳大利亚阿德莱德接受电话采访时表示。""我也不能说都是他们的错，因为这是政府的压力造成的。这伤害了民主运动。政权已经达到了他们的一个目的，那就是分裂我们。"""
The trial has stirred difficult and complicated emotions within the small community of lawmakers and activists who were able to flee Hong Kong before they could be arrested.,对于在被捕之前得以逃离香港的小部分立法会议员和活动人士，这场审判激起了他们苦涩而复杂的情绪。
"Nathan Law, a prominent pro-democracy advocate and candidate in the primary election who escaped days before the passage of the national security law, said it was painful to read about close friends and fellow activists such as Mr. Wong facing long prison terms.",罗冠聪是著名民主倡导者和初选候选人，他在国安法通过的前几天逃离。听说好友及活动伙伴将面临长期监禁，他的感受是痛苦的。
"""They were just participating in a primary election,"" Mr. Law said from London. ""None of us would think of that as something that would be named as subversion that could lead to years of imprisonment.""","""他们只不过参加了一场初选，""身处伦敦的罗冠聪说。""谁都没有想到这会被冠上颠覆的帽子，可能引来多年牢狱之灾。"""
"""Through these cases, you also understand that the Hong Kong we used to know is gone,"" he said.","""通过这些案件，你也能明白，我们所知的香港已经不复存在，""他说。"
"The trial of the 47 is one of several national security cases winding their way through Hong Kong's courts. Few have attracted more attention than that of Jimmy Lai, the 75-year-old founder of the tabloid newspaper Apple Daily, which was forced to close down in 2021. Mr. Lai, a longtime critic of China's ruling Communist Party, has been serving a five-year, nine-month sentence on what human rights groups say are trumped-up charges of fraud. He is also facing trial on the national security offense of colluding with foreign forces.",对这47人的审判是香港法庭审理的多起国家安全案件之一。其中受关注最多者莫过于75岁的《苹果日报》创始人黎智英，这份小报于2021年被迫停刊。长期以来，黎智英一直是中国执政的共产党的批评者，他被判处五年零九个月的有期徒刑，人权组织称他受到了莫须有的欺诈指控。他还面临勾结境外势力危害国家安全的罪名。
"The ratcheting-up of prosecutions marks the beginning of a new, more authoritarian era in Hong Kong, observers say, one in which political persecution will be used to strike fear in people so that few will consider protesting or challenging Beijing's authority again.",观察人士表示，越来越多的起诉标志着香港进入了一个更加威权主义的新时代。在这个时代，政治迫害将被用来制造恐惧，让愿意抗议或挑战北京权威的人越来越少。
"""What they're trying to do is to redraw the lines of acceptable, peaceful political activity,"" said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law.","""他们想要实现的是重新划定和平政治活动的可接受范围，""亚洲法律中心执行主任托马斯·凯洛格说。"
The Chinese balloon that bumbled its way across the United States has launched a thousand questions about its real intent.,莫名其妙地飘过美国上空的中国气球已引发了上千个有关其真实意图的问题。
But it is also focusing the world's attention on the prospect that the communications and control within Chinese leader Xi Jinping's government and his vaunted security apparatus may be less coherent or even less functional than the image he so confidently projects.,但气球事件也正在让世界关注一个可能性，即中国领导人习近平政府内部的沟通和控制，以及他大肆吹嘘的安全机构，也许并不像他如此自信地展现给世界的那样有条理，甚至不如人们想象的那样起作用。
"The stakes today are high. Relations between Washington and Beijing have frayed, and competition between the two sides has intensified, fueling fears that the wrong move could spark an accidental confrontation between the powerful rivals.",风险如今大为增加。华盛顿与北京的关系已经恶化，双方竞争加剧，这增加了人们对于一个失误动作可能引发两个强大对手无意间发生冲突的担忧。
"The United States says the vessel was a ""high-altitude surveillance balloon."" China maintains it was a civilian airship that had flown off course while gathering meteorological data. Whether the inflatable craft was there by mistake or a brazen military stunt, its emergence raises questions about how China is navigating its growing position as a global power.","美国称飞行器是""高空监视气球""。中国则坚称那是在收集气象数据过程中偏离了航线的民用飞艇。无论该充气艇进入美国领空是误入还是肆无忌惮的军事冒险行动，它的出现已引发了有关中国如何正确处理自己日益增长的全球大国地位的疑问。"
"""What has been particularly damaging for China, both internationally and domestically, are the questions this raises about competence and how they're reinforcing doubts about Xi Jinping's leadership,"" said Susan Shirk, a former deputy assistant secretary of state during the Clinton administration and author of a recent book, ""Overreach: How China Derailed Its Peaceful Rise.""","""对中国来说，这件事在国际上和国内尤具破坏性的是，它引发了有关中国政府能力的疑问，以及这些问题会如何加深人们对习近平领导力的怀疑，""曾在克林顿政府担任副助理国务卿的谢淑丽(Susan Shirk)说，她是最近出版的《越界:中国如何破坏其和平崛起》一书的作者。"
"It's unclear to what degree the incident was avoidable, but it comes at a time when Mr. Xi is thought to be at the peak of his powers after having shattered norms last year by securing a third term and making national security a cornerstone of his rule.",目前还不清楚气球事件在多大程度上可以避免的，但事件发生在人们认为习近平正处于权力顶峰的时候。他在去年打破常规，获得了国家最高领导人的第三个任期，并将国家安全作为他统治的基石。
"With Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken canceling his trip to Beijing, Mr. Xi missed an opportunity to push back against the mounting pressure Washington is applying on China through security ties with partners across Asia and restrictions on semiconductor technology. That would have allowed Mr. Xi to devote more attention to pressing domestic matters such as reviving China's weakened economy.",美国国务卿布林肯取消了北京之行，让习近平失去了要求美国减少施压的机会。华盛顿正在通过加强与亚洲盟友的安全伙伴关系、限制向中国出口半导体技术等做法，向中国施加越来越大的压力。促使美国减少施压本可能会让习近平把更多注意力放在紧迫的国内事务上，比如重振中国疲软的经济。
"The balloon incident follows other apparent miscalculations, including the haphazard unwinding of his, at times, suffocating ""zero Covid"" measures following widespread protests, and his agreeing to a ""no limits"" partnership with Russia only weeks before the invasion of Ukraine.","气球事件发生之前，还存在其他明显误判，包括在有时令人窒息的习近平新冠""清零""政策在全国各地引发抗议后，政府杂乱无章地将其取消，以及在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的几周前，习近平同意与俄罗斯建立""无止境""的伙伴关系。"
"""It's really quite a paradox if you think about it, because it's the beginning of his third term,"" Ms. Shirk added. ""He should be at the high point. And yet we see all of this negative feedback.""","""如果仔细想想的话，事情真的相当令人不可思议，因为它发生在习近平第三个任期开始之际，""谢淑丽补充道。""他应该处于最好的状态。然而我们看到的却都是这种负面反馈。"""
Questions about Mr. Xi's judgment and that of his military and intelligence services now cloud assessments about how China would handle another crisis in a far more dangerous setting such as over the heavily militarized Taiwan Strait a foreboding scenario given the growing probability of a confrontation as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a great power rivalry.,对习近平判断力的质疑，以及对他的军事和情报部门判断力的疑问，让人们难以评估中国在更危险的环境里(比如高度军事化的台湾海峡)如何处理类似危机的问题，考虑到正处在大国竞争之中的美中发生对抗的可能性越来越大，这是个令人不安的预兆。
"In the past, the Chinese government ""could adapt flexibly to a problem. They put economic development first,"" Ms. Shirk said. ""That just hasn't been the case under Xi Jinping in the last few years. So that means you can't predict the future. That's the reason we all feel it's a much more dangerous situation.""","过去，中国政府""能灵活应对问题，把经济发展放在首位""，谢淑丽说。""在习近平领导下，过去几年的情况已不再是这样。因此这意味着无法预测未来。这就是为什么我们都认为情况更加危险的原因。"""
"That unpredictability appears to have extended to China's most recent response to the balloon, which was dramatically shot out of the air by a U.S. fighter jet on Saturday. After first expressing regret for the balloon's emergence, China hardened its stance on Monday.",这种不可预测性似乎已延伸到中国最近对气球事件的反应，美国战斗机已在上周六引人注目地将其从空中击落。中国最初曾对气球出现在美国领空表示了遗憾，但后来在周一采取了更强硬的立场。
"Xie Feng, a vice foreign minister, lodged a protest with the American Embassy in Beijing, chastising the United States for destroying the vessel and accusing Washington of reversing the progress made in improving relations after Mr. Xi and President Biden met face-to-face in November in Indonesia.",外交部副部长谢锋向美国驻北京大使馆提出严正交涉，谴责美国将其击落，并指责华盛顿逆转了习近平与拜登总统去年11月在印度尼西亚面对面会晤后中美关系出现的改善。
"""China resolutely opposes and strongly protests this, and urges the United States not to take further actions that harm China's interests, and not to escalate or expand the tension,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Mr. Xie said that China reserved the right to respond as necessary.","""中方对此坚决反对、强烈抗议，敦促美方不得采取进一步行动损害中方利益，不得升级、扩大紧张局势，""中国外交部在一份声明中说。谢锋表示，中国保留作出必要反应的权利。"
"Regardless of Beijing's protests, U.S. Navy divers are scouring the waters off the coast of South Carolina to recover the balloon's parts.",尽管中国提出抗议，但美国海军潜水员正在南卡罗来纳州海岸附近的海域里搜寻，打捞气球的部件。
"For China, the ill-timed flight of the craft and its costly discovery over the continental United States suggests a lack of coordination between the country's military and other organs of the government, analysts say.",分析人士说，中国的飞行器在不恰当的时候飞入美国领空，以及在美国大陆上空被发现的重大错误表明中国军方与政府其他部门之间缺乏协调。
"""It shows the national security coordination process to prevent incidents like this are not yet functional in the way that they need to be,"" said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, and a former U.S. defense official.","""这表明防止此类事件发生的国家安全协调机制尚未起到应有的作用，""曾任美国国防部官员的唐安竹(Drew Thompson)说，他现在是新加坡国立大学李光耀公共政策学院的高级客座研究员。"
"There are other theories about how this could have happened. China's sprawling bureaucracy might simply be too big to track the whereabouts of all its high-altitude balloons across the globe, and anticipate when their locations might set off alarm. (After a spate of reports in recent days, China acknowledged on Monday that another Chinese balloon is floating around Latin America, also, according to Beijing, errantly.)",也有其他理论能解释会让这种事发生的原因。中国庞大的官僚机构也许根本无法跟踪它所有的高空气球在全球的踪迹，也无法预料气球的位置什么时候可能会引发警报。(媒体最近几天对中国气球进行了接二连三的报道后，中国周一承认，另一个气球正在拉丁美洲附近飘浮，而且据北京说，也是由于偏离了航线。)
"M. Taylor Fravel, the director of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an expert on China's military, said he thought that China's leadership would not have authorized the balloon's flight to the United States had it been aware of its journey, given Mr. Blinken's visit.",麻省理工学院安全研究项目主任、研究中国军事问题的专家傅泰林(M. Taylor Fravel)说，他认为，考虑到布林肯即将来访，如果中国领导人知道气球航线的话，他们不会批准放飞这个飞往美国的气球。
"""I can only speculate about the intentions of the unit that launched the mission: They may have been unaware or unconcerned about any political fallout should it be discovered, or perhaps they were executing longstanding plans without any attention to the diplomatic calendar,"" Mr. Fravel said in an email.","""我只能猜测执行这项任务的单位的意图:他们可能没有意识到或不关心气球一旦被发现会带来什么样的政治后果，或者他们可能是在执行一个计划已久的项目，没有注意外交日程表上的事情，""傅泰林在电子邮件中写道。"
"Mr. Thompson said it was possible China's military orchestrated the flap, as it would stand to benefit from heightened and sustained tension with the United States. Surveillance balloons are thought to be operated by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, which is also responsible for China's nuclear and conventional missile arsenal. Taiwan's military confirmed last year that Chinese balloons that were spotted floating above the self-governing island were operated by the rocket force, though it said the balloons were likely being used to observe the weather.",傅泰林说，中国军方精心策划该事件也是一种可能，因为军方会从与美国持续加剧的紧张关系中获益。监视气球被认为由中国人民解放军火箭军负责，火箭军也负责中国的核导弹和常规导弹武库。台湾军方去年曾确认，人们看到的在这个自治岛屿附近上空漂浮的中国气球是中国火箭军释放的，但表示它们很可能是在进行气象观测。
"The Chinese military has caught other parts of the government off guard before. In 2011, the People's Liberation Army conducted its first test of its new J-20 stealth fighter just hours ahead of a meeting in Beijing between Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Hu Jintao, the Chinese leader at the time. The test flight was interpreted as a bid to undermine the visit, which was held to improve defense ties. Mr. Hu, who was a decidedly less powerful leader compared to Mr. Xi, appeared unaware of the test when prodded by Mr. Gates.",中国军方以前也曾让政府其他部门措手不及过。2011年，时任美国国防部长的罗伯特·盖茨与当时的中国领导人胡锦涛在北京举行会晤几小时前，解放军对新型歼-20隐形战斗机进行了首次试飞。人们对试飞的解读是中国军方试图破坏那次旨在改善两国防务关系的访问。胡锦涛与习近平相比权力小得多，面对盖茨的提问，胡锦涛似乎对试飞一事并不知情。
"In another incident in 2007, China's foreign ministry declined for days to comment on a successful antisatellite missile test conducted by the rocket force, then known as the Second Artillery Corps. The silence at the time underscored the secrecy of China's military, which only communicated tests of that nature directly to Mr. Hu.",2007年，中国成功进行了一次导弹试验，当时被称为第二炮兵部队的火箭军执行了该试验，成功击落一颗本国卫星。中国外交部曾好几天拒绝对此事发表评论，外交部当时的沉默凸显了中国军方对政府保秘的做法，进行这类试验时，军方只直接通报胡锦涛。
"In all cases, the inability to peer into China's thinking which has been exacerbated by a widening mistrust between Washington and Beijing has only added to the sense of volatility in the relationship.",在所有情况下，无法了解中国怎么想，只会增加人们对中美关系变化无常的感觉，华盛顿和北京之间日益增长的不信任已在加剧这种情况。
"""What the balloon incident totally reinforces is the complete lack of transparency into Chinese decision-making,"" Mr. Thompson said. ""This is a feature, not a bug of their system. And it's going to happen again. If events are fast-moving, the government doesn't have nimble decision-making structures. They can't communicate effectively during a rapidly evolving crisis, which really bodes ill for efforts right now with China.""","""气球事件完全强化了中国决策完全缺乏透明度的问题，""唐安竹说。""这是他们系统的一个特性，而不是一个问题。而且这类事件还会再次发生。如果事态发展迅速，政府就没有灵活的决策机制。他们不能在进展迅速的危机中有效沟通，这对目前与中国处理关系的努力来说，确实是个坏兆头。"""
"After an American fighter jet shot down the Chinese balloon that had floated across the United States, the reaction from Beijing defensive, angered, yet hedging its options illustrated the challenges facing China's leader, Xi Jinping, as he tries to stabilize relations while giving little, if any, ground.",一架美国战斗机击落了飘过美国上空的中国气球后，北京做出了自卫性、愤怒、给自己留有余地的反应，表明了中国领导人习近平面临的挑战。他在努力稳定关系的同时，尽量不做出让步。
"Hours after the balloon was struck by a Sidewinder missile and crumpled into the waters off South Carolina, the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared its ""strong discontent and protest"" and doubled down on its position that the balloon was a civilian research airship blown way off course by fierce winds. Washington, not Beijing, had broken the rules, the ministry said.","气球被一枚""响尾蛇""导弹击中、坠入南卡罗来纳州海域数小时后，中国外交部""表示强烈不满和抗议""，再次强调了中国的说法，即气球是民用研究飞艇，受强烈气流影响偏离了方向。外交部说，违反国际惯例的是华盛顿，而不是北京。"
Biden administration officials have rejected China's explanation and insisted that the balloon was on a spying mission.,拜登政府官员拒绝接受中国的解释，坚称气球是在执行间谍任务。
"""The Chinese side clearly requested that the U.S. appropriately deal with this in a calm, professional and restrained manner,"" said the statement from the Chinese ministry on Sunday. ""For the United States to insist on using armed force is clearly an excessive reaction.""","""中方明确要求美方以冷静、专业、克制方式妥善处理，""中国外交部在周日的声明中说。""美方执意动用武力，明显反应过度。"""
"Chinese officials had been preparing to host the U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, for talks this week in Beijing aimed at containing tensions over a glut of issues: technology barriers and bans, Western opposition to hard-line Chinese policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and American support for Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing has demanded must accept unification. Mr. Blinken pulled out of his trip to China, citing anger over the balloon.",中国官员原本准备本周在北京接待即将来访的美国国务卿布林肯，与他举行会谈，以防止中美之间因一系列问题引发的紧张关系而进一步恶化，这些问题包括技术壁垒和出口禁令、西方国家对中国在香港和新疆的强硬政策的不满，以及美国对台湾的支持，北京一直要求自治的台湾必须接受统一。 布林肯以对气球事件的愤怒为由，取消了他的中国之行。
"Beijing's reaction to the bipartisan furor in the United States over the high-altitude balloon suggested that Chinese leaders were baffled that those planned talks in Beijing had been upstaged by what they described as an innocent mistake. But China also suggested that it could somehow retaliate against the American military's action: The Foreign Ministry noted that it ""retains the right to respond further.""","美国两党人士都对中国高空气球出现在美国上空群情激愤，北京对这种愤怒的反应表明中国领导人不明白为什么原定在北京举行的会谈会被气球搅乱，他们把气球出现在美国上空描述为一个无意间形成的错误。但中国也表示，可能会以某种方式对美军击落气球进行报复。外交部在声明中指出，中国""保留作出进一步必要反应的权利""。"
"Xie Feng, a Chinese vice foreign minister, told an unnamed senior diplomat from the American Embassy in Beijing that the United States had distorted the facts over the balloon and damaged efforts to stabilize relations, the Foreign Ministry said. Mr. Xie said, ""urges the United States not to take steps that further harm Chinese interests, or escalate and expand tensions.""","中国外交部称，外交部副部长谢峰对美国驻华大使馆一名未具名的高级外交官表示，美国歪曲了气球事件的事实，破坏了稳定两国关系的努力。谢峰表示，中国""敦促美方不得采取进一步行动损害中方利益，不得升级、扩大紧张局势""。"
"China's Ministry of National Defense, which speaks for the military, also called the shooting down of the balloon an ""excessive reaction.""","中国国防部也代表军方做出声明，称击落气球是""过度反应""。"
"""We solemnly protest the U.S. action, and retain the right to use the necessary means to deal with similar circumstances,"" the Defense Ministry said in its two-sentence statement.","""我们对美方这一做法表示严正抗议，保留使用必要手段处置类似情况的权利，""国防部在声明中表示。"
Calibrating China's reaction will be tricky for Mr. Xi.,中国如何调整确定反应程度，对习近平来说将是个棘手的问题。
"""China is in a very tight geopolitical spot,"" said Evan S. Medeiros, a professor of international politics at Georgetown University who served as President Barack Obama's top adviser on Asia-Pacific affairs. ""They were caught red handed with no place to go. And during a moment when they want to improve relations with many big powers, principally the U.S.""","""中国的地缘政治处境非常紧张，""乔治城大学国际政治学教授麦艾文(Evan S. Medeiros)说，他曾担任奥巴马总统的亚太事务高级顾问。""他们在大庭广众之下被抓了个现行。而且是在他们想改善与许多大国、主要是美国的关系的时刻。"""
"China's internet often an echo chamber for nationalist emotions resounded with calls for Beijing to stand up to the United States over shooting down of the balloon. And even if Mr. Xi and other Chinese Communist Party leaders can brush off public pressure, their own prickly pride may demand some symbolic countermeasure to save face.",中国的互联网通常是民族主义情绪的回音室，网上回荡着要求北京就击落气球一事与美国对抗的呼声。即使习近平和其他中共领导人能够无视公众压力，他们自己易怒的傲气也会需要某种挽回面子的象征性反制措施。
"But Mr. Xi has his hands full with domestic strains and may want to avoid another round of tit-for-tat antagonism with the Biden administration. China's economy is anemic after the abrupt abandonment of Mr. Xi's strict ""zero Covid"" policies, and the government is also trying to defuse a longer-term real-estate crisis. The United States' tightening restrictions on sales of advanced technology to China, especially cutting-edge semiconductors, could hurt Chinese companies and Mr. Xi's innovation plans.","但习近平已为应对国内压力忙得不可开交，他可能会想避免与拜登政府展开又一轮针锋相对的对抗。习近平突然放弃了新冠""清零""的严厉政策后，中国经济一直缺乏生气，政府也在努力化解为时已久的房地产危机。美国收紧向中国出口先进技术，尤其是尖端半导体的限制，可能给中国企业和习近平的创新计划造成损害。"
"Since beginning a third five-year term as party leader in October, Mr. Xi has tried to ease tensions with Western countries including the United States, Australia and European powers worried that they are coalescing into a firmer alliance committed to containing Chinese power.",去年10月，习近平开始了中共总书记的第三个五年任期，在那之后，他一直在试图缓和与西方国家——包括美国、澳大利亚和欧洲大国——的紧张关系，他担心西方国家正在形成一个致力于遏制中国实力的更牢固的联盟。
"""It would be a very poor strategic move on the part of China to really make a big deal out of this,"" Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, said of the downing of the balloon. ""The more they huff and puff, the more it reduces the credibility of their story that this was a civilian weather balloon blown off course.""","""中国在这件事上小题大做，在战略上将是非常糟糕的一步棋，""斯坦福大学弗里曼·斯波利国际研究所的研究员梅惠琳(Oriana Skylar Mastro)谈到击落气球时说。""他们越是怒气冲冲，就越会降低他们把气球描述为被风吹离了方向的民用飞艇的可信度。"""
"Despite its mention of possible further actions, the Chinese government's response to the balloon's downing also hinted that it does not want to drag out the dispute. Wording choices in the Foreign Ministry statement hinted that Beijing may keep defending its actions, and denying that the balloon was a vehicle for spying, while holding back from reactions that could escalate the dispute.",尽管在声明中提到了可能采取进一步的行动，但中国政府对击落气球的反应也表明它不想让争端持续下去。外交部声明的措辞表明北京可能会继续为自己的行为辩护，否认气球是间谍工具，同时避免做出可能使争端升级的反应。
"Notably, the Chinese statement accused the United States of violating international norms by shooting down the balloon, but did not mention any claimed violation of international law. China also said that it would ""defend the legitimate rights and interests of the enterprise involved"" with the balloon, which could help it make a case that the government was not directly involved in launching the balloon.","值得注意的是，中国在声明中指责美国击落气球违反了国际惯例，但并没有说违反了国际法律。中国还说将""坚决维护有关企业的正当权益""，这会帮助政府为自己没有直接参与放气球的说法进行辩护。"
"The wording ""reflects that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not believe downing the balloon is a clear legal violation,"" Julian Ku, a professor of law at Hofstra University who studies China's role in international law, wrote in emailed answers to questions.","这种措辞""反映出外交部不认为击落气球是明确的违法行为""，霍夫斯特拉大学法学教授古举伦在用电子邮件回答问题时写道，他的研究领域包括中国应用国际法方面的问题。"
"""The ministry will say if something is a violation of international law, so it is significant they did not say so here,"" he said.","""如果某件事违反了国际法，外交部会指出来。所以，他们没有在声明中这样说，很重要，""他说。"
"""Moreover, they need to think about their own rights in case the U.S. starts sending balloons or drones into China,"" Mr. Ku added. ""If they push too hard here, it would undermine a future legal argument they might need to make.""","""此外他们需要考虑，如果美国开始向中国上空派出气球或无人机的话，他们自己有什么权利，""古举伦补充道。""如果他们在这次的反应太过激，就会破坏他们未来可能需要使用的法律依据。"""
"Some in China are calling for a tougher response. After Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House, visited Taiwan last year, many on the Chinese internet said they were angry that the Chinese air force had not as one well-known commentator had said was possible tried to force away her plane. This time, too, some voices on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media site, said that their leaders should get tougher; maybe, one bellicose commenter said, by shooting down an American plane.",有些中国人呼吁做出更强有力的回应。去年，时任美国众议院议长的佩洛西访台后，许多人在中国互联网上说，他们对中国空军没有试图迫使她的飞机像一名知名评论员所说的那样改变航线感到愤怒。这次，中国热门社交媒体网站微博上也有一些声音说，中国领导人应该对美国更强硬;也许像一名好战的评论者说的那样，把美国飞机打下来。
"Chinese leaders have enormous power to channel, or suppress, nationalist rancor, and Mr. Xi in particular has erased the space for spontaneous protests, so there is little chance of such anger pushing them into provocative action. That Mr. Blinken had called Wang Yi, China's top foreign policy official, about canceling his visit to Beijing indicated that both sides wanted to keep communication going, said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University in eastern China.",中国领导人在引导或压制民族主义仇恨上有巨大的权力，尤其是习近平，他已经消除了中国人自发抗议的空间，所以这些愤怒情绪几乎没有将人们推向采取煽动性行动的可能。位于华东地区的南京大学国际关系教授朱峰表示，布林肯就取消访华的决定致电中国最高外交政策官员王毅，这个做法表明，双方都希望继续保持沟通。
"But the fraying ties between Beijing and Washington may come under much heavier stress if Kevin McCarthy, the new House speaker, visits Taiwan. Mr. McCarthy had said earlier that he might visit the island upon taking up his role, seeking to demonstrate Washington's support for Taiwan against threats from China, but he has not announced any firm plans.",但如果新任众议院议长凯文·麦卡锡访问台湾的话，可能会给中美之间的紧张关系带来更大的压力。麦卡锡已在早些时候表示，他可能会在上任后访问台湾，以表明华盛顿支持台湾抵抗来自中国的威胁，但他尚未宣布任何明确计划。
"""China's never going to tell me where I can and can't go,"" Mr. McCarthy told reporters last week. ""But I have nothing scheduled right now.""","""中国绝不能告诉我能去哪里、不能去哪里，""麦卡锡上周对记者说。""但我目前没有任何安排。"""
"Still, even if the balloon crisis dies down quickly, it has shown how low trust has fallen from the thaw that began when ""Ping-Pong diplomacy"" helped pave the way for relations in the early 1970s, said Professor Zhu. Back then, American table tennis players visited China for a series of matches that helped eased decades of animosity.","尽管如此，朱锋说，即使气球危机迅速平息下去的话，这件事也表明了自20世纪70年代初的""乒乓外交""为中美关系铺平道路以来，两国的互信度已降到了什么水平。美国乒乓球运动员曾在20世纪70年代与中国运动员进行了一系列比赛，帮助缓和了几十年的敌意。"
"""Over 50 years ago, the ice-melting of our relations began with Ping-Pong diplomacy,"" Professor Zhu said, echoing a quip that has spread on the Chinese internet. ""It was a small ball that started it, and now our relations are in trouble over a big ball or balloon. I never expected this metaphor could happen.""","""50多年前，中美关系破冰始于乒乓外交，""朱锋说，他用的是中国互联网上一个流传说法。""中美关系从一个小球开始，现在因为一个大球或气球而陷入困境。我从未想到这个隐喻会发生。"""
"When China abruptly abandoned ""zero Covid,"" accelerating an onslaught of infections and deaths, many feared a prolonged tide rippling from cities into villages. Now, two months later, the worst seems to have passed, and the government is eager to shift attention to economic recovery.","中国突然放弃新冠""清零""政策导致感染病例和死亡人数骤增后，许多人曾担心新冠疫情暴发的海啸会从城市蔓延到农村。现在，两个月之后，最糟糕的阶段似乎已经过去，政府正急于将注意力转移到经济复苏上。"
"Doctors who were mobilized across China to treat a rush of Covid patients say in phone interviews that the number of patients they are now seeing has fallen. Towns and villages that had hunkered down under the surge of infections and funerals are stirring to life. Health officials have declared that Covid cases ""already peaked in late December 2022.""","中国各地的医生在接受电话采访时表示，接治的患者人数已在下降——他们曾经被动员起来救治激增的新冠患者。曾被感染人数激增、忙于为逝者办葬礼压得喘不过气来的城镇和村庄现已恢复生气。中国卫生官员宣布，新冠病毒感染人数已""在2022年12月下旬达到高峰""。"
"""Now the pandemic is already being forgotten from people's minds,"" Gao Xiaobin, a doctor on the outskirts of a small city in Anhui Province in eastern China, said by telephone. ""Nobody is wearing masks anywhere. That's all gone.""","""现在疫情……现在人的意识中，这已经把这个疫情已经忘了，""在安徽一座小城的郊区工作的医生高晓斌(音)在电话中说。""到处都没戴口罩的，都没有了。"""
"The true toll of the outbreak is hard to delineate, with infections and deaths shrouded by censorship and poor data collection. Officially, China has reported nearly 79,000 confirmed Covid-related deaths that occurred in hospitals since Dec. 8. But researchers say that is a drastic undercount because it excludes deaths outside hospitals.",很难搞清楚这轮疫情的真实情况，审查制度和糟糕的数据收集给感染和死亡人数蒙上了神秘色彩。据中国的官方数据，去年12月8日至今年1月26日，累计有近7.9万人因新冠病毒感染相关疾病在医院死亡。但研究人员说，这个数据严重偏低，因为它不包括死在医院外的新冠患者。
"The Communist Party hopes to bustle past such questions and focus on reviving China's economy, battered by lockdowns. Restoring growth could help repair the image of its leader, Xi Jinping, bruised after three years of stringent ""zero Covid"" policies which had largely contained the virus but strangled the economy and then their abrupt, messy abandonment in December. His government's standing will now rest heavily on whether it can create jobs, including for a large pool of unemployed youths and graduates.","中共想把这些问题一带而过，从而将注意力集中到重振受到""清零""封控打击的经济上。恢复增长可能有助于修复中国领导人习近平的形象。在严格实行了三年新冠""清零""政策后，他的形象已受到损害，虽然""清零""政策在很大程度上遏制了病毒的传播，但也扼杀了经济。后来，政府突然在去年12月手忙脚乱地放弃了""清零""。现在，中国政府的声望将在很大程度上取决于能否创造就业机会，包括为大量的失业青年和大学毕业生创造就业机会。"
"Mr. Xi struck a positive note even as he has acknowledged that Covid outbreaks remain worrisome. ""The dawn is just ahead,"" he told the country in a speech on Jan. 20, shortly before the Lunar New Year holiday.","今年1月20日，习近平在春节到来前发表讲话时表达了乐观情绪，他告诉全国人民""曙光就在前头""，但也承认新冠疫情仍令人担心。"
"Provincial and city leaders have declared, one after another, that infections have peaked in their areas. Some of China's economic powerhouse regions have issued plans for restoring business confidence. Speaking about economic revitalization last week to hundreds of officials, Huang Kunming, the Communist Party leader of Guangdong Province in southern China, did not mention the pandemic at all.",各省市领导人纷纷宣布，感染高峰已过。对中国经济增长贡献最大的一些地区已经出台了恢复商业信心的计划。上周，广东省委书记黄坤明在向全省数百名官员发表讲话时只提了经济振兴，根本没提新冠疫情。
"The government has sought to shape the public narrative about the outbreak by limiting information and censoring criticism of its response. Still, anger mounted over shortages of basic medicines and the government's obfuscation of the death count from Covid while lines at funeral parlors grew and city morgues overflowed with bodies.",政府试图通过控制信息和审查批评政府应对疫情措施的意见，来塑造公众的疫情叙事。尽管如此，仍有难以压抑的愤怒。人们对这轮疫情暴发期间基本药物短缺，殡仪馆外的队伍越排越长，城市里的太平间堆满尸体，但政府却在新冠感染有关的死亡人数上含糊不清感到非常不满。
"But for many Chinese people, the imperative to move past the pandemic and make a living in a hardscrabble society may, in the end, overshadow their grievances.",但对许多中国人来说，让疫情成为过去、让他们能在一个艰难的社会谋生的紧迫感，也许最终会把这种不满压下去。
"In phone calls to dozens of residents across China, many said they were more worried about finding work, rebuilding businesses and securing a future for their children.",在打给中国各地数十名民众的电话中，许多人表示，他们更担心的是找工作、恢复生意，以及确保子女有更好的未来。
"""People don't even talk about Covid anymore,"" said Zhao Xuqian, 30, who said he lost his last job at a flour factory in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou and returned to his home village in Anhui Province. He was thinking about finding a new job in the coming weeks.","""人们甚至不谈论新冠了，""现年30岁的赵旭谦(音)说，他已多次失业，最近失去了在郑州一家面粉厂的工作后，回到了安徽老家。他正在考虑未来几周找一份新工作。"
"""The new year has started,"" he said. ""We should forget the past and face forward.""","""新年开始了，""他说。""我们应该忘掉过去，向前看。"""
"Even as Chinese medical officials signaled that infections have been falling, they have also warned that the country remains vulnerable to fresh outbreaks, especially in rural areas where medical services are much scarcer than in cities.",尽管中国卫生官员表示感染人数一直在下降，但他们也警告，国内仍存在暴发新一轮疫情的风险，尤其是在医疗服务比城市少得多的农村地区。
"""A new peak in infections could emerge in the areas that lack doctors and medicine, those less than 10 percent nationwide that have not completed the full vaccination round,"" Gao Fu, a former director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told China Newsweek magazine earlier this month. ""I still want to urge everyone to set aside the most important medical resources for the high-risk groups that are aged or have underlying illnesses.""","""新的感染高峰很可能出现在缺医少药，国内剩余不到10%没完成全程疫苗接种的地方，""曾任中国疾病预防控制中心主任的高福本月早些时候接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时说。""因此，还是呼吁大家，将最重要的医疗资源留给有基础疾病的、老年高危人群。"""
"To limit the toll of any new outbreaks this year, China will also have to administer more vaccination jabs and booster shots, especially among the country's older adults, and better equip hospitals to cope with patients who have not yet had Covid, several doctors and epidemiologists said.",有医生和流行病学家表示，为了减少今年新疫情暴发导致的死亡人数，中国必须给更多的人，尤其是中国的老年人接种疫苗、打疫苗加强剂，并让医院有更好的准备，以应对尚未感染新冠人群中的疫情暴发。
"The next wave may not be as massive, but it could concentrate its wrath on the vulnerable places and people that managed to avoid infection in the recent surge.",下一轮疫情的范围可能不会这么大，但它可能集中在那些勉强躲过了这轮疫情的脆弱地区和人群身上。
"Some Chinese health officials estimate that as much as 80 percent of the country's 1.4 billion people were infected in late 2022. (Other experts are skeptical of that estimate, saying that even with the swift transmissibility of the Omicron variant, it is unlikely that it could have infected so many people in such short order.)",一些中国卫生官员估计，截止2022年底，中国的14亿人中已有高达80%的人感染过新冠病毒。(其他专家对这个估计持怀疑态度，他们说，即使是传播速度非常快的奥密克戎变异株，也不太可能在如此短的时间里感染这么多人。)
"""Future death projections will be partially determined by how well China could protect those who are of higher risks but are still hunkering down,"" Xi Chen, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health who has monitored China's Covid pandemic, wrote in emailed answers to questions.","""对未来疫情死亡率的预测将部分取决于中国如何保护那些仍有较高风险，但躲过了这轮疫情的人，""耶鲁大学公共卫生学院副教授陈曦在回答记者问题的电子邮件中写道。"
"Covid outbreaks in China multiplied late last year as the fast-spreading Omicron variant wore down armies of local officials enforcing lockdowns and travel restrictions. The surge grew into a tsunami after Mr. Xi lifted the pandemic restrictions, apparently shaken by protests across the country and the deepening economic slump.","去年年底，快速传播的奥密克戎变异株突破了执行严格封控和旅行限制措施的地方官员大军的防线后，感染病例在中国各地激增。显然是受到了全国各地的抗议活动和经济衰退加剧的震动，习近平放弃了""清零""政策，之后，感染激增演变成了疫情海啸。"
"What surprised some was how quickly Covid jumped to China's countryside. Like many doctors, Wang Guocai expected his village in southern China to be hit with infections some weeks after the Omicron subvariant swept big cities. Instead, the outbreak seemed to arrive in full force mere days after it inundated Guangzhou, the provincial capital nearly 200 miles away, he said.",让一些人感到惊讶的是，新冠病毒蔓延到中国农村的速度如此之快。奥密克戎变异株亚型席卷了大城市后，王国才(音)和许多医生一样，曾预计这轮感染传播到他所在的南方乡下需要几周时间。但他说，300多公里外的省会城市广州被疫情淹没后没过几天，新冠就在村子里全面暴发了。
"At first it was mostly young people who lined up at his rural clinic. Many were migrant workers and businesspeople who had recently returned. Then growing numbers of villagers in their 60s, 70s and 80s crowded the clinic every day, Dr. Wang said in a telephone interview.",最早来他的乡村诊所排队的主要是年轻人。许多是最近从城里回来的农民工和做生意的人。王大夫在接受电话采访时说，后来每天涌入诊所的是越来越多的60多岁、70多岁和80多岁的村民。
"In December, he was seeing dozens of patients each day andhanding out tablets for fevers and coughs, he said, but now he is seeing only several a day. He said he was relieved that his village appeared to have avoided deaths.",他说，去年12月，他平均每天要看几十名病人，给他们开退烧药和止咳药，但现在他每天只看几名病人。他说让他感到欣慰的是，他所在的村子似乎无人死亡。
"""Our village was lucky in that, to date, it hasn't had any fatal cases,"" Dr. Wang said. Other villages nearby were less fortunate, he said, though he said he was unclear about the precise number of deaths. ""They were all patients who had quite serious existing conditions.""","""我们村还幸运，暂时的话还没发生致命病例，""王大夫说。他说，附近的其他村子就没有这么幸运了，但他说，他不清楚那些村子的确切死亡人数。""(死者)都是基础病已经比较重那种病人。"""
"China's official death toll falls far short of initial projections by experts such as Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He had earlier estimated that China's Covid eruption could cause 2 millions deaths.",中国官方的死亡人数远远低于专家们最初的预测，比如哈佛大学陈曾熙公共卫生学院的流行病学副教授比尔·哈内奇曾预测，中国的这轮新冠疫情暴发可能会导致200万人死亡。
"""I don't think we have any insight into what has actually happened, beyond the reasonable assumption that the true numbers are far larger than the official ones,"" Professor Hanage said.","""我认为我们对中国实际发生的情况没有任何了解，除了真实数字远高于官方数字这个合理假设之外，""哈内奇说。"
"Instead, Chinese people have built up a mosaic of impressions and stories about how their hometowns have fared.",不过，中国人对自己家乡发生了什么已形成了各种各样的印象和说法。
"Lu Xiaozhou, a writer from Hubei Province in central China, wrote online that 10 to 20 older residents had died in his home village of several thousand people during the recent Covid wave, and that ""counts as very lucky."" Li Jing, a farmer and former migrant worker from Yulin, a rural area of northwest China, said that even though his own family's older relatives survived the outbreak, other families were not as fortunate.","来自湖北的作家卢晓周在网上写道，在最近这轮新冠疫情中，他老家村子里的几千人中有10到20名老人死亡，""这已经非常幸运了""。老家在中国西北部农村地区榆林的农民李静(音)当过农民工，他说，虽然他家的老年亲戚感染新冠病毒后幸存了下来，但其他家庭却不这么幸运。"
"""There have been a lot of funerals in the county lately, I've seen them,"" he said by telephone. Asked about the future, he said: ""Now I don't feel anything. I just want everything to go back to normal, that's all.""","""最近县里面，过白事的人挺多，""他在电话中说。当被问及未来有什么打算时，他说:""我现在没什么感觉，就想一切恢复正常就行了，没别的。"""
"The resumption of normal life poses the risk of another surge of infections, especially after the one- or two-week-long Lunar New Year break, when many rural migrants who had traveled to their hometowns for family reunions start to return to cities. As people start moving again, so could the virus, and those who have avoided infection up to now may be exposed.",恢复正常生活带来感染病例再次激增的风险，尤其是春节过后，许多返乡与家人团聚的农民工在度过了一周或两周的假期后，已开始返回城市。随着人们再次开始流动，病毒也将开始传播，那些到目前为止尚未感染新冠病毒的人存在感染的可能性。
"In the following months, the protection offered by recent vaccinations or immunity developed from infections will wear off, exposing people to renewed risks from Covid unless they receive more shots. There is also the potential danger of new subvariants, possibly less virulent but more transmissible.",通过最近接种疫苗或感染病毒获得的免疫保护将在接下来的几个月里逐渐消失，让人们再次面临感染风险，除非他们再打疫苗。还有出现新变异亚株的潜在危险，尽管新株的毒性可能更小，但传播可能会更快。
"""My other family members were all infected, but not me,"" Wang Xiaoyan, a resident of Ankang, a city in northwest China, said by telephone.","""我们家其他人都阳过，就是我没阳，""中国西北部城市安康的居民王晓燕(音)在电话中说。"
"She said she had stayed in her own house and kept a distance from relatives returning to their home village in December. She only joined her extended family for Lunar New Year feasts of dumplings, stews and fish after the relatives among them who had Covid had recovered. Now she fretted about what might come next.",她说她一直呆在自己家里，与去年12月返乡的亲戚们保持着距离。直到感染了新冠病毒的亲戚们康复后，她才和亲戚们一起吃了有饺子、炖肉和鱼的年夜饭。现在她担心今后会发生什么。
"""I'm worried worried about getting infected,"" she said. ""I still wear a mask now, though basically nobody else does.""","""我担心，担心阳，""她说。""我现在还带着口罩，别人基本上不带，我还带。"""
"On an autumn afternoon at the Hong Kong Golf Club, hundreds of dogs pugs, Pomeranians, Shiba Inus strolled the verdant grounds with their owners in tow, enjoying rare access to the range that charges new members a $2 million entry fee.",一个秋天的午后，在香港哥尔夫球会，哈巴狗、博美犬、柴犬等数百只狗在主人带领下漫步在青翠的草地上，这种难得的享受通常需要200万美元的入会费。
"But these impeccable greens, in the northern reaches of Hong Kong, have become an unlikely battleground.",但香港北部这片无可挑剔的草地已成为意想不到的战场。
The Hong Kong Golf Club has been fighting a government proposal to carve out less than one-fifth of its 172 acres of land and redevelop it for public housing. The open day for dogs was an effort by the club to rally public support to the club members' cause in a city known for its soaring inequality and acute shortage of affordable homes.,香港哥尔夫球会一直在反对政府提出的改建提议——将其近70公顷土地中的不到五分之一重新开发为公共住房。香港以其日益加剧的不平等和经济适用房严重短缺而闻名，狗狗同乐日是球会做出的一项努力，旨在为球会成员的诉求召集公众支持。
"Hong Kong's government has come under pressure from Beijing to reduce the wealth gap in line with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping's promises of ""common prosperity."" But the land dispute puts on picturesque display the tensions between Hong Kong's attempts to redistribute wealth and the interests of the elite who the government has long relied upon for support. The city's business leaders may be aligned with China's Communist Party rulers, but many are also stubbornly protective of Hong Kong's capitalist wealth.","香港政府受到来自北京的压力，要求其按照中国领导人习近平""共同富裕""的承诺缩小贫富差距。香港政府长期依赖精英的支持，但用地纠纷生动地展示了香港重新分配财富的尝试与精英利益之间的紧张关系。这座城市的商界领袖也许是配合中国共产党统治者的，但许多人也顽固地保护着香港的资本主义财富。"
The club has mobilized members to speak out about the public housing plan. Prominent figures in the city's pro-Beijing political establishment have also criticized the proposal.,球会已动员会员就公屋计划发声。该市亲北京政治机构的知名人士也批评了该提议。
"""I hope nobody calls the golf club rich and powerful or pins that label on it. Because it is a sport facility after all,"" said Regina Ip, a senior adviser to the Hong Kong government and a golf club member herself.","""我希望没有人称这家高尔夫球会有钱有势，或给它贴上这个标签。因为它毕竟是一个体育设施，""香港政府高级顾问叶刘淑仪说，她本人也是球会会员。"
"By contrast, Hong Kong newspapers closely aligned with Beijing eager to push the territory even closer ideologically to China's Communist Party have criticized the club, accusing it of ignoring the needs of working people.",相比之下，与北京一致的香港报纸急于推动香港在意识形态上更接近中国共产党，这些报纸批评了球会，指责它无视劳动人民的需求。
"""If the golf course development plan is thwarted, the public impression of 'business colluding with government officials' will only get worse,"" one of the newspapers, Ta Kung Pao, said in an editorial after an environmental review in August effectively delayed the housing plan.","其中一家报纸《大公报》在8月的一篇社论中说:""如果高球场发展计划受挫，只会加深备受诟病的'官商勾结'印象。""此前一份环保评论报告有效地推迟了住房建设计划。"
It's not just avid golfers who are stirring opposition to the land swap. Some members of Hong Kong's business elite see the city government's plans to claim 32 acres of club land as dangerous government meddling in the economy.,煽动反对土地交换的不仅仅是忠实的高尔夫爱好者。香港一些商界精英认为，市政府征用近13公顷球会用地的计划是政府干预经济的危险行为。
"""A feature of capitalism is a gap between rich and poor,"" said Shih Wing Ching, the owner of Centaline property, the biggest property agency in Hong Kong, who has taken up the golf club's cause, though he does not play himself. ""If you try to erase the feature, say by taking away golf, then it's not capitalism, it's socialism.""","""资本主义的一个特点是贫富差距，""香港最大的房地产中介公司中原地产的老板施永青说，他站在球会这一边，尽管他自己并不打球。""如果你试图抹去这个特征，比如取消高尔夫，那它就不是资本主义，而是社会主义。"""
"As a youth, Mr. Shih, 73, was a zealous leftist student who took part in the 1967 labor protests that turned into anti-government riots and were inspired by Mao's Cultural Revolution, which sought to trample traditional privilege. The chaos and trauma of the Cultural Revolution in mainland China eventually turned Mr. Shih against communism, and he later found success selling real estate.","73岁的施永青年轻时是一名狂热的左派学生，他参加了1967年的劳工抗议活动，该活动受到旨在践踏传统特权的毛泽东""文化大革命""启发，后来演变为反政府骚乱。大陆""文革""造成的混乱和创伤最终使施永青反对共产主义，后来他在房地产销售行业取得了成功。"
"""Deng Xiaoping once said that the horses would keep on racing and the dancers would keep on dancing,"" Mr. Shih said, citing a comment the Chinese leader made ahead of Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 to suggest Hong Kong would not lose its capitalist verve. ""If the horses still race and dancers still dance, then I'd add that the golfers should keep on swinging.""","""邓小平说过，马照跑，舞照跳，""施永青说，他引用了这位中国领导人在1997年香港回归中国之前说过的一句话，暗示香港不会失去其资本主义魅力。""如果马照跑，舞照跳，那么我要加一句，高尔夫应该照打。"""
Both sides in the fight recognize that the small section of the golf club that might be claimed by the government would make barely a dent Hong Kong's housing crisis.,争议双方都认识到，政府有可能收回的这一小部分高尔夫球会用地几乎完全无法缓解香港的住房危机。
"For more than 10 years, Hong Kong has been recognized by some yardsticks as having the world's most unaffordable housing market, particularly when comparing median household income to median housing costs.",十多年来，根据某些标准，香港一直被认为是世界上最难以负担的住房市场，特别是在将家庭收入中位数与住房成本中位数相比较时。
"Even Mr. Xi, China's leader, has weighed in on Hong Kong's housing woes.",就连中国领导人习近平也对香港的住房问题发表了看法。
"""Currently, the biggest aspiration of Hong Kong people is to lead a better life, in which they will have more decent housing,"" Mr. Xi said on the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China in July. He urged the government to carry out reforms and ""break the barriers of vested interests.""","7月，习近平在香港回归中国25周年之际说:""当前，香港最大的民心，就是盼望生活变得更好，盼望房子住得更宽敞一些。""他敦促政府进行改革，""破除利益固化藩篱""。"
"Some pro-establishment politicians have argued that by targeting the golf club, the government is sowing greater hostility between rich and the poor.",一些建制派政界人士称，通过针对高尔夫球会，政府在富人和穷人之间播下了更大的敌意。
"Lau Chi-pang, a legislator on the influential elections committee, was criticized by Chinese state media for appearing in the golf club's YouTube video stream praising the club. Mr. Lau, a history professor who was commissioned by the club to write a book about it, said it had ""rich cultural value.""","有影响力的选举委员会立法委员刘志鹏在高尔夫球会部的YouTube视频中赞扬了该球会，他因此受到中国官方媒体的批评。刘志鹏是一名历史教授，受球会委托写了一本关于它的书，并说球会具有""丰富的文化价值""。"
"""If public housing is built on the golf course, it will become a political monument,"" he said, adding that if housing advocates win the battle they will ""then aim at other private clubs.""","他说:""如果公共住房建在高尔夫球场上，它将成为一座政治纪念碑。""他还说，如果住房倡导者赢得这场战斗，他们将""以其他私人俱乐部为目标""。"
"The dispute over the course began in 2018, when Hong Kong's government solicited public input on where to acquire land for public housing, and a few pro-democracy legislators raised the idea of taking back land from the golf club. The land is owned by the government, which has leased it to the club since 1911.",关于球场的争议始于2018年，当时香港政府就公屋征地地点征求公众意见，一些亲民主的立法会议员提出了从高尔夫球会收回土地的想法。这块土地归政府所有，自1911年起就租给了球会。
"Polls showed that 60 percent of the public supported the plan. But with the business sector strongly opposing the proposal, the government decided to develop only 32 out of the club's 172 acres.",民意调查显示，60%的公众支持该计划。但由于商界强烈反对该提议，政府决定仅征用开发球会近70公顷土地中的约13公顷。
"Mr. Lau argued that there is other land available for development, especially along the northern area bordering Shenzhen in mainland China, which is more important to Beijing than a few buildings on a golf course.",刘志鹏认为，还有其他土地可供开发，尤其是在北部——中国大陆与深圳接壤的地区，这对北京来说比高尔夫球场上的几栋楼更重要。
"Late last year, the city received over 6,000 letters from golf club members and others opposing the plan. Their arguments ranged from one-sentence declarations ""I want to play golf!"" to a 500-page long petition listing the golf course's historic value and the significance of the Hong Kong Open, a prominent international tournament long held at the club.","去年年底，该市收到了6000多封来自球会成员和该计划的其他反对人士的来信。他们的论点短至一句话声明——""我想打高尔夫球!""——长至一份500页的请愿书，列出了高尔夫球场的历史价值和香港公开赛的意义，香港公开赛是一项长期在该球会举办的重要国际赛事。"
"The dispute has become tied up with the combustible mix of Hong Kong's crackdown, as opponents of the land swap even those aligned with Beijing test the limits of free expression. Some pro-Beijing district councilors have objected to the housing plan, warning of traffic jams and a lack of infrastructure to support the influx of new residents. One councilor even openly declared in a meeting that opponents of the plan would ""rise and attack"" should it go forward, a bold statement in Hong Kong with a national security law curtailing political dissent.","随着反对换地的人士——甚至包括亲北京人士——考验言论自由的极限，这场争端已同香港敏感的打压行动捆绑到了一起。一些亲北京的区议员反对这项建屋计划，他们警告，这会造成交通堵塞，而且基础设施不足以满足涌入的新居民。有议员甚至在一次会议上公开宣称，如果该计划得以实施，反对者将""起而攻之""。在香港，这是一个大胆的表态，因为香港的国家安全法限制政治异议。"
Further complicating matters is that several former legislators who proposed using the golf course land for housing have either been arrested on national security charges or gone into self-imposed exile.,让事情变得更为复杂的是，提议将高尔夫球场用地用作住宅的几名前立法会议员，要么因涉嫌国家安全指控而被捕，要么躲去了国外。
Grassroots organizations pushing for more public housing have voiced increasing frustration over the delays.,推动建设更多公房的草根组织对拖延越来越不满。
"""If the government walks back from the decision, there will be little authority in the future,"" said Man Yu-ming, the chairman of the pro-establishment Federation of Public Housing Estates. ""We're not giving up any land we deserve!""","""如果政府撤销决定，未来就没有什么权威了，""建制派的公屋联会主席文裕明说。""我们不会放弃任何我们应得的土地!"""
"John Lee, the city's top leader, who was appointed in July, recently said he respected the housing plan, which was conceived of during his predecessor's administration.",去年7月上任的香港最高行政长官李家超最近表示，他尊重前任政府时期提出的住房计划。
"The delays are a sharp contrast to how Hong Kong's neighbor across the border in mainland China, Shenzhen, has handled its land shortage. That city, an economic hub of more than 17 million people, tapped several golf courses for urban development in recent years. Some deem the Shenzhen government decisive and resolute. Others don't.",这种拖延与香港相邻的内地城市深圳处理土地短缺的方式形成了鲜明对比。作为拥有1700多万人口的经济中心，近年来为了城市发展，深圳修建了几座高尔夫球场。有人认为深圳政府干脆果断。也有人并不这么看。
"""A debate about this reflects the healthy society of Hong Kong,"" said Ronny Tong, an adviser to the government. ""Ultimately, it's an issue of two competing values.""","""在这件事情上的分歧反映出香港社会的健康，""政府顾问汤家骅说。""归根结底，这是两种相互竞争的价值观的问题。"""
"Mr. Tong, a golf club member, has argued that golf courses attract professionals and investors to Hong Kong.",身为一家高尔夫俱乐部成员的汤家骅认为，高尔夫球场可以吸引专业人士和投资者来香港。
"""I play golf all the time,"" Mr. Tong said. ""It's not a sin.""","""我一直在打高尔夫球，""汤家骅说。""这不是罪恶。"""
"To Tang Chao, the apartment in northeast China was where he and his wife were going to start a new life together.",对唐超(音)来说，中国东北的那处公寓是他和妻子开始新生活的地方。
"They put down tens of thousands of dollars for it. But months past its scheduled completion, a concrete shell with wiring protruding from the walls and piles of dirt on the floor was all there was to show for the expense. Soon, even their marriage unraveled.",他们为此投入了几百万。但在原定完工日期的几个月后，他们的钱只换来露着电线的混凝土毛坯，地上堆满废料。很快，就连他们的婚姻也破裂了。
"In another city, a man bought a space for a grocery business he thought would help give his young son a better future. A woman paid for an apartment where she imagined her toddler would grow up safe, and she might have a second child. In Shanghai, a technician from a small town thought she had made her parents proud by buying a new home in the big city.",在另一个城市，一个男人为开杂货店买下一个空间，他想给年幼的儿子更美好的未来。一个女人买了一套公寓，想象她蹒跚学步的孩子在那里安全地长大，而且她可能会生第二个孩子。在上海，一位来自小城市的技术人员认为，她在大城市买了新房，让父母感到骄傲。
What these and hundreds of thousands of other Chinese homebuyers couldn't have known was that the country's decades-long real estate boom would come to a sudden halt. Developers ran out of money amid a government crackdown on excessive debt and a slowing economy. They stopped building.,这些人和其他数十万中国购房者想不到的是，该国长达数十年的房地产繁荣会突然停止。在政府打击过度债务和经济放缓的情况下，开发商耗尽资金，停止了建造。
"Across the country, instead of apartment towers, uninhabitable concrete structures rise up from idle, overgrown construction sites. Infuriated homebuyers in more than 100 cities rose up in a rare act of collective rebellion last year, vowing not to repay loans on unfinished properties.",在全国各地，闲置的建筑工地杂草丛生，上面耸立着的不是公寓楼，而是无法居住的混凝土结构。去年在100多个城市，被激怒的购房者罕见地集体反抗，誓言停止偿还未完工房产的贷款。
We talked to four people who emptied their life savings and took out huge loans for homes that have not been completed. They told us about their frustration and showed us the apartments that are now ugly reminders of dreams dashed and promises broken.,我们采访了四位购房者，他们掏空毕生积蓄，以巨额贷款买房，房子却尚未完工。他们向我们诉说挫败感，并给我们看了公寓，它们千疮百孔，提醒着他们破灭的梦想和未兑现的承诺。
"""It was a simple dream to have a home, a family,"" Mr. Tang said.","""只是一个简单的梦想——拥有一座房子，一个家，""唐超说。"
"""We never imagined homes would go unfinished in Shanghai. How would it be possible?""","""对烂尾都没想过，上海怎么可能会烂尾呢?"""
"Daisy Xu, a 28-year-old lab technician, remembers the day she bought her apartment in Shanghai as if it were yesterday.",28岁的实验室技术员黛西·徐(音)对她在上海买房的那天记忆犹新，仿佛就在昨天。
"She had waited anxiously with hundreds of other prospective buyers in a hotel ballroom at a sales event for Royals Garden, a new development. When her turn finally came, she was given less than a minute to pick an apartment.",在新开发项目君御公馆的一次销售活动中，她和其他数以百计名潜在买家在酒店宴会厅里焦急地等待着。终于轮到她时，她只有不到一分钟的时间来挑选公寓。
"She scanned a wall on which were pinned strips of paper bearing the unit numbers of apartments that had not yet been sold. She knew she didn't want the penthouse or anything lower than the fourth floor. She selected an apartment on the eighth floor, and told a sales employee. He tore the strip off the wall and handed it to her.",她扫视着一面墙上钉着的纸条，上面写着尚未售出的公寓的单元号。她不想要顶层或四楼以下的房子，于是选了一套八楼的公寓，并告诉了销售人员。他从墙上撕下纸条递给她。
"""Congratulations, new homeowner!"" a presenter announced.","""恭喜业主!""一位主持人宣布。"
"Ms. Xu was exhilarated. The apartments sold out that day, dashing the hopes of many others who had been behind her in line.",徐女士兴奋不已。公寓当天售罄，排在她后面的许多人希望都落空了。
"""I was so thrilled and happy, I immediately took a photo of the unit number and told people back home of the good news,"" Ms. Xu said.","""房牌号拿到很激动，感觉很开心，马上拍照给家里报喜，""徐女士说。"
"The apartment cost around $495,000, a hefty price tag but affordable compared to older homes in Shanghai. She wanted a place with two bathrooms, giving her parents or in-laws more privacy if they visited them. The property looked out on a river and was steps away from a bustling street full of restaurants.",这套公寓的价格约为335万人民币，虽然价格不菲，但与上海的老房子相比，还是可以承受的。她希望有两个卫生间，如果父母或公公婆婆来访，可以拥有更多隐私。公寓楼俯瞰河流，距离餐馆林立的繁华街道仅几步之遥。
Ms. Xu was supposed to get the keys in September and move in early this year. But the complex is nowhere close to being done. The unpainted 16-story building is wrapped in green netting and surrounded by weeds and debris. It pains her to see the site on her way to work from an apartment she rents nearby.,徐女士本应在9月拿到钥匙，并在今年年初入住。但是楼房还远未完工。未粉刷过的16层楼被绿网包裹，杂草杂物环绕。她在附近租房住，在上班路上看到这个工地让她很痛苦。
"In China, about 90 percent of new homes are sold before they are built. This presale model allows developers to raise cash quickly, but shifts much of the risk to buyers like Ms. Xu. They are expected to pay in full before construction starts, often taking out mortgages to do so.",在中国，大约90%的新房在建造前就已售出。这种预售模式让开发商能够快速筹集资金，但将大部分风险转移给了徐女士这样的买家。他们需要在开工前全额付款，通常需要贷款。
"Regulations require that the money from presales only be used for construction of that project. But until recently, supervision was lax and developers would use the funds for whatever they wanted, including starting other projects.",法规要求预售资金只能用于该项目的建设。但直到不久前，监管还很松懈，开发商会随心所欲地使用这些资金，包括用于启动其他项目。
"As home prices soared, the government tightened financing rules for developers in the hope of preventing a housing sector collapse. Many large developers like China Fortune Land Development of the Royals Garden project in Shanghai buckled under the weight of massive debt and had to stop work.",随着房价飙升，政府收紧了开发商的融资规则，希望防止房地产行业崩溃。许多大型开发商——比如开发君御公馆的上海华夏幸福——在巨额债务的重压下摇摇欲坠，不得不停工。
"Despite the delay, Ms. Xu continues to fork out more than $1,300 every month in mortgage payments.",尽管交房延误，徐女士每月仍要支付超过8800元人民币的贷款。
She said that she was hiding the problem from her parents. She is from a small town in southern China and owning property in Shanghai had been the ultimate proof that she had made it.,她说她向父母隐瞒了这个问题。她来自中国南方的一个小镇，在上海拥有房产是她成功的最终证明。
"""I dodge their questions about the apartment, but how much longer can I keep doing that?""","""(我对他们)搪塞过去，但是具体能瞒到啥时候呢?"""
"""I wanted a stable family for my newborn baby. ""","""我想孩子刚出世就是想要一个稳定的家庭 。"""
"In the eastern city of Nanchang, a street divides ""Xinli City,"" a development with more than 4,000 apartments, into two sections.

"Andie Cao, a sales representative in her 20s, owns an apartment on the wrong side. Whenever she looks at the finished buildings, she sees the life she was once promised.",20多岁的销售代表安迪·曹(音)的这套公寓就在错误的这一侧。每当她看着完工的建筑，就仿佛看到曾经有人向她承诺过的生活。
"Ms. Cao bought the three-bedroom apartment in 2019 for $203,000. The price was high, but she and her husband had just had a baby and were thinking of having another. They liked that the developer's plan for the large apartment complex included a kindergarten and an elementary school.",曹女士在2019年以137万元人民币的价格购买了这套三居室公寓。价格虽高，但她和丈夫刚刚生了一个孩子，正考虑再要一个。他们喜欢开发商对这个大型公寓区的规划，其中包括一所幼儿园和一所小学。
"Her apartment had been scheduled for completion in November 2021, just in time for her child to start kindergarten. But the developer, Sinic Holdings Group, stopped work in August 2021 when it hit financial trouble, and has yet to finish building the apartments.",她的公寓原定于2021年11月完工，正好赶上她的孩子上幼儿园。但开发商新力控股集团因陷入财务困境，于2021年8月停工，公寓至今仍未完工。
"Ms. Cao had already handed over more than $80,000 for the apartment, money she had saved from toiling away in Shanghai. Then in July of last year, she joined other homebuyers around the country in a mortgage payment strike over unfinished homes.",安迪·曹已为这套房支付55万元的款项，那是她在上海辛苦工作攒下的钱。然后在去年7月，她加入其他全国各地其他购房者的活动，停止偿还未完工房产的贷款。
"""I will not pay until they deliver, and I'm willing to pay a fine by then, but we will not be exploited and bled dry.""","""他不交房我就不付款，我愿意交房之后可以付违约金。我们不想被当成韭菜一直割，敲骨榨髓。"""
"The homebuyers' campaign has drawn the attention of the authorities. The police call her from time to time, warning her not to take any drastic action. Some homebuyers who protested had been detained.",业主发起的运动引起了当局的注意。警察时不时给她打电话，警告她不要采取过激行为。一些抗议的购房者已被拘留。
"""What did we do wrong to deserve being treated like this?"" she said. ""I just don't understand.""","""我们做错了什么?为什么要受到这个待遇，想不通，""她说。"
Ms. Cao and her husband continue to work and pay rent in Shanghai. She doesn't think the apartment will be completed and can't imagine trying to buy another home or having a second child.,安迪·曹与丈夫继续在上海工作租房。她认为那栋房子会烂尾，再买一套房或是生二胎已经不可想象。

"When Tang Chao and his fiancee set out to buy a home in 2019, they were drawn to Haiyi Changzhou, one of the hottest projects in the northeastern city of Dalian.

"The couple bought a modest two-bedroom apartment for around $177,000. To cover the required down payment of $74,000, they used their savings and got their parents to pitch in. Mr. Tang, who works in a restaurant, sold a small place he had out in the countryside.",二人以120万元的价格购置了一套面积不大的两居公寓。为了支付50多万元的首付，他们动用了积蓄，还得请父母资助。在餐馆工作的唐超卖掉了自己在乡下的一套小房子。
"They signed a contract for the apartment in 2019, then got their marriage license. The plan was to hold a wedding after the apartment was completed and move in together.",他们在2019年签订购房合同，然后领了结婚证。他们本计划在交房后举行婚礼，然后乔迁新居。
"""At the time, we told our friends around us that we had bought a home here, we were very proud,"" said Mr. Tang, who spoke on condition that he be identified by his nickname, Chao, because of the political sensitivity of the topic.

Xu Feng remembered 2019 as a good year. The grocery store in the eastern city of Nanchang that he rented and operated with his wife was doing well. He thought it was time to own his own store.,徐峰(音)觉得2019年是个好年头。他和妻子在东部城市南昌租下的一间杂货店生意很好。他觉得是时候购置属于自己的商铺了。
"He found the perfect spot: a 1,000-square feet, $163,000 space on the first floor of a residential tower. It was part of Xinli City, the same giant complex of thousands of apartments where Andie Cao, the service worker, had also bought a unit.",他找到了完美的地点:一处面积约93平，售价110万元的住宅一楼空间。它属于新力城，一座拥有数以千计公寓的大型楼盘，服务从业者安迪·曹也在这里买了一套房。
"Mr. Xu had to sell some goods at a loss to come up with the down payment of about $81,000 and take out a 10-year mortgage. He enrolled his son in an elementary school in Nanchang.",为了支付55万元首付，徐峰不得不亏本甩卖一些商品，并申请了10年按揭贷款。他让儿子上了南昌的一所小学。
"Three years later, Xinli City is still unfinished. Mr. Xu said that he was under immense financial stress, paying for rent on their current business on top of repaying his mortgage. He stopped eating out with friends and cut back on spending except for tuition for his son.",三年后，新力城仍未完工。徐峰说，他承受了巨大的经济压力，除了还贷，还得为手上的生意支付铺租。他不再和朋友出去吃饭，除了儿子的学费，其他开支一律削减。
"""I never thought this would happen to me,"" he said. ""I'm afraid to have another child. The income and expenses barely break even.""","""从来没想过这种事情发生在我身上 ，""他说。""想要二胎也不敢，赚的钱勉强够开支 。"""
"Frustrated by the delay, Mr. Xu and hundreds of homebuyers have protested several times over the past year.",出于对交房延迟的不满，徐峰和数百名购房者在过去一年多次提出抗议。
"They gathered outside the local government, on public squares and even hung banners from the top of a building. But so far, nothing has worked and many people have been detained at protests, he said.",他们在当地政府大门外和公共广场上聚集，甚至在建筑物顶部悬挂横幅。但他说，到目前为止没有任何效果，许多人还在抗议中被拘留。
"In August, Mr. Xu stopped paying his mortgage. This has affected his credit standing and forced him to rely on relatives to take out loans to keep his business afloat. But he said he no longer holds any hope that the government would intervene and help people like him.",徐峰在8月停贷。这影响了他的征信，迫使他依靠亲戚贷款来维持生意。但他表示，已经不再期待政府会出手帮助像他这样的人。

"The longer it has gone on, the more curiosity about China's big spending and lending has given way to concern and a simmering anger that comes from asking questions never answered. Workers at the stadium including many who commute from where Mr. Kosemu lives complain about unfulfilled promises on pay. Residents fret that the prime minister and Chinese officials are undermining democracy, as politicians who resisted China's plans, or just asked tough questions, have reported that their rivals are suddenly flush with money and pro-China messages that the public is expected to simply accept.",这样的情况持续越久，对中国巨额支出和贷款的好奇心越来越变成担忧，人们提出质疑却从未得到回答，这导致愤怒发酵。体育场的建设者抱怨工资承诺没有兑现，他们当中的许多人住在科塞姆家附近，通勤前往工地上班。民众担心，总理和中国官员正在破坏民主，因为抵制中国计划甚至只是提出尖锐问题的政客说，他们的竞争对手突然财路亨通，并发出期待民众言听计从的亲华宣传。
"""There's no proper consultation with the people,"" Mr. Kosemu said. ""No one is happy about it.""","""没有与人民进行适当沟通，""科塞姆说。""人们都很不满意。"""
"For years, Beijing has thrown its wealth across the globe to fuel its economy, gain geopolitical influence and blunt criticism.

"For many islanders, China is productive, yes, and attentive, but they see it less as a benign partner than as an imperious and corrupting force that raises the risk of conflict.",对于许多岛民来说，中国很高效，是的，而且很上心，但他们认为中国与其说是一个良性伙伴，不如说是一股专横和腐败的力量，会增加冲突的风险。
Anti-government riots led to the torching of Chinese businesses in November 2021. Among the protesters' main concerns was the way that China's influence seemed to tilt economic opportunity to politicians and places that were more willing to do Beijing's bidding.,2021年11月，反政府骚乱导致中国企业被纵火焚烧。抗议者的主要担忧之一是，中国的影响力似乎将经济机会向更愿意听从北京吩咐的政客和地方倾斜。
"The government has shown no sign of changing course. In September, the Solomons delayed its 2023 national election, declaring it lacked the capacity to host in the same year both a vote and the Pacific Games, which will take place at the new stadium. As it has embraced Chinese technological infrastructure, the government has also taken on debt that the World Bank recently described as unsustainable.",政府没有表现出改变路线的迹象。去年9月，所罗门群岛推迟了2023年的全国大选，宣布没有能力在同一年举办投票和太平洋运动会，后者将在新体育场举行。在接受中国的技术基础设施同时，该国政府也欠下了世界银行最近称之为不可持续的债务。
"Some American officials worry that China's goal in the Solomons is to create a client state, securing deepwater ports and satellite communication sites. The country's prime minister signed a security deal in April that gives China a right to send police officers or naval vessels to the country with few limitations.",一些美国官员担心，中国在所罗门群岛的目标是建立一个附庸国，获取深水港和卫星通信站点。该国总理于4月签署了一项安全协议，赋予中国派遣警察或海军舰艇到该国的权利，而且几乎不带任何限制。
"As Beijing's priorities have shifted from development to defense, fears of its strong-arm tactics are increasing. Surveys show negative views of China are soaring worldwide.",随着北京的优先事项从发展转向国防，人们对它使用强硬手段的担忧也在增加。调查显示，全球对中国的负面看法正在飙升。
"""China is much less successful than is commonly assumed,"" said Audrye Wong, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. ""They think paying off people is a quicker and more efficient way of achieving the things the Chinese government wants. The reality is it often creates a backlash and doesn't work.""","""中国远没有人们普遍认为的那么成功，""南加州大学政治学家奥黛丽·王说。""他们认为用钱收买是实现中国政府愿望的一种更快、更有效的方式。而现实情况是，这样做经常会引起强烈反对，而且行不通。"""
'They Don't Understand Us',"""他们不明白我们"""
"Every evening just before 6 p.m., workers stream out of the stadium complex in the capital, Honiara, that is being built by a Chinese state-owned company with what officials have described as a generous $50 million grant from the Chinese government.",每天晚上6点之前，工人们从首都霍尼亚拉的体育场馆鱼贯而出，这座场馆由一家中国国有公司建造，官员们称中国政府为此提供了5000万美元的慷慨资助。
"Signs out front boast of friendship, cooperation and safety in Chinese and English. But after work recently, at a food stand across the street, employees called all of that a lie.",场馆前面的标识上用中英文鼓吹友谊、合作和安全。但不久前，在街对面的一个食品摊，下班后的员工们称这一切都是谎言。
"""Everyone wants to strike because of the poor payment and lack of safety,"" said Lenny Olea, 35, a driver. ""We need to get this fixed.""","""大家都想罢工，因为工资低，而且不安全，""35岁的司机伦尼·奥莱亚说。""我们需要解决这个问题。"""
"Mr. Olea said he was making $1.20 an hour less than what he used to make at a hotel, after promises of extra money for food and transportation never materialized. A dozen others said that they had received no safety training, and that their Chinese foremen communicated with hand gestures and hit them in the head if they got something wrong.",奥莱亚说，他的每小时收入比他过去在酒店的收入少了1.20美元，并且承诺的食物和交通补贴从未兑现。还有十几个人说他们没有接受过安全培训，中国工头用手势跟他们交流，如果他们做错了什么，就敲他们的头。
"""They don't understand us,"" Mr. Olea said.","""他们不明白我们，""奥莱亚说。"
"The Chinese Embassy denied a request by The New York Times to speak with the ambassador. The Chinese company, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, did not respond to emailed questions about the workers' complaints.",中国大使馆拒绝了《纽约时报》采访大使的请求。中国土木工程集团没有回复通过电子邮件发送的有关工人投诉的问题。
"Since the government of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare switched allegiance from Taiwan in 2019, saying it would aid the country's development, more Chinese companies have set up in the Solomons. Islanders tell stories of warm interactions with Chinese merchants who migrated decades ago. But many complain that newer arrivals treat workers (and customers) like peons owners often ring up sales from a platform that lets them tower over all who enter.",2019年，总理梅纳西·索加瓦雷的政府与台湾断交，并表示此举将有助于该国的发展，从那以后，越来越多的中国企业在所罗门群岛落户。岛民讲述了与几十年前移民的中国商人热情接触的故事。但许多人抱怨说，新来的中国人对待员工(和顾客)就像对待苦力一样——老板们往往是站在一个台子上收银，俯视所有进来的人。
Some provincial leaders have resisted Chinese investment.,一些省级领导曾抵制中方投资。
"The premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, explained that he had welcomed projects from Japan and other countries but blocked attempts by China to do infrastructure work because he had not seen it add value elsewhere in the country. He said Chinese officials had worked with politicians in Parliament seeking to undermine him, funneling aid to their districts, rather than asking him about what the province needed.",马莱塔省省长丹尼尔·苏伊达尼解释说，他欢迎来自日本和其他国家的项目，但阻止了中国进行基础设施建设的尝试，因为在全国其他地方，他看不到此举带来的好处。他说，中国官员试图削弱他的影响力，与议会中的政客合作，向他们的选区提供援助，而不是询问他该省到底需要什么。
"""So far, the truth is no one has come,"" he said.","""到目前为止，事实就是没有人来过，""他说。"
That lack of consultation remains a source of frustration across the country.,缺乏协商仍是让全国上下感到不满的一个原因。
The Solomons' Indigenous roots include an abiding respect for dialogue. A broad conversation with the community is often required before major decisions are made.,始终尊重对话的作用是所罗门群岛的原住民传统之一。在做出重大决定前，通常需要与社群进行广泛对话。
"China has operated with a more top-down approach. ""What we have seen with the presence of China are pushy advisers,"" said Celsius Talifilu, who worked for Mr. Sogavare until late 2019 and now works for Mr. Suidani.","中国采取的方式更多是自上而下的。""中国在这里让我们看到的更多是咄咄逼人的顾问，""塞尔西乌斯·塔利菲卢说，他曾为索加瓦雷工作到2019年底，现为苏伊达尼工作。"
"In places like Burns Creek, where around 10,000 people many from Malaita have built homes in a grassy flood plain, the lack of transparency has fueled a slow gas leak of resentment.",在伯恩斯克里克这样的地方，约有1万人口——许多来自马莱塔省——在长满青草的洪积平原上安家，透明度的缺乏已经导致怨恨的缓慢蔓延。
"""People stay quiet in this country until it reaches a climax they can't accept,"" said Joe Kelesi, 39, an elder at the Bethlehem Worship Center. ""Until something sparks their disappointment.""","""在这个国家，人们会保持沉默，直到他们忍无可忍，""39岁的伯利恒礼拜中心长老乔·凯莱西说。""直到一些事情引爆他们的失望。"""
'This Is State Capture',"""这就是国家俘获(State Capture)"""
"Outside the Chinese Embassy, posters show splashy renderings of future projects and photos of Mr. Sogavare with Chinese officials. It has the feel of a movie theater marquee, with Mr. Sogavare as the star.",中国大使馆外张贴的宣传海报展示了未来项目的炫目效果图，还有索加瓦雷与中国官员的合影，给人留下一种影院海报的感觉，而索加瓦雷就是大明星。
"Volatile and charming, he has grown more defensive as he has become more intertwined with Chinese projects. He has told reporters there will be no Chinese military bases in the country, but after watching Chinese police train with Solomon Islands officers for the first time, he declared: ""I feel safer.""","他反复无常又魅力四射，随着与中国项目的瓜葛越来越深，他的戒备心也越来越重。他告诉记者，中国不会在这里设军事基地，但在第一次观看中国警察与所罗门警官一起训练后，他宣称:""我更有安全感了。"""
"Leaked documents point to how the security agreement may have come together. Meeting minutes from the Sogavare government showed that, in August 2021, money from the Chinese government went to 39 of 50 members of Parliament from a ""national development fund"" previously financed by Taiwan about $25,000 each.","泄露的文件显示了安全协议可能是如何达成的。索加瓦雷政府的会议纪要显示，2021年8月，中国政府的资金通过之前由台湾资助的""国家发展基金""流向了50名议员中的39人，每人获得约2.5万美元。"
"A signed letter from Mr. Sogavare, 67, explained that the money had come from the Chinese Embassy.",67岁的索加瓦雷在一封署名信中解释说，这笔钱来自中国大使馆。
"Internal memos seen by The Times also identify another set of slightly larger Chinese payments that followed the unrest in November 2021, directed to those who had voted to keep Mr. Sogavare from losing a no-confidence vote.",时报看到的内部备忘录还确认了中国支付的另一笔金额略大的款项，那是在2021年11月的骚乱之后，这笔钱流向了那些在不信任投票中支持索加瓦雷的人。
"Three months later, a draft of the security deal emerged.",三个月后，安全协议草案问世。
"In August, Mr. Sogavare also announced that a Chinese state-owned company, China Harbor Engineering Company, would build 161 cellular towers from Huawei, another Chinese company, with a $70 million loan from the Chinese government.",8月，索加瓦雷还宣布让中国港湾工程有限责任公司这家中国国企负责建设161座华为——另一家中国企业——信号塔，中国政府将提供7000万美元的贷款。
"China Harbor's offices are in the same green building as the Solomons' Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Neither responded to requests for comment, nor did Mr. Sogavare's office.",中国港湾公司的办事处与所罗门群岛外交部位于同一栋绿色建筑内。双方均未回应置评请求，索加瓦雷办公室也未做出回应。
"Opposition leaders accuse China of encouraging the election delay and mounting what they say has been a bribery campaign to keep allies in power. According to civil society groups, Chinese money has been used to buy laptops for Chinese propaganda videos displayed at community gatherings.",反对党领导人批评中国鼓动推迟选举，并开展他们所说的贿赂活动，以此保证其盟友继续掌权。据民间社会团体称，中国的资金被用于购置笔记本电脑，在社区集会上播放中国的政治宣传视频。
"Peter Kenilorea Jr., the deputy opposition leader, said that two government officials had recently offered nearly $2 million to one of his father's cousins to run against him; a little over a year ago, he added, another relative had been asked to run for about $750,000.",反对党副领袖小彼得·凯尼洛雷亚说，两名政府官员最近向他父亲的一名堂表亲送去近200万美元的贿赂，让对方成为自己的竞选对手;他还说在一年多以前，另一名亲戚被要求参选，回报是75万美元。
The dollar amounts were far above what he believed would be possible without Chinese cash.,他认为，如果没有中国的资金，金额不可能大到这种地步。
"And China continues to spend and give. A few months ago, the Chinese ambassador gave a new pickup truck with ""China Aid"" painted on the side to a small hospital's psychiatric unit.","中国的支出和赠予依然源源不断。几个月前，中国大使向一家小医院的精神科赠送了一辆新皮卡，车身上喷涂了""中国援助""的字样。"
"Matthew Wale, the opposition leader, said: ""This is state capture, happening in real life.""","反对党领袖马修·威尔表示:""这就是发生在现实生活中的国家俘获。"""
The United States and Australia have tried to counter Chinese influence. Australia will give more than $100 million in aid to the Solomon Islands this fiscal year. American military doctors also recently performed free surgeries alongside local doctors on an American hospital ship in Honiara's harbor.,美国与澳大利亚已经在试图对抗中国的影响力。澳大利亚将在本财政年度向所罗门群岛提供超过1亿美元的援助。最近，在霍尼亚拉港的美军医疗舰上，美国军医与当地医生一起免费为病患做手术。
"""China never does this kind of thing,"" said Dr. Catherine Tirri, 40, as she observed a fistula surgery. ""China doesn't do service.""","""中国从来没做过这种事，""40岁医生凯瑟琳·蒂里在观察一场瘘管手术时表示。""中国不提供服务。"""
"A more skeptical question followed: Would there be any American follow-up? A plan to reopen a long-closed embassy has been caught up in red tape, limiting the U.S. presence to three diplomats (and a dog) living and working out of hotel rooms, with an interim embassy scheduled to open later this year.",随之而来的是一个更值得怀疑的问题:美国是否会采取后续行动?大使馆关闭已久，其重开计划受到了繁文缛节的阻碍，导致美国的三名外交官(外加一只狗)只能在酒店工作，临时大使馆计划于今年晚些时候开放。
"In the meantime, Mr. Kosemu, the tribal chief, said frustration with China and its proxies keeps intensifying.",科塞姆酋长说，与此同时，国内对中国及其代理人的失望情绪正不断加剧。
"""The people have had enough of making requests to the government and being ignored,"" he said. ""Protests may be the only way to make them listen.""","""民众已经受够了诉求被政府无视的局面，""他说。""抗议可能是让他们倾听的唯一途径。"""
"It was a cold and overcast morning in November, but one full of promise for Guo Meiyan and her husband: They would finally get a chance to start a family.",那是去年11月一个寒冷阴沉的早晨，但对郭美艳和丈夫来说却充满了希望:他们终于有了生孩子的可能。
"As Ms. Guo, 39, was wheeled on a gurney into a hospital room where a doctor transferred her eggs, which had been harvested and fertilized, back into her uterus, she also felt a sense of dread.",躺在轮床上的郭女士被推进医院的一个房间，医生把之前从她身上取出的卵子进行了体外受精后，移植回她的子宫。此刻，39岁的她也有一种恐惧感。
"""If the transplant is not successful, all the money we spent will be wasted, all the pain I endured will be wasted, and we will have to start over again,"" said Ms. Guo, who had traveled 125 miles to Beijing from the northern city of Zhangjiakou. She and her husband had been living in hotels to be near the hospital for a month during the final stage of the in vitro fertilization process.","""如果(手术)不成功的花，钱也白花了，罪也白受了，又得从头来重做一次，""郭女士说，她是从200公里以外的张家口来北京这家医院的。她和丈夫已在附近的旅馆里住了一个月，以便在对卵子进行体外受精过程的最后阶段留在医院附近。"
"They are among hundreds of thousands of Chinese couples who turn to assisted reproductive technology every year after exhausting other options to get pregnant. They travel from all corners of the country to big cities like Beijing in the hopes of beating the odds of infertility. Many wait in long lines outside hospitals before sunrise, just for the possibility of a consultation.",每年有数十万对中国夫妇跟他们一样，在用尽各种方法仍无法怀孕后，转而求助于辅助生殖技术。这些不孕夫妇抱着战胜不孕症的希望，从全国各地来到北京这样的大城市。只是为了挂上就诊号，许多人在天不亮时就在医院外排起了长队。
"Now, the Chinese government wants to make the technology, which it made legal in 2001, more accessible. It has promised to cover some of the cost typically several thousand dollars for each round under national medical insurance. It is one of more than a dozen policy measures that Chinese officials are throwing at what they see as a very big problem a fertility rate so low that China's population has started to shrink.",现在，中国政府想让更多的人用上辅助生殖技术，该技术已在2001年合法化。政府已承诺将辅助生殖技术的部分费用纳入国家医疗保险覆盖范围，一个周期的体外受精费用通常是几万元人民币。这是中国官员为解决一个在他们看来非常大的问题——中国的生育率已经低到导致人口开始减少的程度——所采取的十多项政策措施之一。
"China has arrived at this turning point sooner than other countries at its stage of economic development, leading to what some demographers refer to as the curse of ""getting old before getting rich."" As fewer babies are born each year and China's oldest people live longer, the government is being forced to tackle a series of connected challenges a shrinking labor force, a fledgling pension system and a generation of young people who aren't interested in having babies.","从经济发展的角度来看，中国比其他国家更早地达到了这个人口转折点的时间，导致一些人口学家称为""未富先老""的祸端。随着中国每年出生的婴儿越来越少，而最年长人口的寿命越来越长，政府不得不应对一系列相互关联的挑战:劳动力萎缩、刚刚起步的养老金制度，以及对生育不感兴趣的一代年轻人。"
"Subsidizing fertility services like I.V.F., a technology that fertilizes eggs with sperm in a lab and transplants an embryo into the womb, is ""a big deal,"" said Lin Haiwei, the chief executive at Beijing Perfect Family Hospital, where Ms. Guo had her procedure. Patients go to great lengths to pay for fertility services. Some of them pool loans from relatives. Farmers time their appointments with the autumn harvest when they have money to pay.","北京家圆医院首席执行官林海伟说，为体外受精等生殖技术服务提供补贴""分量是很大的""。体外受精指的是在实验室里使卵子受精，形成胚胎后移植到子宫。郭女士就是在这家医院做的体外受精。不孕症患者为支付辅助生殖服务的费用竭尽全力。有些人从亲戚那里借钱。农民夫妇把就诊时间安排在秋收的时候，这样他们才有钱支付费用。"
"But even as there is a clear demand for fertility services, Mr. Lin said, the number of patients visiting the hospital is lower each year. ""The big picture is that people are less willing to have children,"" he said.","林海伟说，尽管对辅助生殖服务有明显需求，但来医院就诊的人数却逐年减少。""大背景是大家的生育意愿在降低，""他说。"
"This is the single biggest challenge facing China as it tries to reverse its falling birthrate. Young people complain about the financial burden of having children and their own economic uncertainty, and push back on traditional ideas about the woman's role as a caretaker at home. Many have expressed a desire to focus on their careers, while others have embraced a lifestyle known as ""double income, no kids.""","这是中国试图扭转出生率下降趋势所面临的最大挑战。年轻人抱怨生养孩子的经济负担和自身经济未来的不确定性，并对女性在家庭中的作用主要是照顾孩子的传统观念心存反感。许多人表示，希望将注意力放在自己的事业上，一些人接受了""丁克""(双收入，无孩子)的生活方式。"
"Despite this hurdle, officials are trying to push up one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. While experts say it would be nearly impossible for China's population to start growing again, the country could keep its birthrate steady. Making assisted reproductive technologies accessible to more people would help, just as it has helped in wealthier countries like Denmark, said Ayo Wahlberg, an anthropologist at the University of Copenhagen.",尽管存在这种障碍，但官员们仍在努力提高世界上最低的生育率之一。虽然专家说，让中国人口重新开始增长几乎不可能，但还是可以将出生率保持在稳定水平。哥本哈根大学的人类学家阿尤·瓦尔伯格说，让更多的人用上辅助生殖技术将有所帮助，就像在丹麦等较富裕国家那样。
"China recently promised to build at least one facility offering I.V.F. for every 2.3 million to three million people by 2025. It currently has 539 medical institutions and 27 sperm banks that have been approved to carry out assisted reproductive technology. Each year these facilities provide more than a million cycles of I.V.F. and other assisted fertility services. Around 300,000 babies are conceived.",中国最近承诺到2025年时，将为每230万至300万人口建立至少一个提供体外受精服务的辅助生殖设施。目前国内有539家提供这种服务的医疗机构和27家获准开展辅助生殖业务的精子库。这些机构每年提供的人类辅助生殖各项技术类别总周期数超过100万，出生婴儿数超过30万。
"Experts say these efforts are meaningful ways to help couples who want to have children. If China can scale up the services in an affordable way, it could even be a model for other countries that are facing similar challenges with infertility. But whether it will do much to change China's demographic trajectory is another question.",专家表示，这些努力为想生孩子的夫妇提供了有意义的帮助。如果中国能扩大辅助生殖服务的规模，让更多的人负担得起的话，甚至有可能成为其他面临类似不孕不育挑战的国家的榜样。但这项技术是否将在扭转中国人口趋势上起很大作用，则是另一个问题。
"""The problem is that it is putting a Band-Aid on a gushing wound,"" said Mr. Wahlberg, who is the author of a book on fertility in China.","""辅助生殖技术为中国的生育率问题帮不上大忙，""瓦尔伯格说，他著有一本关于中国生育问题的书。"
"For couples like Wang Fang and her husband, I.V.F. changed their lives. Ms. Wang went through two rounds of I.V.F. in 2016 before she gave birth to twins in 2017. Her husband's first marriage ended in divorce because they were unable to have a child.",辅助生殖技术改变了像王芳和她丈夫这样的夫妇的生活。王女士在2016年做了两个周期的体外受精后，于2017年生下一对双胞胎。她丈夫的第一次婚姻以离婚告终，因为他们无法生育。
"Both Ms. Wang, a factory worker, and her husband, an electrician, quit their jobs during the pregnancy to prepare for the birth.",王女士曾在一家工厂当工人，丈夫是电工。他们在她怀孕期间辞掉了工作，为生孩子做准备。
"When the first round of I.V.F. failed, the couple felt broken. They learned that they might need a sperm donor, something that Ms. Wang has kept a secret from the family. Her parents think the couple's fertility issues were due to her.",第一个周期的体外受精失败后，这对夫妇感到精疲力竭。医生告诉他们，他们可能需要使用他人捐献的精子。王女士一直对家人保密这件事。她的父母至今认为她和丈夫的生育问题出在她身上。
"""In our hometown, if you don't have children, you would not be able to hold your head high,"" Ms. Wang said. The second time they did I.V.F., the 14-day waiting period to determine if it was successful ""felt like a half a century,"" she said.","""如果没有孩子，在我们老家是抬不起头的，""王女士说。他们做了第二个周期的体外受精，等待确定是否成功的那14天""感觉像过了半个世纪一样""，她说。"
"As soon as they learned the outcome, they called everyone. Relatives offered to pitch in with their savings to help cover the costs, which exceeded $22,000, a huge sum for the couple, whose monthly household income was less than $1,200 when Ms. Wang and her husband were working.",得知成功后，他们马上给所有的人打了电话。亲戚们提出凑钱帮他们支付逾15万元的费用。王女士和丈夫工作时的家庭月收入不到8500元，15万元对他们来说是一笔巨款。
"""I.V.F. is not a one-time deal, and we ran out of our money after several big items, so we had to borrow money to continue,"" Ms. Wang said. If even some of those costs had been covered by medical insurance, as the government has said it will now start doing, ""it would certainly have helped us and relieved some pressure.""","""做试管婴儿不是一锤子买卖，出了几次大项后钱就没了，还要再去借钱继续之后的手术，""王女士说。如果医保能覆盖这些费用的一部分的话，就像政府现在保证将开始做的那样，""肯定能帮助我们缓解一些压力""。"
"Each round of I.V.F. can cost $5,000 to $12,000, and many couples need to do it as many as four or five times; each round has a success rate of roughly 30 percent. Under the new government measures, medical insurance would likely cover about half the cost of a round of I.V.F., said Mr. Lin at Beijing Perfect Family Hospital.",一个周期的人工受精费用从3.5万到8.5万元不等，许多夫妇需要做四五个周期的体外受精;每个周期的成功率大约为 30%。北京家圆医院的林海伟说，按照政府的新规定，医保可能会覆盖一个周期的体外受精费用的一半左右。
"The policy has not been put into effect, its details are unclear and a deadly outbreak of Covid could delay things. Still, Mr. Lin is optimistic that some version of the policy will be put into place in the coming months.",这项政策尚未生效，其细节也不清楚。国内新冠病毒疫情严重可能会导致事情推迟。尽管如此，林海伟仍对这项新政策的某个版本将在未来几个月内实施持乐观态度。
"But he's also realistic about its impact. ""It is certainly hard to expect much growth in our industry when the overall fertility rate and the willingness to have children are shrinking,"" Mr. Lin said.","但他对政策能产生的影响也很现实。""在社会总体生育率和生育意愿萎缩的情况下，我们肯定很难对我们行业的增长抱有很大预期，""林海伟说。"
"China has a complicated relationship with fertility. For three decades, officials restricted families to one child sometimes through brutal measures.",中国与生育问题的关系很复杂。官员们曾在三十年多年里限制家庭只生一个孩子，有时甚至为此采取残酷的措施。
"Today, infertility affects 18 percent of couples in China, compared with a global average of around 15 percent. Researchers cite several factors, including the fact that Chinese couples often wait until later to have children and the common use of abortions, which experts have said could affect fertility.",如今，中国有18%的夫妇受不孕不育困扰，而全球的平均比例约为15%。研究人员给出的几个因素包括，中国夫妇结婚后常常要等几年才要孩子，以及堕胎很常见，专家表示，堕胎可能会影响生育能力。
"Su Yue, 32, never had a strong desire to have a baby, but her husband and in-laws did. After the couple tried for several years, her mother-in-law gave them money to start I.V.F. treatment. They were successful last year.",现年32岁的苏玥(音)从没有过想要孩子的强烈愿望，但她丈夫和公婆却希望他们这样做。夫妻俩试了几年没成功后，婆婆给了他们钱，让他们开始接受体外受精治疗，去年生下一个儿子。
"Ms. Su loves her son, whom she refers to affectionately as ""Cookie."" But she said giving birth had cost her her job. She had been breastfeeding while working remotely, but then her boss required her to come into the office. As a career-minded millennial, she laments having to resign.","苏女士非常爱儿子，她亲昵地称他""饼干""。但她说生孩子让她失去了工作。在用母乳喂儿子的那段时间里，她一直远程工作，但后来老板要求她回办公室上班，她不得不辞了职。她属于有事业心的千禧一代，对辞职感到痛惜。"
"""The most stressful thing about I.V.F. is that I lost my job,"" Ms. Su said.","""做试管婴儿给我最大的压力，就是我丢了工作，""苏女士说。"
"Since her transplant, which was successful, in late November, Ms. Guo has been taking it easy back at home in Zhangjiakou. The hot pot restaurant that she and her husband own has been busy during the current Lunar New Year period. She still helps out, and she has found time to knit two mattress quilts for the baby.",去年11月底受精卵移植成功后，郭女士一直在张家口的家中从容地过着日子。今年春节期间，她和丈夫开的火锅店生意兴旺。她有时仍去帮帮忙，还抽空给宝宝织了两条被子。
"Mostly, though, she tries to rest in bed, Ms. Guo said. ""I feel sick and dizzy all the time.""","不过郭女士说，她大多数时间在卧床休息。""我总是感觉恶心、头晕。"""
"First, the accountant and the freelance writer were taken away. Then, the former tutor with a degree in English literature. And several days later, the police came for the editor at the Beijing publishing house.",最初被带走的是一名会计事务所职员和一名自由撰稿人。然后是拥有英国文学学位的培训机构教师。几天后，警察带走 了一位在北京一家出版社工作的编辑。
"The four detained women were friends. They spent their free time in China's capital as many curious, creative-minded young people did: hosting book clubs, watching movies, discussing social issues like feminism and L.G.B.T.Q. rights over barbecue. When protests against coronavirus restrictions broke out in November across China, including in Beijing, they attended. And now, they are among the first people known to have been formally arrested in connection with those protests.","这四名被拘留的女性是朋友。她们在中国首都度过闲暇时间的方式与许多有好奇心、有创造力的年轻人一样:办读书会、看电影，边吃烧烤边讨论女权主义和LGBTQ权益等社会问题。去年11月，当包括北京在内的中国各地都出现针对新冠""清零""政策的抗议时，她们参加了活动。现在，她们是已知的第一批因参加抗议活动而被警方逮走的人。"
"China is waging a campaign of intimidation against people who joined the demonstrations, which were the boldest challenge to the Communist Party's rule in decades and an embarrassing affront to its leader, Xi Jinping.",中国正在对活动抗议者进行恐吓威胁。这些抗议活动给中共统治带来了几十年来的最大胆挑战，也是令中共领导人习近平尴尬的冒犯。
"The party seems determined to warn off anyone who may have been emboldened by the remarkable outburst of public discontent, which was followed just days later by Beijing's abrupt decision to abandon Covid restrictions. Since then, domestic challenges have mounted: Youth unemployment is high, the economy is slowing, and Covid infections and deaths have accelerated.","中共似乎决意要警告那些可能会受这次公众不满情绪爆发鼓舞的人。中国政府在抗议活动发生后不久，突然决定放弃新冠""清零""，之后政府在国内面临的挑战不断增长:年轻人失业率居高不下，经济增长放缓，新冠病毒感染病例和死亡病例飙升。"
"The authorities have not officially announced the arrests and have largely avoided even acknowledging the protests. In seeking to tamp down unrest without further inflaming public anger, the party has often favored discreet repression.",当局尚未在官媒宣布这些逮捕行动，并尽力避免提及抗议活动。中共一直爱用秘密镇压来平息骚乱，以免进一步激起公众的愤怒。
"But news about the arrests as well as the interrogations and detentions of many other protesters has circulated widely among those who attended the demonstrations, or who cheered them on as hope for a rebirth of civil society. For many, the crackdown is a fresh reminder of the authorities' intolerance for even peaceful dissent, and of the personal risks that come with testing Beijing.",但警察抓人的消息，以及许多其他抗议者被询问和拘留的消息，已在参加过示威的人，还有曾为抗议者鼓与呼、期望公民社会复活的人当中广为流传。对许多人来说，镇压再次提醒人们，当局对即使是和平地表达异见也不容忍，并让人们重新意识到挑战政府所带来的个人风险。
"The party is also working to discredit the protesters by casting them as tools of malevolent foreign powers. Beijing has long dismissed dissent at home from calls for women's rights to pro-democracy activism to ethnic unrest as the result of Western-backed subversion. The protests against ""zero Covid"" were no exception: One Chinese diplomat suggested that some of the demonstrators had been ""bought by external forces.""","中共也一直在抹黑抗议者，试图将他们描述为境外势力的工具。从呼吁女性权益到倡导民主的活动、再到民族问题引发的骚乱——中国政府长期以来一直把国内异见说成是西方支持的颠覆活动，反对新冠""清零""的抗议活动也不例外。一名中国外交官表示，有些抗议者""被外部势力收买""。"
"The New York Times spoke with several people familiar with the cases of the four women who have been arrested. They requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, to provide details about the women's arrests and interrogations. The people have been closely tracking the women's cases, including from weeks earlier when the police began questioning them. They were either in touch with them before their arrests or with people close to them since they disappeared.",《纽约时报》采访了几名了解那四名被捕女性案件的人士。由于担心遭到报复，这些人在提供有关上述女性被捕和受审的详细情况时要求不具名。他们一直在密切跟踪这四名女性的案件进展，包括警方几周前审讯她们的情况。这些人或在四名女性被捕前与她们有联系，或在她们失踪后与和她们关系密切的人有联系。
"The police have asked the women about their use of overseas messaging platforms or involvement in feminist activities, such as reading groups, according to the people. Chinese propaganda has decried feminism as another tool of foreign influence.",据这些知情者说，警方已询问了四名女性使用海外即时通讯平台或参与女权活动(如读书会)的情况。中国宣传机器把女权主义嘲讽为外国势力的又一个工具。
"The women, for their part, have said they were driven by their own convictions and a belief that they had a right, even in China, to voice them. Before she was detained in December, one of the women, Cao Zhixin, the editor, recorded a video that she entrusted to friends to share if she went missing.",被捕的女性则表示，参加活动是受信念驱使，她们相信即使在中国也有表达自己观点的权利。其中一名女性是北大出版社编辑曹芷馨，她在去年12月被抓前录制了一段视频，并委托朋友在她失踪后将视频发到网上。
"""We care about this society,"" said Ms. Cao, 26, in the video, in which she said that the other three women Li Yuanjing, the accountant; Li Siqi, 27, the freelance writer; and Zhai Dengrui, the former literature student had already been taken away.","""我们关注这个社会，""26岁的曹芷馨在视频中说。她还表示，另外三名已被警方带走的女性是会计事务所职员李元婧、27岁的自由撰稿人李思琪，以及之前学文学专业的翟登蕊。"
"""At the scene, we respected public order, we didn't provoke any conflicts with the police,"" Ms. Cao continued. ""So why do you still have to secretly take us away?""","""在现场，我们遵守秩序，没有与警方发生任何冲突，""曹芷馨继续说道。""为什么还要悄无声息地带走我们?"""
"It is far from clear that the four women were targeted because of their interest in feminism. Other protesters may have also been arrested. Some Chinese social media users have tried to publicize the names of people missing since the protests, with various crowdsourced lists naming around two dozen people.",目前完全不清楚的是，这四名女性成为打击对象是否因为她们对女权主义感兴趣。可能还有其他的抗议者被捕。一些中国社交媒体用户试图公布抗议活动发生后失踪者的姓名，几个靠群力搜集的名单上有大约20名失踪者。
"But the legal system is opaque and social media is heavily censored, making a thorough accounting difficult. Under Chinese law, the police can detain people for more than a month without formally arresting them.",但中国的法律系统不透明，社交媒体受严格审查，这让将所有失踪者统计出来困难重重。按照中国法律，警方能在不正式逮捕的情况下将人拘留一个多月。
"But even if the authorities had not initially singled the women out for their feminist activities, once they were under investigation, those activities could have made them a target, said Lu Pin, a Chinese feminist activist who now lives in the United States, having faced harassment at home.",但即使当局一开始不是因为这几名女性的女权活动而将她们挑出来，警方对她们进行调查后，这些活动也有可能让她们成为打击目标，现居美国、曾在国内遭到警方骚扰的中国女权活动人士吕频说。
"""The Chinese government has to look for an explanation that fits their logic, and they don't believe that people organize on their own, according to their own political feeling. There must be a 'black hand,'"" Ms. Lu said. ""In China, feminism is the last active, visible social movement.""","""中国政府一定要去寻找一个按照他们理解的逻辑来理解这个事情，他们不相信人们是自发的组织起来的，是基于他们的政治感组织起来的，他们背后一定有一个某后的黑手，""吕频表示。""在中国女权已经是最后的一个活跃的，可见的一个社会运动。"""
"The protest in Beijing on Nov. 27 began as a candlelight vigil for at least 10 people who died in an apartment fire in the far-western region of Xinjiang in November. Many Chinese believed that Covid restrictions had prevented the victims from escaping, though the government denied that.","北京去年11月27日的抗议活动是以烛光守夜活动开始的，以悼念当月新疆一场公寓楼火灾中死亡的至少10名遇难者。许多中国人认为，新冠""清零""措施阻碍了遇难者逃出公寓楼，尽管政府否认了这个说法。"
"The women had attended out of grief, Ms. Cao, the editor, said in her video.",曹芷馨在视频中说，她们参加活动是出于悲痛。
"""We have legitimate emotions to express when our compatriots are killed, we are full of sympathy for those who lost their lives that is why we went,"" Ms. Cao said.","""我们的同胞遇难时，有合理的情绪想要表达，我们对失去生命的人充满同情，所以我们才去了现场，""曹芷馨说。"
"That night, the Beijing police were relatively restrained, even as the vigil turned into a street protest calling for an end to ""zero Covid"" and greater political freedoms. Officers filmed participants but did not aggressively detain people on site.","抗议活动当晚，北京警方的做法相对克制，即使是在守夜活动变成了要求结束新冠""清零""和要求更多政治自由的街头抗议后。虽然警察对参与者进行了拍摄，但没有在现场声势浩大地抓人。"
"One official, witnessed by a Times reporter, told protesters that he also mourned for those who had died in the fire. Another reminded marchers, ""No one has touched you.""","时报记者当时曾听到一名警察对抗议者说，他也哀悼在火灾中丧生的人。另一名警察提醒游行者，""没有人跟你们动过手。"""
"But that soon changed. In the days afterward, people who had attended protests in Beijing and other cities described being summoned or visited at home by officers, who asked why they had gone to the demonstrations, and with whom. Some were told their phone location data had been used to track them down. China's ambassador to France, Lu Shaye, called the protesters pawns of ""foreign forces,"" then refused to give evidence for that when asked by reporters.","但情况很快发生了变化。在之后的几天里，据参加过北京和其他城市的抗议活动的人描述，他们被警察传唤或登门，警察问他们为什么参加示威，和谁一起去的。有些人被告知，警察用他们手机的定位数据对他们进行追踪。中国驻法国大使卢沙野称抗议者受了""外部势力""操纵，但在记者的追问下拒绝提供证据。"
"A similar theme may have emerged in the police interrogations of the four women, according to the people familiar with their cases.",据了解这四名女性情况的人士，类似的说法也许贯穿在警方对她们的审讯中。
"The police asked about the women's book clubs, where they had read Chizuko Ueno, a prominent Japanese feminist scholar. They pointed to their use of Telegram, the messaging app, which is blocked in China without special software. At least some of the women had studied overseas.",警察询问了读书会的情况，她们曾在那里读了日本著名女权主义学者上野千鹤子的书。警方指出她们使用了即时通讯应用程序Telegram，这个应用在中国被屏蔽，需要翻墙软件才能使用。至少一些参加了抗议活动的女性有在海外念书的经历。
"The police have accused the women of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble,"" the people familiar with the cases said a vague crime that the authorities often charge critics with to silence them. It is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.","了解情况的人说，警方指控这几名女性的罪名是""寻衅滋事""，这个模糊的罪名是当局为了使批评者噤声常用的指控，最高可判处五年有期徒刑。"
"Reached by telephone, an official with the Beijing public security bureau said that no one would be available for comment until after the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.",记者通过电话联系到北京市公安局的一名官员，他说，在为期一周春节假日期间，没人能对本文置评。
"Ms. Lu, the feminist activist in the United States, said the police's evident focus on people who were not prominent organizers, or even apparently part of any larger group, underscored how the authorities had decimated civil society.",吕频说，警方显然把注意力集中到了这些不是主要组织者，甚至看来不属于任何更大群体的人身上，凸显出当局已把中国的公民社会摧毁到了什么程度。
"""After all the repression, in the eyes of the police, these people have become the most threatening forces,"" she said. ""These communities that normally would not be considered political people eating together, watching movies, talking about art at key times, these can have the potential for political activation.""","""经过所有的打击之后，这些人在警察看来已经成了最危险的势力，""她说。""吃饭看电影，谈艺术或者文学，这个社群平时几乎都不带政治标签，但在关键的时候成了一种潜在的政治上面的激活。"""
"The authorities' primary motivation in moving forward with the cases is probably not suppressing these women in particular, but more generally warning others who might have drawn inspiration from the demonstrations.",当局对她们进行办案处理的主要动机可能不是专门为了打击这些女性，而是为了警告那些可能从这次示威活动中受到启发的人。
"While there have been no large-scale repeats of the politically charged protests late last year, sporadic demonstrations on more discrete issues have continued in recent weeks. The government's about-face on ""zero Covid"" has led pandemic control workers to rally to demand unpaid wages. The soaring deaths and illness that have followed the sudden loosening could also stoke anger, said Steve Tsang, the director of the SOAS China Institute in London.","虽然在去年年底带有政治色彩的抗议活动后并没有再发生类似的大规模活动，但小规模的、针对更具地问题的零星示威活动仍在最近几周继续上演。政府在新冠""清零""政策上的180度大转弯导致之前的防疫人员聚集起来，要求把拖欠的工资发给他们。伦敦大学亚非学院中国研究院院长曾锐生说，突然放弃""清零""后出现的死亡人数和感染人数激增也可能引发人们的愤怒。"
"""In the long term, the damage to the reputation and legitimacy of both the party and Xi Jinping, I think, is significant,"" Professor Tsang said. And having seen that damage turn into political protest, he added, ""intimidation is basically what is being done to make sure that it doesn't come back.""","""从长远来看，我认为，这对中共和习近平的声誉和合法性有很大损害，""曾锐生说。他还表示，在看到损害变成了政治抗议后，""对抗议者们进行恐吓威胁从根本上来说，是为了确保抗议活动不再发生。"""
"SINGAPORE They left after the government cracked down on the private sector. They ran away from a harsh ""zero Covid"" policy. They searched for safe havens for their wealth and their families.","新加坡——他们离开了中国，有的是因为政府对民营企业的监管打压，有的是为了躲避严厉的新冠""清零""政策。他们都在为自己的财富和家人寻找安全的避风港。"
"They went to Singapore, Dubai, Malta, London, Tokyo and New York anywhere but their home country of China, where they felt that their assets, and their personal safety, were increasingly at the mercy of the authoritarian government.",他们去了新加坡、迪拜、马耳他、伦敦、东京和纽约，只要能出去，什么地方都行。在国内，他们觉得自己的资产和人身安全越来越受到中国威权主义政府的摆布。
"In 2022, a year that proved extremely challenging for China, many Chinese businesspeople moved abroad, temporarily or for good. They were part of a wave of emigration that led to one of the year's top online catchphrases, ""runxue,"" understood to mean running away from China.","2022年对中国来说是极具挑战性的一年，许多商界人士移居国外，有的是暂时的，有的是永久的。他们加入到一波移民潮中，成了去年最热门的网络流行语之一""润学""(意思是如何逃离中国)的践行者。"
"A consequential, if privileged, piece of China's economic puzzle, these people are pulling their wealth and businesses out at a time when growth is at its lowest point in decades.",这些人正在将他们的财富和企业撤走，而且是在中国经济增长率降到几十年来的最低点时。他们在中国经济中有相当的份量，可以说是特权阶层。
"Many of them are still scarred by the last few years, during which China's leadership went after the country's biggest private enterprises, vilified its most celebrated entrepreneurs, decimated entire industries with arbitrary regulation and refused to budge on Covid policies when many businesses were struggling.","过去几年发生的事情给他们中的许多人留下了精神创伤。中国领导层在过去几年里处罚了国内最大的民营企业，诋毁国内最著名的企业家，用武断的监管摧毁整个行业，而且在许多企业陷入困境时，拒绝在新冠""清零""政策上让步。"
"While the government's tone and policies have turned more business-friendly in recent weeks, the entrepreneur class, who have lost revenue, fortunes and, most of all, confidence in the leadership, will not easily be swayed.",虽然政府已在最近几周转向对商业更友好的调子和政策，但企业家阶层不会被轻易说服，他们的收入和财富已经减少，而且最重要的是，他们失去了对领导层的信心。
"Now that they have lived free of fear in other countries, they are reluctant to put themselves and their businesses under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party again, a number of them told me during discussions in Asia, Europe and the United States. At least, not until they can be assured the state will have to follow the same laws as the citizens.",现在他们已经在其他国家没有恐惧地生活，他们不会轻易将自己和自己的企业再次置于中共控制之下，至少不会在他们能确保政府将和老百姓一样按照法律行事之前——这是我与他们中的一些人在亚洲、欧洲和美国交谈时听到的。
"""When you don't have a say in how a government makes rules, you don't have to stay there,"" said Aginny Wang, a co-founder of a crypto banking start-up, Flashwire, who moved from Beijing to Singapore in June after getting trapped in Shanghai's Covid lockdown on a business trip. ""There are many other places where you can do things.""","""你对政府如何制定规则没有发言权时，就不必留在那里，""加密货币银行初创公司Flashwire的联合创始人阿金尼·王(音)说。他在上海出差期间因封城被困后，于去年6月从北京移居到新加坡。""还有很多其他可以做事的地方。"""
"As they searched for such a place, many in China's business elite zeroed in on Singapore.",寻找去处的时候，许多中国商界精英将目光投向了新加坡。
"In a small office in that city-state's central business district, J.C. Huo was constantly taking calls as he served visitors tea from a bamboo tray.",在这个城邦国家中央商务区的一间小办公室里，J.C.霍(音)一边忙着接听电话，一边用一个竹托盘把茶递给来访者。
"Mr. Huo, the founder of Lotusia, an advisory firm that handles business registrations and visa applications in Singapore, said his Chinese client list had quickly expanded over the past year. People in the education, games, cryptocurrency and fintech industries in China all targets of government crackdowns over the last few years had sought his services.",霍先生是咨询公司Lotusia的创始人，处理在新加坡注册公司、申请签证的业务。他说，他的中国客户名单在过去一年里迅速增长。不少来自中国教育、游戏、加密货币和金融科技行业的人都在寻求他的服务，这些行业都是政府过去几年打击的目标。
"During the Shanghai lockdown, his phone lines ""were ringing off the hook,"" he said. The wealthy, he said, realized that no matter how much money they had, they still had to scramble for food and supplies under the harsh restrictions of ""zero Covid.""","他说，上海封城期间他的电话""一直响个不停""。富人们意识到，无论有多少钱，在新冠""清零""的严格限制下，他们还是要去抢食物和物资。"
"Even during the past few weeks, after the Chinese government rolled out the red carpet for the private sector and Hong Kong vowed to attract crypto talent from mainland China, Mr. Huo has been busy fielding requests.",即使在几周前，中国政府重新表示欢迎民营企业、香港誓言要吸引来自中国大陆的加密货币人才后，霍先生也一直在忙着处理申请。
"""The entrepreneurs are still pessimistic,"" he said. ""As long as people are worried about their assets, they'll register their companies in Singapore and put their money here.""","""企业家们仍然很悲观，""他说。""只要人们担心自己的资产，他们就会在新加坡注册公司，把钱放在这里。"""
"For such people, Singapore works because about three million of its citizens, or three quarters, are ethnic Chinese, and many speak Mandarin. They also like that it is business-friendly, global-minded and, most of all, upholds the rule of law.",这些人选中新加坡是因为，该国有大约300万公民(即75%的人口)是华人，许多人会说普通话。他们也喜欢新加坡的亲商氛围和全球视野，而且最重要的是，新加坡坚持依法治国。
"People in the West may bristle at Singapore's limitations on individual freedom. But for most Chinese, a government that respects the rule of law and doesn't arbitrarily change its policies is good enough.",西方人也许会对新加坡限制个人自由感到恼火，但对大多数中国人来说，一个尊重法治、不随意改变政策的政府已经足够了。
"""Singapore will not crack down on a company or an industry outside its legal framework,"" said Chen Yong, founder of Pionex, a cryptocurrency exchange, who moved there from Beijing in 2021. ""Its policies have more continuity.""","""新加坡不会在法律框架之外打击一家公司或一个行业，""加密货币交易所Pionex的创始人陈勇(音)说，他已在2021年从北京搬到新加坡。""它的政策更有连续性。"""
"Mr. Chen and others I met in Singapore said they had no intention of moving to Hong Kong, despite that city's enthusiastic attempts to woo people like them in recent months.",陈先生以及我在新加坡见到的其他人都说，他们不会搬去香港，尽管香港近几个月来一直在积极吸引像他们这样的人才。
"For decades, Hong Kong played the role of safe haven for mainland entrepreneurs because of its autonomy from China. That crumbled after Beijing introduced a national security law in the territory in 2020, ushering in the arrest of activists, the seizure of assets, the detention of newspaper editors, the rewriting of school curriculums and what many see as the compromising of judicial independence.",在不受中国大陆管辖的几十年时间里，香港曾为内地企业家起过避风港的作用。中央政府2020年在香港实施国家安全法后，情况就变了，当地政府开始逮捕活动人士、没收资产、监禁报社编辑、改写教科书，让许多人认为香港不再有司法独立。
"Mr. Chen moved to Singapore because crypto trading, his industry, is banned in China. He kept some developers in the country, but most of his operations are outside it. He said being in Singapore helped him to think more globally. And he was skeptical that Hong Kong could separate its crypto policies from Beijing's.",陈先生搬到了新加坡，因为中国大陆禁止他想从事的行业——加密货币交易。虽然他在国内保留了一些开发人员，但他的大部分业务目前在国外。他说，住在新加坡有助于他放眼全球。他对香港能将其加密货币政策与北京的分开表示怀疑。
"""When entrepreneurs chose to move to Singapore, it means they have chosen to leave China,"" he said. Hong Kong is not attractive to people who have made that choice, he added.","""企业家选择搬到新加坡，意味着他们已经选择要离开中国，""他说。香港对做出这种选择的人没有吸引力，他补充道。"
Singapore has become a strong rival to Hong Kong as a place for China's superrich to park their wealth. Four of the 10 wealthiest Singaporeans on Forbes's billionaire list are recent Chinese immigrants. So many people arrived last year that a start-up founder told me he had put on weight from all the welcome dinners.,新加坡已成为与香港竞争作为中国超级富豪存放财富之地的强劲对手。福布斯亿万富豪榜上最富有的10名新加坡人中，有四名是来自中国的新移民。去年从中国来新加坡的人那么多，以至于一名初创公司创始人告诉我，他吃欢迎宴都吃胖了。
"The rush of elite Chinese businesspeople to Singapore has contributed to a rise in the cost of living there. Average rent for a 1,000-square-foot condo apartment was about $3,500 a month at the end of September, up more than one-fifth from the start of 2022, according to 99.co, a property portal. The cost of a license to own a vehicle rose by nearly 40 percent last year.","中国商界精英涌入新加坡导致了当地生活成本上升。房地产门户网站99.co的数据显示，截至去年9月底，一套面积约100平米的公寓平均租金大约相当于每月3500美元，比2022年初涨了20%以上。购买""拥车证""的费用去年上涨了近40%。"
Singapore is also competing with Hong Kong as a place for mainland Chinese companies to register separate entities for their international operations. Some entrepreneurs want to build up their global brands by identifying as Singaporean companies.,新加坡也在与香港竞争，以成为中国大陆企业为其国际业务注册独立实体的地方。一些企业家想用其新加坡公司的身份建立自己的全球品牌。
"To the outside world, ""Hong Kong is part of China while Singapore is not,"" said Yu-Ning Liu, the founder of Karma Games in Beijing, which develops games played by people around the world.","世界知道""香港是中国的一部分，但新加坡不是""，北京羯磨科技的创始人刘宇宁说，该公司专注于出海游戏。"
Mr. Liu is moving his Hong Kong operations to the city-state. He says he will start using his Singapore entity to release and market games for international markets.,刘宇宁正在将他的香港业务转移到新加坡。他说，他将开始使用他在新加坡注册的名字向国际市场发布和推广游戏。
"Singapore has also emerged as something of a buffer zone as geopolitical tensions between China and the United States escalate. For some, a passport from Singapore is attractive because it has good relations with both countries.",随着中美地缘政治紧张局势升级，新加坡也成了一个类似缓冲区的地方。新加坡护照对一些人有吸引力，因为新加坡与中美都保持着良好关系。
"Governments around the world are increasingly wary of Beijing's influence on Chinese businesses. Many want to know whether those companies are keeping their citizens' personal data safe, and whether investments by Chinese entities have implications for national security.",世界各国的政府越来越担心中国政府对国内企业的影响。许多政府想知道，这些中国公司能否保护他们公民个人数据的安全，也想知道来自中国实体的投资是否会影响他们的国家安全。
"Such scrutiny has led some Chinese entrepreneurs to seek foreign passports, or at least permanent resident status in other countries. A few told me that they feared their Chinese passports could leave them vulnerable if China should invade Taiwan, provoking the kind of sanctions imposed on Russia and its businesses since the war in Ukraine began.",这种对企业的审查已促使一些中国企业家寻求获得外国护照，或至少是获得其他国家的永久居民身份。个别人告诉我，他们担心如果中国入侵台湾，持有中国护照会让他们易受制裁的影响，就像西方国家因俄罗斯入侵乌克兰而对该国及其企业实施的制裁一样。
"Entrepreneurs in Singapore admit that it has its limitations. It's small, it's expensive and the talent pool is shallow. It's an easy place to enjoy life but not ideal for starting, say, an ambitious tech company, many of them say. Some wealthy, relatively young Chinese who have moved there don't have much to do but drink a lot of Moutai, the Chinese liquor.",新加坡的企业家承认该国有自己的局限性。新加坡很小，生活费用很高，人才资源很少。他们中的许多人说，新加坡是一个享受生活的好地方，不是创办一家雄心勃勃科技企业的理想之地。一些移居到那里的相对年轻的中国富人除了大喝茅台外，没有太多的事可做。
"Nearly all would have preferred to stay in China, if the circumstances had been different. It is a colossal market with great infrastructure, the best supply chain in the world and an abundant supply of programmers willing to work overtime.",如果情况有所不同的话，几乎所有我采访的人都更想留在中国。中国有巨大的市场、完善的基础设施、世界上最好的供应链，以及大量愿意加班的程序员。
"Most of them still maintain some business operations there. But they're not going to rush back, invest more and open new businesses just because the government cajoled them.",他们中的大多数人仍在中国保留着一些业务。但他们不会只是因为政府的劝诱就匆匆回国，在那里增加投资、开办新企业。
"""The entrepreneurs don't dare to take risks any more,"" said Mr. Huo, the business adviser. ""They have to think twice before doing anything whether they'll put their safety into jeopardy.""","""企业家们不敢再冒险了，""商业顾问霍先生说。""他们在做任何事情之前不得不三思而后行，看看会不会把自己的安全置于危险之中。"""
"New data released this week by the Chinese government revealed that China's population has begun to shrink, a momentous shift that will have broad ripple effects both domestically and globally.",中国政府本周发布的新数据显示，中国人口已经开始负增长，这一重大转变将在国内和全球产生广泛的连锁反应。
The government said on Tuesday that deaths last year in China had outnumbered births for the first time in decades.,政府周二表示，去年中国的死亡人数几十年来首次超过出生人数。
"This could spell the end of China's position as the world's most populous country, a transition that could profoundly reshape the global economy in the long run. India's total population is expected to surpass China's later this year, according to a recent estimate from the United Nations. Here's why economists and others are alarmed by the developments.",这可能意味着中国不再是世界上人口最多的国家，从长远来看，这一转变可能会深刻地重塑全球经济。根据联合国的最新估算，印度的总人口预计将在今年晚些时候超过中国。以下是经济学家和其他人士对事态发展感到担忧的原因。
China's shrinking work force could hobble the global economy.,中国不断萎缩的劳动力可能会拖累全球经济。
"For years, China's massive working-age population powered the global economic engine, supplying the factory workers whose cheap labor produced goods that were exported around the world.",多年来，中国庞大的适龄劳动人口为全球经济引擎提供动力，为工厂提供廉价劳动力，他们生产的商品出口到世界各地。
"In the long run, a shortage of factory workers in China driven by a more educated work force and a shrinking population of young people could raise costs for consumers outside China, potentially exacerbating inflation in countries like the United States that rely heavily on imported Chinese products. Facing rising labor costs in China, many companies have already been shifting their manufacturing operations to lower-paying countries like Vietnam and Mexico.",劳动力受教育程度的提升，加上年轻人的减少，推动了中国工厂的工人短缺，从长远来看，这可能会增加中国境外消费者的成本，加剧美国等严重依赖进口中国产品的国家的通货膨胀。面对中国不断上涨的劳动力成本，许多公司已经将制造业务转移到越南和墨西哥等工资较低的国家。
"A shrinking population could also mean a decline in spending from Chinese consumers, threatening global brands dependent on sales of products to China, from Apple smartphones to Nike sneakers.",人口负增长也可能意味着中国消费者的支出下降，威胁到从苹果智能手机到耐克运动鞋等依赖中国市场的全球品牌。
The data is bad news for China's crucial housing market.,该数据对中国至关重要的房地产市场来说是个坏消息。
"In the short term, a plunging birthrate poses a major threat to China's real estate sector, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the country's economic output. Population growth is a key driver of housing demand, and homeownership is the most important asset for many Chinese people. During widespread pandemic lockdowns that dampened consumer spending and export growth, China's economy became even more dependent on the ailing housing sector.",短期内，出生率下降对中国的房地产行业构成重大威胁，该行业约占该国经济产出的四分之一。人口增长是住房需求的主要驱动力，而拥有住房是许多中国人最重要的资产。在大规模封锁期间，消费者支出和出口增长遭到抑制，中国经济变得更加依赖不景气的房地产行业。
The government recently intervened to help distressed real estate developers in an attempt to stem the fallout of its housing crisis.,政府最近进行了干预，帮助陷入困境的房地产开发商，试图遏制住房危机的影响。
China's shrinking work force may not be able to support its growing aging population.,中国不断减少的劳动力可能无法支持其不断增长的老龄化人口。
"With fewer working-age people in the long run, the government could struggle to pay for an enormous population that is growing older and living longer. A 2019 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted that the country's main pension fund would run out of money by 2035, in part because of the shrinking work force.",从长远来看，随着适龄劳动力人口的减少，政府可能难以为日益老龄化和更长寿的庞大人口埋单。中国社会科学院2019年的一份报告预测，到2035年，中国的主要养老基金将耗尽，一定程度上是劳动力减少所致。
Economists have compared China's demographic crisis to the one that stalled Japan's economic boom in the 1990s.,经济学家将中国的人口危机与1990年代令日本的经济繁荣陷入停滞的危机相提并论。
But China does not have the same resources as a country like Japan to provide a safety net for its aging population. Its households live on much lower incomes on average than in the U.S. and elsewhere. Many older Chinese residents rely on state pension payments as a key source of income during retirement.,但中国没有像日本那样的资源来为其老龄化人口提供安全网。中国家庭的平均收入与美国和其他地方相比要低得多。许多年长的中国居民依靠国家养老金作为退休后的主要收入来源。
"China also has some of the lowest retirement ages in the world, with most workers retiring by age 60. The situation has imposed tremendous strain not only on state pension funds, but also on the country's hospital system.",中国也是世界上退休年龄最低的国家之一，大多数工作者在60岁退休。这种情况不仅给国家养老基金带来了巨大压力，也给医院系统带来了巨大压力。
The crisis has been decades in the making.,这场危机已经酝酿了几十年。
"China introduced the one-child policy in the late 1970s, arguing that it was necessary to keep population growth from reaching unsustainable levels. The government imposed onerous fines on most couples who had more than one child and compelled hundreds of millions of Chinese women to have abortions. Many families favored boys over girls, often aborting baby girls or abandoning them at birth, resulting in a huge surplus of single men in the Chinese population.",中国在20世纪70年代后期开始实行独生子女政策，它当时认为有必要防止人口增长达到不可持续的水平。政府对大多数拥有多于一个孩子的夫妇处以巨额罚款，并强迫数亿中国女性堕胎。许多家庭重男轻女，经常将女婴引产或遗弃，导致中国人口中单身男性大量过剩。
"China announced the relaxing of family size restrictions in 2013, but many demographic experts said the change had come too late to change the country's population trajectory.",中国在2013年宣布放宽家庭人数限制，但许多人口专家表示，这一变化来得太晚，无法改变该国的人口走势。
There are no easy fixes to the problem.,这个问题没有简单的解决办法。
"The government's efforts to spur a baby boom to solve the demographic crisis including offering cash handouts and easing the one-child policy to allow for three children have failed to stabilize falling birthrates. Educated Chinese women are increasingly delaying marriage and choosing not to have children, deterred by the high cost of housing and education.",政府为解决人口危机而刺激生育高峰的努力——包括提供现金补助和放宽独生子女政策以允许生育三个孩子——未能稳定下降的出生率。由于住房和教育成本高昂，受过教育的中国女性越来越多地推迟结婚并选择不生孩子。
"China has also been unwilling to loosen immigration rules to boost the population, historically issuing relatively few green cards to replenish its shrinking work force.",中国也一直不愿放宽移民规定以增加人口，历来发行的绿卡数量相对较少，不足以补充不断减少的劳动力。
"To address the labor shortage, China has been outsourcing low-skilled production to other countries in Asia and adding more automation to its factories, hoping to rely more on artificial intelligence and technology sectors for future growth.",为解决劳动力短缺问题，中国一直将低技能生产外包给亚洲其他国家，并为其工厂增加更多自动化设备，希望更多地依赖人工智能和技术领域来实现未来增长。
"China's leaders have long known that the country is nearing a demographic crossroads. Policymakers have warned that China must prepare for a slowly shrinking population and an era of fewer workers and more retirees. State media have urged young couples to seize the opportunity to have two or three children under relaxed family-size rules, to soften the looming economic crunch.",中国领导层早就知道该国正在接近一个人口拐点。政策制定者警告，中国必须为人口萎缩以及劳动力减少、退休人员增多的时代做好准备。官媒已敦促年轻夫妇抓紧时机生两到三个孩子，政府为缓解即将出现的经济困境，已放开了对生育的限制。
"And yet the sense of incipient crisis grew on Tuesday, when the government confirmed that the nation's population shrank last year for the first time in six decades, sooner and sharper than many experts had forecast.",然而，当政府在周二证实，中国人口在去年出现了60年来的首次下降，拐点比许多专家的预测来得更快、更突然时，危机初现的感受变得更加强烈了。
"Even if Chinese officials have warned that a demographic Rubicon was approaching, their preparations have not kept pace with the long-term needs of an aging society, in the eyes of many experts and Chinese people.",尽管中国官员已对人口将出现无法逆转的拐点发出了警告，但在许多专家和中国民众看来，他们还没有为老龄化社会的长期需求做好充分准备。
"China's abrupt abandonment of ""zero Covid"" controls exposed a government ill prepared for an explosion in infections. And, similarly, the mounting population pressures may reveal a government that has not done enough to avoid tough choices in coming decades over rival priorities. Between the demands of caring for young and old. Between paying for social welfare and building up China's technological and military might.","中国突然放弃新冠""清零""政策的做法暴露了政府对感染的暴发准备不足。与之类似，不断增长的人口压力可能会暴露出政府尚未采取足够措施来避免未来几十年可能面临的局面，即被迫在相互竞争的优先事项上做出艰难选择。比如，如何满足照料幼童与照料老年人的不同需求。是把钱花在支付社会福利上，还是花在建设技术和军事实力上。"
"China's leader, Xi Jinping, has partly sought to tackle the long-term economic and social pressures from a shrinking, aging society more by lifting the limits on family size. He has taken steps to build a strong social safety net and announced a new phase of ""high-quality"" growth less dependent on legions of cheap, abundant migrant workers from the countryside.","中国领导人习近平已在一定程度上寻求通过取消对生育的限制，来缓解一个人口不断缩小的老龄化社会所面临的长期经济和社会压力。他已采取步骤建立一个强大的社会安全网，并宣布经济进入了一个""高质量""增长的新阶段，减少了对廉价、充裕的农民工大军的依赖。"
"""The population issue is the most important issue for the future and yet the one that is most easily neglected,"" Ren Zeping, a former chief economist for the Evergrande Group, a massive housing developer, who has studied the looming demographic crunch, wrote in a widely circulated comment after the figures were released Tuesday. Mr. Ren called for more energetic policy-making, including birth subsidies, stronger paternity and maternity leave, and improved protection of women's rights in the workplace.","""人口问题是未来最重要又最容易被忽视的问题，""任泽平在周二的数据公布后写道，他的这条评论在网上广泛流传。任泽平曾在大型房地产开发商恒大集团担任首席经济学家，研究过迫在眉睫的人口危机。他呼吁政府制定更积极的政策，包括生育补贴、更长的产假和陪产假，以及加强对职场女性权益的保护。"
"After the latest population statistics were released, many suggested in social media posts and in interviews that the government's moves may be too little and too late. To many, the government has barely begun to tackle the deeper reasons many young couples choose to have one child or none at all, like the costs of rearing and educating children and lack of substantial government support, especially for women, at home and in the workplace.",最新的人口统计数据公布后，许多发在社交媒体上的帖子和接受采访的人都暗示，政府的措施也许并不足够，且为时已晚。在许多人看来，政府几乎还没有开始着手解决许多年轻夫妇选择只生一个孩子、或一个孩子都不要的更深层原因，比如抚养成本和教育成本，以及缺乏政府实质性的支持，无论是在家里还是在工作场所，尤其是对女性而言。
"""I'd like to have a kid, but the living pressures are just too much,"" Wu Yilan, a 34-year-old shopkeeper in Beijing, said in a telephone interview. She said she had discussed it with a former boyfriend. ""If I settle down with a partner, I'd probably think that one child is enough.""","""想生孩子，但是生活压力实在太大，""现年34岁的北京店主吴一兰(音)在接受电话采访时说。她说她和前男友讨论过这个问题。""如果有对象，大概想生一个就好。"""
"Anxiety and argument about China's new demographic era have been building as birthrates have slowed, especially in recent years. It has now hit a turning point: China's population in 2022 fell by 850,000, with more deaths than births for the first time since a famine in the early 1960s caused by Mao Zedong's calamitous social experiment, Great Leap Forward.","随着出生率的下降，有关中国人口新时代的焦虑和争论一直在加剧，尤其是在最近几年，现已到了一个转折点:中国人口在2022年减少了85万，这是自20世纪60年代初以来，中国的死亡人数首次超过了出生人数。上次人口减少是毛泽东灾难性的社会实验""大跃进""导致的饥荒造成的。"
"Chinese demographers, economists and business leaders have offered a number of ideas to support a growing number of older people and encourage couples to have more children. In 2016, the government eased the ""one-child"" policy that had been enforced for over three decades, allowing families to have two children. In 2021, it increased the limit to three.","在如何赡养越来越多的老年人、鼓励夫妇生更多孩子方面，中国的人口学家、经济学家和工商界领袖已提出了许多想法。政府已在2016年取消了实施三十多年的""独生子女""政策，允许夫妇生两个孩子，后在2021年提高到允许生三个。"
"Even so, most couples still stick to having one child, while two is common in the countryside. Many young people, especially women, remain skeptical that the government is going to make it easier for them to both have children and remain in the formal work force.",尽管如此，大多数夫妇仍只生一个孩子，虽然两个孩子的情况在农村比较普遍。许多年轻人，尤其是女性，对政府是否会让她们生孩子后还能保住工作变得更容易持怀疑态度。
"Jennie Liu, a 32-year-old podcast platform manager in Shanghai, said that she and her boyfriend agreed that they would like to raise one or two children but only if they could ""run,"" a Chinese buzzword for moving abroad.","上海一个播客平台的经理、现年32岁的珍妮·刘(音)说，她和男友同意生一到两个孩子，但前提是他们能""润""出去。""润""是个目前流行的词，指的是离开中国。"
"""If we can run to somewhere with better welfare and an improved overall social environment where a child can obtain residency status, then we may think about having a kid,"" she said. In China, ""the aging population and decline of the working-age population will definitely put pressure on government finances.""","""如果润去一个福利更好、社会环境整体更优、小孩可以拿身份的地方，可能会考虑生一个小孩，""她说。中国的""人口老龄化和适龄劳动人口的下降，未来一定会对财政有压力""。"
"The societal issues run deep. After Tuesday's data release, some on the Chinese internet said that despite government promises of a fairer deal for women, many employers did not want to employ women in better, steady jobs, because they did not want to deal with maternity leave and child care.",社会的问题根深蒂固。周二的数据公布后，中国互联网上有些人表示，尽管政府承诺让女性得到更公平的待遇，但许多雇主由于不想考虑产假和育儿的问题，对于更好、更稳定的职位不愿考虑女性。
"""In the job market, they worry that if you're 23-30, you'll get married and have a kid, that if you're 30-35 you'll have a second or third one, and if you're over 35, then sorry,"" read one comment. ""This kind of social setting is already the best form of contraception. All those policies to encourage births and open up will amount to nothing.""","""职场23-30岁怕你去结婚生子，30-35岁怕你生二胎三胎。35岁+不好意思，连公务员和体制内都带头不招人了，""网上一条评论写道。""这样的社会环境，就已经是最好的避孕药。所有的催生和放开政策都将无济于事。"""
"The measures championed by Chinese policymakers often neglect the broader pressures on women, especially those from rural and working-class backgrounds, which put them in a painful bind between family and work, said Yige Dong, an assistant professor of sociology at the University at Buffalo, which is part of the State University of New York system.",中国政策制定者倡导的措施往往忽视了女性面临的更广泛压力，尤其是那些来自农村和工人阶级背景的女性，这让她们在家庭和工作之间陷入痛苦的两难，布法罗大学社会学助理教授董一格说。该校是纽约州立大学系统的一部分。
"Families face intense pressure to get children into better schools, with much of the burden falling on mothers who are often also often expected to care for aged parents and parents-in-law.",家庭面临着让孩子上最好的学校的巨大压力，这种压力大部分落在母亲身上，她们还经常被指望照顾年迈的父母和公婆。
"""They are caught between the demand to go to work and the demands for intensive parenting,"" Ms. Dong said, citing interviews with female migrant workers in central China.","""她们夹在需要工作与集约型养育的需求之间，""董一格说，这是她采访中国中部的女性农民工得出的结论。"
"""On the one hand, China is talking about this as a crisis of a declining fertility rate, and on the other hand, they are cracking down on feminism,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""With those two things in contradiction, how can you convince the next generation of young women who have their own aspirations to go into marriage?""","""一方面，中国将女性权益作为生育率下降危机的因素来谈论，另一方面，政府正在打击女权主义，""董一格在接受电话采访时说。""由于这两种做法相互矛盾，政府怎样才能说服下一代年轻女性结婚生子呢?她们都有自己的抱负。"""
"A shrinking, aging society is far from unique to China, even in Asia, and the effects will unfold over decades. Even so, China's heavy restrictions on family size in past decades mean that the country is confronting these pressures much sooner in its economic takeoff than, say, Japan or South Korea.",人口萎缩、老龄化的社会不只是中国独有的问题。仅就亚洲而言，这个问题的影响也将在几十年的时间里逐渐显现出来。尽管如此，中国过去几十年实行的严格计划生育政策意味着，中国在经济腾飞阶段面临人口压力的时间，比日本或韩国来得更早。
"The resulting economic and population pressures will erode China's strength in coming decades and could encourage its leaders to become more aggressive before they feel their national power has ebbed, says Michael Beckley, an associate professor at Tufts University and co-author of Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China, a new book that lays out this argument.",这个问题带来的经济和人口压力将在未来几十年削弱中国的实力，并可能导致中国领导人在感到国力衰退之前变得更好斗，塔夫茨大学副教授迈克尔·贝克利说道，他在与别人合著的新书《危险地区:与中国的未来冲突》(Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China)中阐述了这个论点。
"""China's proposed demographic reforms are drops in the bucket. They are swamped by the fact that China will lose 5 to 10 million working-age adults and gain 5 to 10 million senior citizens every year for the foreseeable future,"" Professor Beckley said in emailed answers to questions. ""You can't compensate for that kind of demographic crunch simply by raising the retirement age.""","""中国提出的改善人口结构的措施是杯水车薪。使他们不堪承受的一个事实是，在可预见的未来，中国每年将失去500万到1000万工作年龄人口，同时增加500万到1000万老年人口，""贝克利在通过电子邮件回答记者提问时写道。""不能只靠提高退休年龄来弥补这种人口困境。"""
"Other scholars have disputed Professor Beckley's forecast of a demographically led decline in Chinese power. China, they note, could counter population pressures by providing better training for workers, improving their productivity and by increasing innovation and automation across industries.",其他学者对贝克利预测中国实力将受人口因素影响出现衰落的看法提出异议。他们指出，中国能够通过对工人进行更好的培训、提高他们的生产力，以及加强跨行业的创新和自动化，来应对人口压力问题。
"But few disagree that such changes would demand much more spending commitments from Chinese leaders, who also want to invest heavily in military modernization, technological advancement and internal security.",但大家几乎一致认为，这些做法需要中国领导人做出更多的支出承诺，同时他们也希望在军事现代化、技术进步和国内安全方面投入更多资金。
"Mr. Xi has not been blindsided by these challenges. Beijing has unfurled policies to encourage expanded senior care, and promised more social support for women who want to have children. Since citizens have repeatedly expressed public anger over sexual harassment at universities, companies and media outlets, the government has also promised to crack down.",习近平对这些挑战并非毫无准备。中国政府已推出了鼓励扩大养老服务的措施，并承诺为想生育的女性提供更多的社会支持。由于人们对大学、公司和媒体机构的性骚扰多次公开表示愤怒，政府还承诺要予以打击。
"While Mr. Xi has endorsed equality between the sexes and repeated Mao's dictum that ""women hold up half the sky,"" he has also encouraged respect for traditional family roles.","虽然习近平表示支持男女平等，并重提了毛泽东的名言""妇女能顶半边天""，但他也鼓励尊重女性在家庭中的传统作用。"
"""The broad number of women must conscientiously shoulder the burden of caring for the elderly and nurturing the young, educating children, and playing a role in building family virtues,"" he said in 2013.","""广大妇女要自觉肩负起尊老爱幼、教育子女的责任，在家庭美德建设中发挥作用，""他在2013年说。"
"But framing China's population pressures as a matter of attitude issues among young women distracts from the deeper social and economic pressures on them, said Ms. Dong, the professor from the University at Buffalo.",但是，把中国的人口压力表述为年轻女性的态度问题，分散了人们对她们承受的更深层次社会和经济压力的注意力，布法罗大学教授董一格说。
"""It's a political issue, not a question of social engineering,"" she said. ""The blame is put on families and individuals, especially young women who are unwilling to get married, but they don't talk about the role of the state and its policies.""","""这是政治问题，而不是社会工程问题，""她说。""他们把问题归咎于家庭和个人，尤其是不愿结婚生子的年轻女性，而不提国家的作用和政策。"""
"DAVOS, Switzerland China ventured back on to the global stage Tuesday, sending a delegation to the World Economic Forum to assure foreign investors that after three years in which the pandemic cut off their country from the world, life was back to normal.",瑞士达沃斯——周二，中国重返全球舞台，派代表团出席世界经济论坛，并向外国投资者保证，在疫情使中国与世界隔绝三年后，生活已经恢复正常。
"But the Chinese faced a wary audience at the annual event, attesting to both the dramatically changed geopolitical landscape after Russia's war on Ukraine, as well as two data points that highlighted a worrisome shift in China's own fortunes.",但在这个年度盛会上，中国代表团面对的是一群谨慎的观众，证明了俄罗斯对乌克兰发动战争后地缘政治格局发生了巨大变化，而且有两个数据点突显出中国自身命运发生了令人担忧的转变。
"Hours before a senior Chinese official, Liu He, spoke to this elite economic gathering in an Alpine ski resort, the government announced that China's population shrank in 2022 for the first time in 61 years. A short time earlier, it confirmed that economic growth had slowed to 3 percent, well below the trend of the past decade.",就在中国高级官员刘鹤在阿尔卑斯山的一处滑雪胜地向一群经济精英发表讲话的几小时前，中国政府宣布，2022年它的人口61年来首现负增长。不久前，它确认经济增长放缓至3%，远低于过去十年的趋势。
"Against that backdrop, Mr. Liu sought to reassure his audience that China was still a good place to do business. ""If we work hard enough, we are confident that growth will most likely return to its normal trend, and the Chinese economy will make a significant improvement in 2023,"" he said.","在此背景下，刘鹤试图让听众放心，中国仍然是一个做生意的好地方。""我们相信，经过努力，2023年中国经济将实现整体性好转，增速达到正常水平是大概率事件，""他说。"
"Mr. Liu, a well-traveled vice premier who is one of China's most recognizable faces in the West, insisted that the Covid crisis was ""steadying,"" seven weeks after the government abruptly abandoned its policy of quarantines and lockdowns. China had passed the peak of infections, he said, and had sufficient hospital beds, doctors and nurses, and medicine to treat the millions who are sick.","副总理刘鹤游历甚广，也是中国在西方最知名的面孔之一，在中国政府突然放弃隔离和封锁政策七周后，他坚持认为新冠危机正在""稳定下来""。他说，中国已经过了感染高峰期，有足够的病床、医生和护士以及药物来治疗数百万患者。"
"He did not mention the 60,000 fatalities linked to the coronavirus since the lockdowns were lifted, a huge spike in the official death toll that China announced three days ago.",他没有提到自解除封锁以来与新冠有关的6万人死亡，这是中国在三天前宣布的官方数字，与之前公布的数字相比出现了大幅上涨。
"Mr. Liu's mild words and modest tone were in stark contrast to those of his boss, President Xi Jinping, who came to Davos in 2017 to claim the mantle of global economic leadership in a world shaken up by the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States and Britain's vote to leave the European Union.",刘鹤温和的言辞和谦虚的语气与他的老板、国家主席习近平形成鲜明对比。习近平2017年来到达沃斯，在一个因特朗普当选和英国脱欧投票而动荡不安的世界中，宣称自己担负着引领全球经济的重任。
"Since then, the United States and Europe have united to support Ukraine against Russia, leaving the Russians isolated with the Chinese among their few friends. Russia's revanchist campaign has raised questions among Europeans about whether China might have similar designs on Taiwan, and escalated security concerns among the world's democracies.",自那以后，美国和欧洲联合起来支持乌克兰对抗俄罗斯，使俄罗斯人被孤立起来，而中国人是他们为数不多的朋友。俄罗斯的复仇运动在欧洲人中引发了关于中国是否可能对台湾有类似意图的质疑，使得世界民主国家的安全担忧加剧。
"Mr. Liu steered clear of political issues like the war in Ukraine or China's tensions with the Biden administration. But he did say, ""We have to abandon the Cold War mentality,"" echoing a frequent Chinese criticism of the United States for attempting to contain China's influence around the world.","刘鹤避开了乌克兰战争或中国与拜登政府的紧张关系等政治问题。但他表示，""我们必须放弃冷战思维""，这是对中国批评美国试图遏制它在全球影响力的呼应。"
"But it is China's demographics and economic growth that are raising the biggest questions among businesspeople. The decline in population lays bare the country's falling birthrate, a trend that experts said was exacerbated by the pandemic and will threaten its growth over the long term. The 3 percent growth rate, the second weakest since 1976, reflects the stifling effect of the government's Covid policy.",但商界人士当中最大的疑问是中国的人口结构和经济增长。人口下降暴露了该国出生率的下降，专家表示这一趋势因大流行病而加剧，并将威胁中国经济的长期增长。3%的增长率是1976年以来第二低的增长率，从中能看到政府的新冠政策起到的遏制作用。
"""The Chinese are worried, and they should be,"" said Evan S. Medeiros, a professor of Asia studies at Georgetown University. ""The entire international business community is way more negative about China over the long-term. A lot of people are asking, 'Have we reached peak China?'""","""中国人很担心，他们也应该担心，""乔治敦大学亚洲研究教授麦艾文(Evan S. Medeiros)说。""整个国际商界对中国的长期看法要消极得多。很多人都在问，'中国的顶峰已经过去了吗?'"""
"Professor Medeiros, who served as a China adviser in the Obama administration, said, ""For the past 20 years, China has benefited from both geoeconomic gravity and geopolitical momentum, but in the last year it has rapidly lost both.""","曾在奥巴马政府担任中国事务顾问的麦艾文教授表示，""过去20年，中国受益于地缘经济引力和地缘政治动能，但在过去的一年里，它迅速失去了这两样东西。"""
The signposts of China's economic weakness are everywhere: the government announced on Friday that exports fell 9.9 percent in December relative to a year earlier.,中国经济疲软的迹象随处可见:政府周五宣布，12月份出口同比下降9.9%。
"""China has an export slowdown, construction is in crisis, and the local governments are running out of money,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. ""China needs the world: to boost its economy, to accompany the return to more normalcy.""","""中国出口放缓，房地产行业陷入危机，地方政府资金枯竭，""香港浸会大学政治学教授高敬文(Jean-Pierre Cabestan)说。""中国需要世界，以此提振经济，并伴随它回归更多常态。"""
"Mr. Liu laid out a familiar set of economic policies, from upholding the rule of law to pursuing ""innovation-driven development."" He insisted that China was still attractive to foreign investors, who he said were integral to China's plan to achieve the government's goal of ""common prosperity.""","刘鹤提出了一套熟悉的经济政策，从坚持法治到追求""创新驱动发展""。他坚称，中国对外国投资者仍然具有吸引力，他说，外国投资者是中国实现政府""共同繁荣""目标计划不可或缺的一部分。"
"""China's national reality dictates that opening up to the world is a must, not an expediency,"" Mr. Liu said. ""We must open up wider and make it work better. We oppose unilateralism and protectionism.""","""中国的基本国情决定了必须对外开放，""刘鹤说。""不断提高对外开放质量和水平，我们反对单边主义、保护主义。"""
"But China's delegation was a reminder of how the government has sidelined some of its own best-known entrepreneurs as it has reined in powerful technology companies. Jack Ma, a co-founder of the Alibaba Group, used to be one of the biggest celebrities at the World Economic Forum, holding court in a chalet on the outskirts of Davos. Now shunted out of power, Mr. Ma is absent from Davos.",但中国代表团的到来也在提醒着人们，中国政府为了遏制强大的科技公司，是如何排挤本国一些最知名的企业家的。阿里巴巴集团的联合创始人马云曾是世界经济论坛上最知名的人物之一，在达沃斯郊外一座小木屋里成为社交场合的焦点人物。马云现在已失去权力，没有出现在达沃斯。
"Instead, China sent less well-known executives from Ant Group, an affiliate of the Alibaba Group, as well as officials from China Energy Group and China Petrochemical Group. Unlike other countries, notably India and Saudi Arabia, which plastered buildings in Davos with advertisements for foreign investment, China has been low-key, holding meetings at the posh Belvedere Hotel.",取而代之的是，中国派出了阿里巴巴集团旗下蚂蚁集团不那么知名的高管，以及中国能源集团和中国石化集团的官员。与其他国家，尤其是印度和沙特阿拉伯在达沃斯的建筑物上贴满欢迎外国投资的广告不同，中国这次很低调，在豪华的丽城大酒店举行会议。
"After his speech, Mr. Liu, who has a command of English and holds a graduate degree from Harvard, met privately with business executives. Some expected him to be more candid in that session about the challenges China has faced.",演讲结束后，会说英语并拥有哈佛研究生学位的刘鹤私下会见了企业高管。一些人希望他在会晤中能更坦诚地谈论中国面临的挑战。
"Mr. Liu did not meet top American officials in Davos, though he will meet Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Zurich on Wednesday. Martin J. Walsh, the labor secretary who is at the conference, said he welcomed China's return. ""China's in the world economy,"" he said. ""We need to engage with them.""","刘鹤没有在达沃斯会见美国高级官员，但他将于周三在苏黎世会见美国财长珍妮特·耶伦。出席会议的劳工部长马丁·沃尔什说，他欢迎中国回归。""中国在世界经济中，""他说。""我们需要与他们接触。"""
"Though Mr. Liu, 70, has a significant international profile having led trade negotiations with the Trump administration China experts noted that he is not in Mr. Xi's innermost circle. He is also no longer a member of the Chinese government's ruling Politburo, though analysts said he retained the trust of Mr. Xi.",尽管70岁的刘鹤在国际上享有盛誉(曾领导中国与特朗普政府的贸易谈判)，但中国专家指出，他并不在习近平的核心圈子里。他也不再是中国政府执政的政治局成员，不过分析人士表示，习近平保持着对他的信任。
"When he spoke at Davos in 2018, Mr. Liu's speech was among the best attended of the conference. This year, however, about a quarter of the hall emptied before Mr. Liu spoke, after having been packed for a speech by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.",在2018年的达沃斯，刘鹤的演讲是出席会议人数最多的演讲之一。然而今年，在刘鹤发言之前，大厅里约有四分之一的空位，此前欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩的演讲座无虚席。
"The difference in crowd sizes reflected the reshuffled priorities of the West, now focused on exhibiting unity against Russian aggression.",从听众人数的差异可以看到，西方重新调整了优先事项，现在专注于展示团结，反对俄罗斯侵略。
"Ms. von der Leyen, who celebrated that solidarity in her remarks, did not exactly warm up the audience for Mr. Liu. She accused the Chinese government, in its drive to dominate the clean-energy industries of the future, of unfairly subsidizing its companies at the expense of Europe and the United States.",冯德莱恩在她的讲话中赞扬了这种团结，但这种热烈的气氛没有留给中国。她指责中国政府在主导未来清洁能源行业的过程中，以牺牲欧洲和美国的利益为代价，不公平地补贴中国公司。
"""Climate change needs a global approach,"" she said in a chiding tone, ""but it needs to be a fair approach.""","""气候变化需要一种全球性的方法，""她用责备的语气说，""但它需要是一种公平的方法。"""
"The world's most populous country has reached a pivotal moment: China's population has begun to shrink, after a steady, yearslong decline in its birthrate that experts say will be irreversible.",全球人口最多的国家迎来转折点:生育率持续下降多年后，中国人口开始减少，专家称前一个趋势将不可逆转。
"The government said on Tuesday that 9.56 million people were born in China in 2022, while 10.41 million people died. It was the first time deaths had outnumbered births in China since the early 1960s, when the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong's failed economic experiment, led to widespread famine and death.","政府周二表示，2022年中国有956万人出生，1041万人死亡。这是自上世纪60年代初以来，中国死亡人数首次超过出生人数，当时毛泽东失败的经济实验""大跃进""导致了大规模饥荒和死亡。"
"Births were down from 10.6 million in 2021, the sixth straight year that the number had fallen. That decline, coupled with a long-running rise in life expectancy, is thrusting China into a demographic crisis that will have consequences in this century, not just for China and its economy but for the world, experts said.",2022年出生人数低于2021年的1060万，连续第六年下降。专家表示，这一数字的下降，加上预期寿命的长期上升，正将中国推入一场人口危机，这将在本世纪对中国及其经济，以及全世界产生影响。
"""In the long run, we are going to see a China the world has never seen,"" said Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Irvine who specializes in demographics in China.","""从长远来看，我们将看到一个世界从未见过的中国，""加州大学尔湾分校专门研究中国人口统计学的社会学教授王丰表示。"
"""It will no longer be the young, vibrant, growing population. We will start to appreciate China, in terms of its population, as an old and shrinking population.""","""中国将不再拥有年轻有活力且不断增长的人口。我们将认识到，中国是一个老龄化和人口萎缩的国家。"""
"The news comes at a challenging time for the government in Beijing, which is dealing with the fallout from the sudden reversal last month of its zero-tolerance policy toward Covid.","这一消息公布之际，中国政府正处于紧张时期，因为要应对上个月突然逆转""清零""政策所带来的后果。"
"Over the last four decades, China has emerged as an economic powerhouse and the world's factory floor. That transformation led to an increase in life expectancy that contributed to its current situation more people getting older while fewer babies are born. By 2035, 400 million people in China are expected to be over 60, accounting for nearly a third of its population.",中国在过去40年里成为经济大国和世界工厂。这一转型让预期寿命迎来增长，这加剧了目前的情况——越来越多人老去，而出生的婴儿却越来越少。到2035年，中国60岁以上人口预计将达4亿，占总人口的近三分之一。
That trend is hastening another worrying event: the day when China will not have enough people of working age to fuel the high-speed growth that made it an engine of the global economy. Labor shortages will also reduce tax revenue and contributions to a pension system that is already under enormous pressure.,这样的趋势正在加速另一个令人担忧的情况:总有一天，中国将没有足够的适龄劳动力来推动经济高速增长，而这种增长曾使中国成为全球经济的引擎。劳动力短缺还将导致税收减少，让本已压力巨大的养老金体系更加捉襟见肘。
"The result, some experts have argued, could have implications for the global order, with India's population poised to outgrow China's later this year, according to a recent estimate from the United Nations.",有专家认为，这一结果可能对全球秩序产生影响。根据联合国最近的预测，印度的人口增长将在今年晚些时候超过中国。
"This moment was not unexpected. Chinese officials last year conceded that the country was on the verge of a population decline that would likely begin before 2025. But it came sooner than demographers, statisticians and China's ruling Communist Party had anticipated.",这一转折点并非出乎意料。中国官员去年承认，该国即将迎来人口下降，可能会从2025年开始。但它来得比人口学家、统计人员和执政的中共预期的还要快。
"Officials have taken steps to try to slow the decline in births. In 2016, they relaxed the one-child policy that had been in place for 35 years, allowing families to have two children. In 2021, they raised the limit to three. Since then, Beijing has offered a range of incentives to couples and small families to encourage them to have children, including cash handouts, tax cuts and even property concessions.","官员已采取措施试图减缓生育率的下滑。2016年，他们放宽了已实施35年的独生子女政策，允许家庭生育""二孩""。2021年，他们将限制放宽到""三孩""。自那以后，中国为夫妻和小家庭颁布了一系列鼓励生育的激励措施，包括现金补贴、减税，甚至还有购房优惠。"
"Xi Jinping, China's top leader, recently made the issue a priority, pledging ""a national policy system to boost birthrates."" But in reality, experts said, China's plunging birth figures reveal an irreversible trend.","最近，中国最高领导人习近平将这一问题列为优先事项，承诺""建立生育支持政策体系""。但专家指出，中国生育率的急剧下降实际上是不可逆转的趋势。"
"Together with Japan and South Korea, China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, below what demographers call the fertility replacement rate required for a population to grow. That figure would require every couple, on average, to have two children.",与日本韩国一样，中国是全球生育率最低的国家之一，低于人口学家所谓的生育更替率，这是实现人口增长的必要条件。该数字需要每对夫妇平均生育两个孩子。
"So far, the government's measures have failed to change the underlying fact that many young Chinese people simply do not want children. They often cite the increasingly high cost of raising them, especially with the economy in a precarious state.",到目前为止，政府的措施并没有改变许多年轻中国人根本不想要孩子的基本现实。他们经常指出，抚养孩子的成本越来越高，特别是在经济状况不稳定的情况下。
"Rachel Zhang, a 33-year-old photographer in Beijing, decided before she married her husband that they would not have children. Sometimes, elders in the family nag them about having a baby.",33岁的北京摄影师蕾切尔·张(音)在结婚之前就与丈夫决定不要孩子。家中长辈有时会催促他们生育。
"""I am firm about this,"" Ms. Zhang said. ""I have never had the desire to have children all along."" The rising costs of raising a child and finding an apartment in good school district have hardened her resolve.","""我很坚定，""蕾切尔·张说。""从小到大一直没有要小朋友的意愿。""养育成本和在好学区找房子的开销不断上升，这都坚定了她的决心。"
"Other factors have contributed to such reluctance to have more children, including the burden that many younger adults face in taking care of aging parents and grandparents.",其他因素也导致了这种不愿生养更多孩子的心态，比如许多年轻人都面临给父母和祖父母养老的负担。
"China's strict ""zero Covid"" policy nearly three years of mass testing, quarantines and lockdowns, resulting in some families being separated for long periods of time may have led even more people to decide against having children.","中国严格的""清零""政策——近三年的大规模检测、隔离和封锁，导致一些家庭长期分离——可能导致更多人拒绝生育。"
"Luna Zhu, 28, and her husband have parents who are willing to take care of their grandchildren. And she works for a state-owned enterprise that provides a good maternity leave package. But Ms. Zhu, who got married five years ago, is not interested.",28岁的卢娜·朱(音)的父母与丈夫的父母都愿意照顾孙辈。她在一家产假福利优越的国企上班。但已经结婚五年的卢娜·朱对生孩子不感兴趣。
"""Especially the past three years of the epidemic, I feel that many things are so hard,"" Ms. Zhu said.","""尤其是疫情这三年，感觉好多事情都太不容易了，""她说。"
"After China's abrupt reversal of ""zero Covid"" restrictions, the nation's vast machinery of virus surveillance and testing collapsed, even as infections and deaths surged. Now, the authorities face another problem: Angry pandemic-control workers demanding wages and jobs.","中国突然取消""清零""限制后，国内庞大的病毒追踪和检测行业崩溃了，与此同时，感染病毒和死于新冠的人数激增。当局现在面临着又一个问题:从事与流行病疾控有关的工作人员在愤怒地要求工资和工作。"
"In the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, hundreds of workers locked in a pay dispute with a Covid test kit manufacturer hurled objects at police officers in riot gear, who held up shields as they retreated. Standing on stocks of inventory, protesters kicked and tossed boxes of rapid antigen tests on to the ground, sending thousands of tests spilling.",在中国重庆，数百名工人与一家新冠检测试剂盒制造商发生了工资纠纷，工人们向身穿防暴服的警察扔东西，警察则举着盾牌慢慢后退。抗议者站在仓库的货箱上，将装有快速抗原检测试剂盒的纸箱往地下踢，数千个检测盒撒了一地。
"In the eastern city of Hangzhou, witnesses said several workers climbed on the roof of a test kit factory and threatened to jump to protest unpaid furloughs. And at a separate test manufacturing plant in the city, workers protested for days over a wage dispute.",在杭州，目击者称，几名工人爬上一家检测盒制造厂的屋顶，抗议因发不出工资被迫提前放假，还有人威胁要跳楼。在杭州的另一家检测试剂盒制造厂，工人们因工资纠纷已经抗议了好几天。
"The unrest this month highlights a little-noticed aspect of the social and economic fallout from China's ""zero Covid"" policy U-turn. Mass testing was a cornerstone of China's strategy of isolating the virus before it could spread. But Covid testing of any sort is no longer in high demand. Companies that manufactured test kits and analyzed results in a lab are seeing their revenues plummet, leading to layoffs and pay cuts for their workers. One report suggested that mass testing in large cities accounted for about 1.3 percent of China's economic output.","本月的动荡凸显了中国""清零""政策180度大转弯给社会和经济带来的一个尚未引起太多注意的影响。大规模核酸检测曾是中国在新冠病毒能广泛传播之前将其控制住的战略基石。但对各种新冠检测方法的需求都已减少。制造检测试剂盒，以及拥有分析检测结果实验室的公司正在看到自己的收入直线下降，导致公司裁员、给仍在岗的工人减薪。有报告显示，大城市的全员核酸检测曾为中国经济提供了约1.3%的产值。"
"The consequence has been a new source of turmoil that challenges the ruling Communist Party's efforts to maintain stability amid high youth unemployment, a flagging economy and an explosion of Covid across the country. China said on Saturday that it had recorded nearly 60,000 fatalities linked to the coronavirus in the month since it lifted ""zero Covid,"" though experts said the actual death toll was likely much higher.","这些后果构成了新的动荡源头，挑战中共的维稳努力。中共正面临年轻人失业率居高不下、经济疲软、新冠疫情在国内海啸式暴发的情况。中国上周六称，在取消""清零""政策后的一个月里，已有近6万人死于与新冠病毒有关的疾病。但专家们说，实际死亡人数可能高得多。"
"The New York Times visited three Covid test making factories in Hangzhou where workers and residents confirmed that there had been labor protests in recent days. At one plant operated by a firm called Xinyue Biotech, a fire truck, an ambulance and a police van could be seen in the factory yard on Wednesday responding to a worker who had climbed on to the fifth-floor roof and threatened to jump to protest unpaid wages. The shuttered plant had been the scene of days of demonstrations, witnesses near the factory said.",《纽约时报》记者去了杭州三家生产新冠病毒检测盒的工厂，那里的工人和居民证实，最近几天发生了劳工抗议活动。上周三，杭州新跃生物科技有限公司经营的一家工厂里曾出现了一辆消防车、一辆救护车和一辆警车，一名抗议欠发工资的工人爬上了五层楼的屋顶，威胁要跳楼，这些车辆被派来处理情况。工厂附近的目击者说，几天来都有人在这家已经停工的工厂示威。
"The Times also examined videos that have circulated on social media of protests in Hangzhou as well as Chongqing, where workers confronted the police in large numbers.",时报还查看了社交媒体上流传的杭州抗议视频，以及在重庆拍摄的大量工人与警察对峙的抗议画面。
,
"The disputes in Chongqing and Hangzhou could portend more unrest to come. Many among China's armies of ""big whites,"" low-level government workers charged with enforcing Covid restrictions and named after their signature white hazmat suits, have been let go, muddying an already volatile labor market.","重庆和杭州的对峙也许预示着更多动荡的到来。中国曾有一支执行""清零""政策的大军，由政府基层工作人员组成，他们因穿着标志性的白色防护服被人称为""大白""。这支""大白""队伍中已有许多人被解雇，给本已动荡的劳动力市场添了更多乱子。"
"Factories across China are still strapped for cash amid the broader slowdown. Workers have next to no recourse to resolve their grievances other than to lash out, said Li Qiang, founder and executive director of China Labor Watch, a New York-based Chinese labor rights group.",在整体经济放缓的情况下，中国各地的工厂都面临着资金紧张问题。总部设在纽约的中国劳工权益组织中国劳工观察的创办者和执行主任李强说，工人除了发泄外，几乎没有其他消解他们不满的办法。
"""These protests have been very violent because the channels to defend workers' rights are very limited, while the trust toward the government and laws is low,"" Mr. Li said. ""It demonstrates that if a company ignores workers rights, especially the most vulnerable temporary workers, it will face serious consequences.""","""这些抗议活动一直都很暴力，因为捍卫工人权益的渠道非常有限，人们对政府和法律的信任度很低，""李强说。""如果一家公司忽视工人的权益，尤其是最脆弱的临时工的权益，工人们只能通过抗议来让公司面临严重后果。"""
"In Chongqing, protesters at a test kit manufacturer chanted ""Pay me back"" as they faced off with lines of police on Jan. 7. It was not immediately clear what sparked the dispute between workers and the test kit manufacturer, Zybio. Videos posted on social media leading up to the protests warned of labor agencies in the area exploiting job seekers by inflating how much work Covid test manufacturers were offering and how much they would pay.","重庆一家检测试剂盒制造商的抗议者今年1月7日与警察对峙时高喊""还钱""。目前尚不清楚工人与检测试剂盒制造商中元汇吉生物技术发生争执的原因。抗议活动发生前，社交媒体上发出的视频曾警告，当地的劳工介绍部门夸大了核酸采样盒制造商提供的工作时间和支付的工资，误导了求职者。"
"The Times verified the location of the Zybio protest videos by matching buildings in videos with online photos and satellite images of the industrial park. One clip showed protesters throwing plastic containers, stools and a traffic cone at police equipped with riot gear. The company did not respond to requests for comment, and several protesters contacted by The Times declined to be interviewed.",时报通过将中元汇吉抗议视频里的建筑物与网上的工业园区照片和卫星图像进行比对，证实了抗议视频拍摄的地点。一段视频显示，抗议者向配备了防暴装备的警察投掷塑料容器、凳子和交通锥。中元汇吉没有回复记者的置评请求，时报联系到的几名抗议者拒绝接受采访。
,
"In Hangzhou, protests flared after workers at the Acon Biotech plant were told at the start of this month they would be furloughed for two weeks because the company's revenues had dwindled since ""zero Covid"" measures were dropped.","杭州艾康生物的工人本月初被告知，他们将提前两周放假，因为自从取消""清零""政策以来，公司的收入大为减少。这之后爆发了抗议活动。"
"One employee who participated in the protests, who agreed to speak only if not quoted by name given the political sensitivity of labor unrest, said workers were enraged by the furlough because it meant they could not earn money before the Lunar New Year, which starts this weekend.",一名参加了抗议活动的员工说，工人们对提前放假感到愤怒，因为这意味着他们无法在这个周末开始的春节假期前赚到钱。考虑到劳工骚乱的政治敏感性，这名员工要求匿名。
"At one point, distraught employees threatened to jump off the roof of a company building. The workers were finally given 3,000 yuan, or roughly $445, apiece a week ago, and the bulk of the work force then left for the holiday.",在某个时刻，一名心烦意乱的员工威胁要从公司大楼的屋顶跳下来。工人们终于在一周前每人拿到了3000元的工资，然后大部分员工已回家过年去了。
"Many Chinese testing companies had been amassing fortunes during nearly three years of stringent Covid containment measures. But the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant made containing the virus all but impossible, and China abandoned the strategy in early December.","严格执行了近三年的""清零""政策让中国许多与病毒检测有关的公司赚了大钱。但传染性很强的奥密克戎变异株的出现让遏制病毒变得几乎不可能，中国已在去年12月初放弃了""清零""政策。"
"Even without Omicron, China's strategy of mass testing was proving financially unsustainable. Many local governments already under significant financial pressure from the slowdown and a dearth of land sales for real estate development struggled to pay for the millions of free swabs that residents were ordered to take virtually every day.",即使没有奥密克戎变异株的出现，中国大规模核酸检测的做法也已被证明在财政上不可持续。许多地方政府已因经济放缓以及卖地收入减少而承受着巨大的财政压力，很难继续支付要求居民几乎每天做核酸所需的几百万个免费拭子的费用。
"To fund testing and other pandemic controls, money was diverted from public projects in some provinces, while cities cut bonuses for officials and imposed pay cuts on civil servants. Several provinces and municipalities, including Guizhou in China's southwest, began charging for the tests.",为了支付全员核酸检测和其他遏制新冠病毒大流行措施的费用，一些省份从公共项目挪用资金，有些城市则取消了官员的奖金、降低公务员的工资。包括贵州在内的几个省和城市已开始对核酸检测收费。
"Lab testing firms that earlier reaped huge windfalls began reporting that governments were late on payments, leaving them exposed to bad debt. Among them was Dian Diagnostics, a large testing company in Hangzhou, which reported in October that the amount of money it was owed had surged by nearly 80 percent compared to a year before.",此前在做病毒检测上发了巨额横财的公司实验室已开始报称，政府拖欠付款让它们面临坏账风险。这些公司包括杭州的大型检测企业迪安诊断，它在去年10月的财报中称，公司尚未收到的欠款金额与一年前相比激增了近80%。
"Shenzhen Hezi Gene Tech, another fast-growing testing firm, opened six new labs across China in October only to shutter half of them in the last few weeks. It was unclear if the closures were spurred by debt or a lack of business. The company did not respond to a request for comment.",另一家快速发展的检测公司深圳核子基因科技曾在去年10 月在中国开设了六个新实验室，但已在过去几周里关闭了其中的一半。尚不清楚实验室关门是由于债务问题还是缺乏业务。核子基因没有回复记者的置评请求。
"""The whole industry has been hit particularly hard with the elimination of mandatory testing in the country. The demand is no longer there,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, who argued that ""zero Covid"" had been partly prolonged because it served so many business interests.","""随着中国取消强制性核酸检测，整个行业已受到了尤其严重的打击。不再有需求，""美国外交关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠说，他认为""清零""政策之所以延长的部分原因是，该政策为许多企业带来了利益。"
"""They made a lot of money working for the government implementing 'zero Covid,'"" Mr. Huang said of labs and test manufacturers.","""它们为政府的'清零'政策工作，赚了很多钱，""黄严忠谈到实验室和检测试剂制造商时说。"
"Just how disruptive the collapse of testing and all the employment associated with Covid controls will be to China's economy remains to be seen. The lifting of ""zero Covid"" will remove constraints on economic activity, and that could spur growth that would overshadow the loss of Covid-related businesses, said Taylor Loeb, a senior economic analyst for Trivium China, a consulting firm.","核酸检测行业的崩溃以及与""清零""政策相关的就业消失会给中国经济造成多大破坏还有待观察。咨询公司策伟的高级经济分析师泰勒·勒布说，取消""清零""政策将解除对经济活动的限制，有可能刺激增长，弥补与""清零""相关业务的损失。"
"""A lot of these jobs were never going to be long-term, stable employment opportunities,"" Mr. Loeb said.","""与防疫有关的许多工作岗位从来都不会成为长期、稳定的就业机会，""勒布说。"
"To many migrant workers, the timing could not be worse. Employees are usually eyeing bonuses and counting their savings in the weeks leading up to Lunar New Year so that they can travel home for the holiday, settle debts and lavish their family and friends with gifts.",对许多外来务工人员来说，这个时候失去与防疫有关的工作再糟糕不过了。他们通常会在春节前的几周里盼着将要得到的奖金，数着他们的存款，为回家过年所需的路费，以及偿还债务、花大钱给家人和朋友买礼物做准备。
"In Hangzhou, a tense standoff between the police and hundreds of workers at an Alltest Biotech factory devolved into a shoving match Jan. 9, a video showed. Dozens of them were taken away by the police, several eyewitnesses said in interviews.",一段视频显示，今年1月9日，在杭州奥泰生物的一家工厂，警方与数百名工人的紧张对峙演变成了一场推搡。几名目击者在接受采访时说，警方将数十人带走。
,
"Workers hired by a temporary employment agency on Alltest's behalf had complained they were being paid less than permanent workers, according to an employee interviewed at the factory gate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. An employee who answered a phone at Alltest said operations had returned to normal, but declined to provide a name or discuss the unrest.",记者在工厂门口采访到的一名员工说，一家临时职业介绍所替奥泰雇来的工人抱怨，发给他们的工资比正式员工的低。由于这件事的敏感性，该员工要求不具名。一名接听电话的奥泰员工说，工厂已恢复正常运行，但拒绝透露姓名或讨论骚乱的问题。
"HONG KONG Yuan-tsung Chen, an author, leaned forward in an oversize velvet chair to tell the story of the man so hungry that he ate himself.",香港——作家陈元珍坐在一个硕大的天鹅绒椅上，倾身讲述了一个男子饿到竟然吃自己的故事。
"Once, that tale had seemed unbelievable to her. ""I thought that was an exaggeration,"" she said. But living in a village during the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong's calamitous attempt to catapult China into communist plenty in the late 1950s, changed her view on what extreme hunger could drive people to actually do.","以前，这个故事对她来说似乎难以置信。""我觉得那是一种夸张，""她说。但大跃进期间在中国农村的生活经历，改变了她对极端饥饿会迫使人们真的干下什么事情的看法。大跃进是毛泽东在20世纪50年代末将中国快速推入共产主义富裕阶段的灾难性尝试。"
"""It wasn't anyone's exaggeration, it was as true as real life, but nobody would say it,"" Ms. Chen said, recalling the desperation and starvation caused by Mao's experiment. Historians estimate that up to 45 million people died over the course of five years.","""这不是某个人的夸张故事，而是与现实生活一样真实的情况，但没有人会这样说，""陈元珍回忆起毛泽东的大跃进带来的绝望和饥饿时说。历史学家估计有多达4500万人在五年里死亡。"
"Now, sitting at a restaurant in one of Hong Kong's most opulent hotels, Ms. Chen, 93, says she has a warning for the world.",现在，坐在香港一家最豪华酒店的餐厅里，93岁的陈元珍说她想对全世界发出警告。
"Having lived through one of the most tumultuous periods in China's recent history, Ms. Chen disputes the Communist Party's sanitized version of its past and worries it has allowed it to continue making mistakes with global consequences.",经历过中国近代史上一些最动荡年代的陈元珍反对中共净化历史的做法，担心这将使其继续犯下造成全球影响的错误。
"Her voice drops, barely audible among the din of cutlery and diners in the restaurant: ""When you do things in the spirit of Mao, that scares me,"" she says, referring to China's top leader, Xi Jinping.","她的声音在餐具和用餐者的嘈杂声中低到几乎听不见的程度。她说，""以毛的那种方式做事让我害怕""，她指的是中国最高领导人习近平。"
"Her books, she said, are meant to add ""blood and flesh"" to the official party account and help readers empathize with the Chinese people who have suffered under an authoritarian system. But her efforts have raised questions about whose voice matters when it comes to narrating Chinese history.","她说，她的书是为了给中共的官方叙事添加""血肉""，帮助读者对专制制度下受苦受难的中国人民产生共鸣。但她的努力已引发了在讲述中国历史时谁的声音最重要的问题。"
Ms. Chen is part of the increasingly small group of people still alive who endured the worst of Mao's excesses. She says she wants to set the record straight. But her critics mostly men have raised doubts about the details of her recollections and accused her of being a fabulist.,陈元珍是经历过毛泽东最恶劣暴行的仍然在世者之一，这些人已越来越少。她说，她要将那段历史真实地记录下来。但她的批评者——主要是男性——对她回忆的细节提出了质疑，还有人指责她捏造事实。
She welcomes the interrogation.,她对这种审视表示欢迎。
"Her recent memoir, ""The Secret Listener: An Ingenue in Mao's Court,"" was published last year. The book is the culmination of decades of writing and rewriting her personal history. She hopes it will help bring closer attention to places such as Hong Kong, her adopted home, where Chinese history is being rewritten once again, this time under Mr. Xi.",她最近的英文回忆录《秘密倾听者:毛泽东宫廷中的天真少女》(The Secret Listener: An Ingenue in Mao's Court)于去年出版。这本书是她几十年撰写和重写个人历史的结果。她希望该书会有助于引起人们对香港等地更密切的关注，香港是她的第二故乡，在习近平的领导下，中国历史在那里正再次被改写。
"""I know the past fairly well and I can see something is coming,"" she said.","""我相当了解过去，我能看到一些即将发生的事情，""她说。"
Events in Hong Kong gave Ms. Chen the resolve to publish her recent memoir. They include the kidnappings in 2015 of several booksellers who sold salacious stories about China's top leader and the enormous pro-democracy protests in 2019.,香港发生的事情让陈元珍下决心出版她最近的回忆录。这些事情包括2015年几名曾经销售涉及中国最高领导人的八卦书籍的书商被绑架到大陆，以及香港2019年发生的大规模民主抗议活动。
The rewriting of middle and high school textbooks in mainland China and Hong Kong sharpened her sense of purpose.,中国大陆和香港改写初中、高中教科书的做法，让她的目标感变得更加清晰。
"Under Mr. Xi, China enforced a sweeping crackdown on Hong Kong that included an all-encompassing national security law put in place in 2020. Since then, the city has fallen under a cloak of silence that Ms. Chen says she recognizes. ""My current situation looks uncannily like the one I found myself in more than 60 years ago.""","在习近平的领导下，中央政府对香港进行了全面镇压，包括在2020年实施涉及范围广泛的港区国安法。那之后，香港一直处于一种沉默气氛中，陈元珍说，她熟悉这种气氛。""香港现在的情况与我60多年前发现自己所处的非常相似。"""
"Ms. Chen was a child of privilege who grew up in metropolitan Shanghai in the 1930s. She came of age in the early days of the People's Republic of China, after Mao and the Communist Party took over in 1949. In 1958, she married Jack Chen, a Communist journalist who came from a prominent Chinese-Trinidadian family and had connections with top party officials such as Zhou Enlai.",陈元珍出生于一个生活优渥的家庭，20世纪30年代在大都市上海长大，在毛泽东和共产党1949年夺取政权成立了中华人民共和国之初步入成年。1958年，她与中共记者陈依范结婚，陈依范出生于特立尼达一个有名的华侨家庭，与周恩来等中共高官有交往。
"Ms. Chen worked as a clerical assistant in Beijing's Central Film Bureau, but she longed to write. Writing eventually became what jolted her out of her cautious optimism for the party and led to a nearly two-decade struggle to get out of China.",解放后，陈元珍从上海来到北京在中央电影局做文职工作，但她渴望写作。写作最终让她改变了对中共的谨慎乐观看法，导致她一家为离开中国大陆进行了近二十年的努力。
"In 1955, not long after Ms. Chen joined the Central Film Bureau, Hu Feng, a well-known Chinese Marxist writer, was detained for penning a report arguing that literature should allow for greater expressiveness.",1955年，陈元珍进入中央电影局后不久，中国著名的马克思主义批评家胡风因写了一篇主张应该让文学有更多表现力的文章后成为打击目标。
"His words triggered a purge that rippled through Ms. Chen's circle of friends and colleagues, some of whom were accused of being part of Mr. Hu's ""counterrevolutionary clique.""","批判胡风的运动导致陈元珍的朋友和同事圈子中许多人遭到清洗，其中一些人被指控为""胡风反革命集团""成员。"
"Then, unexpectedly, Mao began to welcome criticism of the party, urging a ""hundred flowers to bloom,"" a phrase meant to encourage people to speak up and criticize the party's shortcomings.","那之后，毛泽东出人意料地欢迎大家批评中共，提出了""百花齐放""的说法，意思是鼓励人们勇敢发表批评中共缺点的声音。"
"Feeling inspired, Ms. Chen began to write. But before she had a chance to finish, Mao started rounding up the critics who had dared to speak out, accusing them of producing ""poisonous weeds"" instead of ""fragrant flowers.""","陈元珍觉得受到了启发，开始写作。但还没写完，毛泽东就开始揪出那些敢于发声批评的人，指责他们写的东西是""毒草""，而不是""香花""。"
"Critics were executed or sent to labor camps for re-education. Petrified that her manuscript would reveal ""poisonous"" thoughts, Ms. Chen lit a match to it. ""I scattered that manuscript like ashes,"" she said.","批评中共的人被关进监狱或送往劳改农场接受再教育。害怕写的东西会暴露出自己的""有毒""思想，陈元珍把手稿付之一炬。""我的那份手稿早已灰飞烟灭，""她说。"
The act would come back to haunt her.,烧掉的稿子后来一直让她不能忘怀。
"By burning the first draft of her own story, Ms. Chen participated in what Orville Schell, a China scholar, has referred to as the destruction of historical memory. Some academics have questioned whether Ms. Chen's accounts can be trusted, or if she has exaggerated her access to party officials such as Zhou Yang, who, she said in her memoir, asked her for advice on how to handle Mr. Hu's case.","陈元珍把自己故事的初稿烧掉，也就破坏了""历史记忆""(研究中国问题的学者夏伟[Orville Schell]的说法)。一些学者对陈元珍的记忆是否可靠表示怀疑，或怀疑她对与周扬等党内官员关系的描述是否有所夸大，她在回忆录中说，周扬曾就如何处理胡风的问题向她征求意见。"
"""This is one of the perils of the Chinese Communist Party's destruction of historical memory,"" said Mr. Schell, the Arthur Ross Director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. Like others, Ms. Chen, he said, had to write her memoir ""sort of stripped of all of her resources except her memory.""","""这是中共破坏历史记忆的危险之一，""在亚洲协会美中关系中心担任亚瑟·罗斯冠名主任的夏伟说。他说，陈元珍和其他人一样，不得不""在差不多是除了自己的记忆之外几乎没有其他资料""的情况下写回忆录。"
"Many of the scenes in Ms. Chen's memoir come from books that she and her husband wrote years ago, as well as earlier manuscripts. Recently, in her small but sunny apartment on the south side of Hong Kong Island, she stood over books and old manuscripts piled atop a dining table.",陈元珍回忆录中的许多情节来自她和丈夫多年前的著书和更早的手稿。最近，在港岛南侧一个阳光明媚的小公寓里，她站在堆满了书籍和旧手稿的桌子前。
"She held up yellowing copies of books by her husband, like ""A Year in Upper Felicity: Life in a Chinese Village During the Cultural Revolution,"" and ""Inside the Cultural Revolution,"" about the period of political tumult when Mao, fearing that his revolution was being corrupted by compromise, unleashed young Red Guards to persecute officials, academics and others.",她拿起丈夫写的英文书，比如已经泛黄的《上乐村的一年:文革期间的中国乡村生活》(A Year in Upper Felicity: Life in a Chinese Village During the Cultural Revolution)和《亲历文革》(Inside the Cultural Revolution)，内容都是关于毛泽东领导发动的文化大革命这一政治动荡时期。毛泽东担心自己的革命事业无法为继，发动年轻的红卫兵迫害党内官员、学者和其他人。
"She also turned to manuscripts she wrote when she and her husband settled at Cornell University after finally fleeing China in 1971. ""Cold Wind"" is about her family's experience during the Cultural Revolution. ""The Dragon's Village"" was the basis for the chapters about the Great Leap Forward in her memoir.",她还参考了自己的作品手稿，那是她在与丈夫定居康纳尔大学后写的，这对夫妇于1971年终于逃离了中国。《寒风》(Cold Wind)讲述了她家人在文化大革命中的遭遇。 《龙村》(The Dragon's Village)是她基于大跃进回忆的自传体小说。
"""This is why I said I didn't depend on my memory, and I have my own notes because after we came out, I took notes,"" she said, holding a brown envelope with one of her manuscripts.","""这就是我说我不靠记忆的原因，我有自己的笔记，因为我们出国后我写了笔记，""她拿着一个装着手稿的棕色大信封说。"
"""The Dragon's Village,"" Ms. Chen's first book, was published in 1980. Though it is a work of fiction, it is based on her experiences living in a village in 1960 during the Great Leap Forward.",陈元珍的第一本书《龙村》是1980年出版的，虽然这是部虚构作品，但是根据她在大跃进后的1960年在一个村庄的生活经历写成的。
"Fearing she might attract suspicion during the anti-Hu purge, Ms. Chen volunteered to go to the countryside to help with land reform. There, she discovered that Mao's earlier experiment with collectivization had been a disaster. Crops had been destroyed, wooded areas replaced with tree stumps. The land, she wrote, was like ""a ruined cemetery where human remains had been dug up and exposed.""","由于担心自己会在打击胡风的清洗中受怀疑，陈元珍主动要求下乡工作。她在那里发现毛泽东早期的集体化实验是一场灾难。庄稼被毁，整山的树被砍光。她写道，满地就像是""被毁的墓地，被挖出来的人类遗骸暴露在外""。"
"It was clear to her that any success in land reform was an illusion when she met emaciated villagers with tales of family members who had died of starvation. Yet instead of reporting the true numbers of depleted crops, she and other villagers created a Potemkin wheat field for senior Party members in order to keep up the mirage of a bumper harvest.",她遇到骨瘦如柴的村民，听他们讲述家人饿死的情况后，任何所谓土地改革的成功在她看来都是一种幻觉。然而，她和当地村民并没有上报粮食减产的真实数字，而是为来视察的中共上层官员们制造了一个特大丰收的假象。
"Scenes like these in ""The Secret Listener,"" her latest book, read at times like a film script, with detailed dialogue between characters, a method she says she used to make the overall story more compelling.",这些出现在她的新书《秘密倾听者》中的情景，有时读起来像是电影剧本，里面的人物之间有详细的对话，她说，之所以采用这种写法，是为了让故事更加引人入胜。
"In the late 1960s, the fury of vigilante Red Guard youth prompted Ms. Chen and her husband to send their young son away to live with his grandmother in Shanghai. Ms. Chen's husband was at one point punished for being elite, given a new job cleaning toilets and banished to a slum. He would die in 1995, two decades after the family finally escaped.",20世纪60年代后期，红卫兵无法无天的暴力做法促使陈元珍和丈夫将年幼的儿子送到上海与外祖母一起生活。陈元珍的丈夫一度因为精英身份而受到惩罚，被分配去打扫厕所，并搬进简陋的住所。在全家终于离开中国二十多年后，他于1995年去世。
"In her memoir's nail-biting ending, Ms. Chen describes pursuing increasingly desperate measures to acquire the exit visa she and her husband needed to leave China, with their lives under threat as they became entangled in ever bigger political struggles.",在陈元珍回忆录的结尾，她用令人紧张的手法描述了她和丈夫为获得离开中国所需的出境许可而采取的越来越不惜冒险的做法，他们当时生活在被卷入越来越大的政治斗争的危险之下。
"One by one, those in the government who could guarantee their escape were targeted by radical officials.",政府中那些能确保他们出国的人一个接一个地成为革命派的打击对象。
"Chen Yi was a civil servant who had been tasked with helping the couple escape. One day, Ms. Chen looked up to see giant posters with his name on them: ""Bash in Chen Yi's Head and Boil Him in Oil!""","陈一(音)是曾负责帮助陈家人办理出境申请的政府官员。有一天，陈元珍突然看到点了这个官员名字的大字报，上面还有""砸烂狗头!""、""油炸黑帮分子!""等标语。"
"In the end, she and her husband were granted visas because of her husband's friendship with Zhou Enlai. The visas were issued with the understanding Mr. Chen would promote communism abroad.",最后，由于陈依范与周恩来有过交往，她的家人终于拿到了出境许可，允许他们出国的条件是陈依范去国外宣传共产主义。
"Today, Ms. Chen's voice has been drowned out by party historians who gloss over events like the Great Leap Forward and dismiss the estimates of tens of millions of dead as ""historical nihilism"" intended to undermine the party.","今天，陈元珍的声音早已被中共历史学家们的声音所掩盖，他们对大跃进等运动加以粉饰，把大跃进导致数千万人死亡的估计说成是旨在破坏中共的""历史虚无主义""。"
"""They say history is on their side and that means they are right,"" Ms. Chen said about China's Communist Party.","""他们说历史在他们一边，意味着他们正确，""陈元珍提到中共时说。"
"But, she added, ""If you know the past and the way they did things then, you can understand better what is happening now.""","她还说，""但如果人们了解过去、知道他们过去做过的事情，就能对现在发生的事情有更好的了解。"""
"China said on Saturday that it had recorded nearly 60,000 fatalities linked to the coronavirus in the month since the country lifted its strict ""zero Covid"" policy, accelerating an outbreak that is believed to have infected millions of people. The disclosure was the first time China has provided an official measure of the Covid wave now sweeping the country, and represents a huge spike in the official death toll.","自中国取消严格的""清零""政策以来，疫情加速蔓延，据信已有数以百万计的民众感染，该国周六表示，政策取消的一个月内已有近6万人死于新冠。这是中国首次就目前席卷全国的新冠疫情提供官方数字，官方死亡人数大幅飙升。"
"Until Saturday, China had reported a total of just 5,241 Covid deaths since the pandemic began in the city of Wuhan in late 2019. That measure was narrowly defined as deaths from pneumonia or respiratory failure caused by Covid. The new figure released Saturday included those who had Covid, but also died from other underlying illnesses.",自2019年底大流行从武汉市开始以来，在上周六之前，中国共报告了5241例新冠死亡病例。该衡量标准被严格限定为因新冠引起的肺炎或呼吸衰竭导致的死亡。周六发布的新数据包括那些感染了新冠病毒且死于其他基础疾病的人。
"China has faced mounting criticism from other countries and from the World Health Organization for not providing reliable data about the extent of its Covid outbreak and about the number of deaths across the country despite widespread scenes of overflowing hospitals, morgues and funeral homes in recent weeks.",尽管近几周医院、太平间和殡仪馆不堪重负，但中国没有提供疫情的暴发程度和全国死亡人数的可靠数据，为此面临来自其他国家和世界卫生组织的越来越多的批评。
"Before the announcement, China said that only 37 people had died of Covid since Dec. 7, the day it ended its ""zero Covid"" policy.","在这次数据公布之前，中国曾表示，自12月7日结束""清零""政策以来，只有37人死于新冠。"
"The lack of transparency prompted several countries, including Japan and South Korea, to impose travel curbs on Chinese visitors after China reopened its borders last Sunday. Experts also warned that playing down the severity of the outbreak could lead people within the country to take fewer precautions.",由于缺乏透明度，在该国上周日重新开放边境后，包括日本和韩国在内的几个国家对中国游客实施了旅行限制。专家还警告，淡化疫情的严重性可能会导致该国民众不注重防护。
"China recorded 59,938 Covid-related deaths from Dec. 8 to Jan. 12, Jiao Yahui, an official with China's National Health Commission, said at a news conference in Beijing. That figure included 5,503 people who died of respiratory failure directly caused by Covid. Another 54,435 fatalities were linked to other underlying illnesses, Ms. Jiao said.",在北京的新闻发布会上，中国国家卫健委官员焦雅辉说，从12月8日到1月12日，中国记录了59938例与新冠相关的死亡病例。其中包括5503人死于由新冠直接引起的呼吸衰竭。焦雅辉说，另外54435人的死亡与其他基础疾病有关。
Ms. Jiao said China was unable to release the data on Covid-related deaths sooner because it required a comprehensive examination of hospital reporting.,焦雅辉说，中国无法尽快发布与新冠相关的死亡数据，因为需要对医院报告进行全面审核。
"""We organized experts to conduct a systematic analysis on the death cases, so it took a long time,"" Ms. Jiao said.","焦雅辉说:""我们组织专家对死亡病例进行了系统分析，因此耗时比较长。"""
"It was unclear whether the new figures mean that China has changed the way it discloses Covid deaths to include people with underlying diseases whose conditions were worsened by the virus. Officials have maintained that China's official toll counts only those who died from pneumonia or respiratory failure caused by Covid. Other countries, such as the United States and Britain, count Covid deaths more broadly.",目前尚不清楚这些新数据是否意味着中国改变了新冠死亡人数的公布方式，将患有基础疾病的人包括在内(他们的病情因病毒而恶化)。官员们坚称，中国的官方死亡人数只计入死于新冠病毒导致的肺炎或呼吸衰竭的人。美国和英国等其他国家计算的新冠死亡范围更加广泛。
"Experts said it was too soon to determine whether China had changed tack, but they welcomed the move to provide more data.",专家表示，现在判断中国是否已经改变策略为时过早，但他们对中国提供更多数据的举动表示欢迎。
"""We cannot make a judgment now, but it is obviously more reliable than the previous data saying there were only several deaths,"" said Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. ""I hope the government will be more transparent now.""","""我们现在无法做出判断，但显然比之前说只有几人死亡的数据更可靠，""香港大学病毒学家金冬雁说。""我希望政府现在会更加透明。"""
"China has narrowly counted deaths from infectious diseases for a long time, including SARS in 2003 and seasonal flu. But during the Shanghai lockdown in the spring of 2022, the authorities made an exception and used a looser definition to justify the lengthy confinement of residents. Of the 588 Covid deaths the Shanghai city government reported at that time, one was ascribed to a heart attack, and the rest to ""underlying conditions"" or ""tumors."" Despite this inconsistency, the National Health Commission has never expunged those deaths from the national toll on Covid deaths.","中国长期以来对传染病死亡病例的统计十分严格，包括季节性流感和2003年的非典。但在2022年春季上海封城期间，当局破例使用更宽松的定义来证明对居民的长期封锁是合理的。上海市政府当时报告的588例新冠死亡病例中，有一例死于心脏病，其余均为""基础疾病""或""肿瘤""。尽管与过去不一致，但国家卫健委从未从全国新冠死亡人数中删除这些死亡人数。"
"Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said the actual death toll in China, like that in every country, was almost certainly higher. He said that China could have provided more reliable data on death and infection rates if it had tested hospital patients more vigorously.",香港大学的流行病学家高本恩(Ben Cowling)说，与其他国家一样，中国的实际死亡人数几乎肯定更高。他说，如果中国对医院病人进行更积极的检测，本可以提供更可靠的死亡率和感染率数据。
"""The one thing which is a bit surprising is that China has so much testing capacity but hasn't been using it to confirm Covid in hospitalized patients,"" Mr. Cowling said.","高本恩说:""中国拥有如此强大的检测能力，但尚未用它来确认住院患者是否感染了新冠病毒，这有点令人惊讶。"""
"The National Health Commission's data confirmed longstanding fears that China's older population would be hit hard by an outbreak because so many did not receive enough vaccine doses. Of the nearly 60,000 fatalities, 56.5 percent involved someone at least 80 years old.",国家卫健委的数据证实了长期以来的担忧，即中国的老年人口将受到疫情的严重打击，因为许多人没有完全接种疫苗。在近6万死亡病例中，56.5%的人在80岁以上。
"Covid deaths are a particularly sensitive political issue in China, because Xi Jinping, the country's top leader, had championed a strategy of harsh lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing to try to contain the virus. Mr. Xi boasted that the model could be adopted by other countries after it proved successful in suppressing transmission early in the pandemic.",新冠死亡在中国是一个特别敏感的政治问题，因为该国最高领导人习近平曾倡导采取严厉封锁、隔离和大规模检测的战略，以试图遏制病毒。习近平宣称这种模式在疫情早期成功地抑制了病毒传播，可以供其他国家采用。
"As the highly infectious Omicron variant picked up steam last year, however, that strategy became untenable. As cases steadily rose across the country, protests erupted in November as more people grew weary of the Covid restrictions. Already under major economic strain, China then abruptly reversed its ""zero Covid"" policy without providing an opportunity for the country to stock up on medicine.","然而，具有高度传染性的奥密克戎变种去年流行起来后，这种策略变得难以为继。随着全国各地病例的持续上升，越来越多的人对疫情限制感到厌烦，11月多地爆发抗议活动。已经承受巨大经济压力的中国突然取消了""清零""政策，没有为国家储备药品提供机会。"
"Officials have said in recent days that infections have peaked in major cities, though concern is growing about how the current coronavirus wave will affect the nation's countryside, which has a far weaker health care system compared with China's cities.",官员们最近几天表示，主要城市的感染已经达峰，但人们越来越担心当前的新冠病毒浪潮将如何影响中国的农村，与中国的城市相比，农村的医疗保健系统要薄弱得多。
"A driver sped into pedestrians in a busy intersection in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, killing at least five people and injuring more than a dozen others, according to the police and videos posted online.",警方通告和网络视频显示，在中国南部城市广州一处闹市区的十字路口，一名司机驾车冲撞行人，造成至少五人死亡，十余人受伤。
"Officers arrested a 22-year-old man and were trying to determine a motive, according to the city's public security bureau. Videos appeared to show the driver throwing money into the air after hitting the people and before being apprehended.",广州市公安局称，警方逮捕了一名22岁的男子，正试图确定其动机。视频似乎显示撞人后的肇事司机在被逮捕之前曾向空中洒钱。
"The incident, which took place on Wednesday during the afternoon rush hour, set off shock and anger online and in Guangzhou, a city of more than 18 million people and the capital of Guangdong Province.",周三这起事件发生在晚高峰时段，在广州这个人口超1800万的广东省会城市引起了广泛的震惊和愤怒。
"Footage of the scene, in the busy Tianhe district, showed a black BMW S.U.V. entering the intersection of Tianhe Road and Tiyu East Road at high speed, making turns as it struck pedestrians and motorists in multiple crossings.",事发现场位于车水马龙的天河区，录像显示一辆黑色宝马SUV高速驶入天河路和体育东路的十字路口，在多个路口不断转向碾压路人和司机。
"Afterward, victims lay immobile and bloodied on the roads, stray shoes and phones scattered around them. ""There was a collective wail,"" Hym Chu, a 25-year-old photographer, wrote in a post on Weibo, a Twitter-like social platform. ""Everyone ran.""","事发后遇害者一动不动倒在马路上的血泊中，鞋子和手机散落在身边。""各种哀嚎声，""25岁摄影师谦仔(Hym Chu)在类似Twitter的社交平台微博上写道。""大家都在跑。"""
"Mr. Chu said he stayed for two hours at the chaotic scene, retrieving belongings for the injured and helping to move the damaged motorcycle of a delivery worker.",谦仔说他在混乱的现场待了两小时，为伤者拿回财物，并帮一名快递员扶起损坏的摩托车。
"In one video of the driver, filmed while he was being held to the ground, he shouted that his uncle was Huang Kunming, the Communist Party secretary of Guangdong Province. It was unclear whether that was true.",在拍摄肇事司机被按倒在地的一段视频中，他大喊自己的叔叔是广东省委书记黄坤明。尚不清楚这是否属实。
"It is rare for vehicles to be deliberately driven into crowds in China, but reckless driving involving luxury cars has sometimes stoked public anger, touching a nerve in a country with a stark wealth gap.",在中国，车辆故意碾压人群的事件很少见，但豪车野蛮驾驶有时会激起公愤，触动这个贫富差距悬殊的国家的敏感神经。
"More than a decade ago, in the northeastern city of Baoding, the son of Li Gang, a deputy police chief, killed a college student while drunkenly driving his Volkswagen sedan. As he was apprehended, he yelled, ""My father is Li Gang!"" Propaganda officials tried to cover up the incident, but the phrase became a grim joke symbolizing the impunity of powerful local officials and those connected to them.","十几年前，在东北部城市保定，公安局副局长李刚的儿子醉酒驾驶一辆大众轿车撞死一名大学生。在被制服时，他大喊""我爸是李刚""。宣传官员后来试图掩盖这一事件，但这句话逐渐成为有权有势的地方官员以及和他们有关系的人逍遥法外的象征。"
"Within hours of the Guangzhou incident on Wednesday, it became one of the top trending topics on Weibo, with many users decrying the senseless deaths and disparaging the driver. By Thursday morning, several graphic videos and photos from the scene had been taken down by censors.",与周三这一事件相关的话题在事发后数小时成为微博上最热门的话题之一，许多用户对无辜者的惨死发起谴责，愤怒声讨肇事司机。到周四早上，审查人员已经删除了许多事故现场的视频和图片细节。
"A furious, wide-ranging argument is unfolding on the internet in China over the reversal of the government's strict pandemic policies and the massive Covid surge that followed. The divisions are challenging the Communist Party's efforts to control the narrative around its pandemic pivot.",中国互联网上正在展开一场激烈且涉及范围广泛的争论，人们对政府突然逆转严格的疫情防控政策，以及随之而来的大规模感染存在意见分歧。这些分歧正在挑战中共控制疫情政策扭转叙事的努力。
"Since the party abandoned ""zero Covid"" last month, many online commenters have staked out opposing positions over seemingly all manner of questions. Who should be blamed for the explosion of cases and deaths? Is a top government-appointed health expert trustworthy? Is Omicron really less severe, as Chinese officials now say, when hospitals seem to be filling up with sick patients? They are even arguing over whether people should be allowed to set off fireworks during the upcoming Spring Festival holiday, after many did so during the New Year.","自上个月中共放弃""清零""政策以来，许多人在网上似乎就各种问题发表了对立的观点。谁该为感染人数和死亡人数的爆炸式增长负责?政府委任的最高级别卫生专家值得信赖吗?奥密克戎变异株真的如中国官员现在所说的那样，并不太严重吗?如果是这样，为什么医院里看起来挤满了患者?人们甚至在争论是否应该允许大家在即将到来的春节期间燃放烟花爆竹，以前许多人都有在新年燃放烟花爆竹的习惯。"
"The digital finger-pointing reveals a country that is deeply polarized, with each side distrustful and skeptical of the other and, to varying degrees, of the party and its proxies. In some cases, the party's own supporters are indirectly questioning its decisions, complicating efforts by the party's censors and propaganda outlets to push its messaging.",网上的相互指责揭示了一个意见严重对立的国家，各方都不信任对方，他们相互怀疑，并在不同程度上对中共以及代表其发言的人持怀疑态度。在某些情况下，中共自己的支持者也在间接地质疑党的决定，使得党的审查员和宣传机构推动党传达信息的努力变得复杂起来。
"""The sudden 180-degree turn from 'zero Covid' has precipitated a new crisis for which the government needs to explain to the people,"" said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College who studies Chinese politics. The party now needs to contain Covid infections, rescue an economy dragged down by its ""zero Covid"" policy, and repair the damage to its image caused by the chaotic reopening, Mr. Pei said.","""突然从'新冠清零'来了个180度大转弯，这已引发了一场新的危机，政府需要向人民解释，""在克莱蒙麦肯纳学院研究中国政治的政府系教授裴敏欣说。中共现在需要遏制新冠病毒感染，挽救被""清零""政策拖累的经济，修复混乱的重新放开给形象造成的损害，裴敏欣说。"
"If Beijing moves too hard to quash discord, it could further alienate many who had long defended ""zero Covid"" and who have been confused or disappointed by the sudden policy U-turn. But if it lets the arguments escalate, it risks muddying its message and seeding more uncertainty.","如果中国政府在压制这些分歧上做得过于粗暴，它有可能会进一步疏远许多曾一直支持""新冠清零""政策的人，他们现在对突然的政策大转弯感到困惑或失望。但如果政府让争论升级的话，就有可能让其想传递的信息变得模糊，播下更多不确定性的种子。"
"""It's very damaging for Chinese society if society is divided into very antagonistic groups who are equally powerless, equally helpless and they accuse each other,"" said Xiang Biao, a Germany-based expert on social issues in China.","""如果社会被分化成意见非常敌对的群体，让这些同样无能为力、同样无助的群体相互指责，这对中国社会非常有害，""旅居德国的中国社会问题专家项飚说。"
"By far, the more vocal side is made up of those who supported ""zero Covid"" a mix of nationalist online influencers, conservative academics, and a number of trolls. Some saw the stringent policy as necessary to save lives in a country where medical services are uneven. Others adopted the party's argument that ""zero Covid"" was a measure of China's superior political model.","到目前为止，这些争论中声音最大的一方由那些曾支持新冠""清零""的人组成，他们包括网上的民族主义意见领袖、保守派学者以及一些喷子。他们中有些人将严格的""清零""视为在一个医疗服务不均衡的国家为挽救生命而必须采取的政策。也有些人则接受了中共的说法，认为新冠""清零""是衡量中国优越政治模式的一个标准。"
"Some voices in the so-called ""zero Covid faction"" have sought to blame the protesters opposed to lockdowns for the current outbreak and rising deaths, even though the virus had been spreading wildly before the policy U-turn. They call those who supported the end of ""zero Covid"" ""tangfei,"" or ""lying flat bandits,"" an insulting variation of ""lying flat,"" a term used to refer to a slacker lifestyle that had earlier been co-opted by Chinese state media to criticize Western approaches to coexisting with Covid.","在所谓""清零派""当中，有些声音已在寻求将目前的疫情和不断上升的死亡人数归咎于反对封控的抗议者，尽管新冠病毒在政策大转弯之前就已经在失控地传播。他们称那些支持结束""清零""的人为""躺匪""，这是从""躺平""一词演化出来的骂人话。""躺平""是中国人用来描述懒散生活方式的说法，官媒之前曾用它来批评西方与新冠病毒共存的做法。"
"Implied in some of the criticism is that by undoing ""zero Covid,"" the party has empowered its detractors at home and in the West, and weakened its position even among its own loyalists. For a time, online influencers such as Sima Nan, a nationalist, even took to denigrating government-appointed experts such as Zhang Wenhong, a top epidemiologist in Shanghai who had argued against excessive lockdowns, suggesting that Dr. Zhang had misled the public about the severity of Omicron. The vitriol was so great that state media outlets soon called for such personal attacks to stop.","有些批评暗示，中共取消""新冠清零""政策的做法让国内和西方的恶意批评者们有了主动权，甚至在中共忠实的支持者中削弱了党的地位。有段时间，民族主义者司马南等网红甚至开始诋毁政府指认的专家，比如反对过度封控的上海著名流行病学家张文宏，他们暗示，张文宏误导了公众对奥密克戎变异株严重性的认识。他们使用的语言非常尖刻，以至于官方媒体很快要求停止这种人身攻击。"
"On the other side are those who have welcomed the resumption of school, work, business and travel as not merely a relief from lockdowns but a much-needed retreat by the Communist Party from everyday life. Many identify themselves as part of the ""opening up"" or ""lift lockdowns"" faction associated with the university students, migrant workers, residents and small-business owners who protested against ""zero Covid"" in November.","争论的另一方包括那些欢迎学校复课，恢复工作、商务和旅行的人，他们不仅把解除封控视为一种解脱，也视为中共从人们日常生活中的退出，是社会迫切需要的。许多自认属于""放开""或""解封""派的人与去年11月底抗议新冠""清零""政策的大学生、农民工、居民和小企业主有关。"
"Even Xi Jinping, the country's top leader, made a rare acknowledgment of the public disagreements, saying in a New Year's address: ""It is only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue.""","就连中国最高领导人习近平也罕见地承认了公众意见存在分歧，他在新年致辞中说:""不同人会有不同诉求，对同一件事也会有不同看法，这很正常。"""
"He emphasized, though, that he expected Chinese people to fall in line, and to ""think in one direction, work in one direction. The strength of tomorrow's China comes from unity,"" he said.","但他强调希望中国人保持一致，""心往一处想、劲往一处使，同舟共济、众志成城，就没有干不成的事、迈不过的坎。"""
"For much of the past three years, Mr. Xi had brooked no opposition, brandishing the ""zero Covid"" policy as proof of the authoritarian party's superiority in protecting people over that of chaotic Western democracies. Now, along with a mounting public health crisis, the authorities find themselves having to rein in their own usual defenders, those who had helped prop up ""zero Covid"" as the only way forward.","在过去三年的大部分时间里，习近平一直不允许有任何反对意见，把新冠""清零""政策宣扬为威权主义的中共在保护人民生命安全上比混乱的西方民主国家优越的证据。现在，随着国内公共卫生危机加剧，当局发现不得不控制那些通常捍卫中共的人，这些人曾帮助将""清零""捧为唯一可行的做法。"
"Tao Siliang, a member of China's Communist elite, recently criticized Sima Nan's attacks for contradicting the party's new direction. On Thursday, Weibo, a social media site, moved quickly to shut down or suspend more than 1,000 accounts, including that of a prominent nationalist, Kong Qingdong, for waging personal attacks against experts and scholars.",陶思亮是中共精英人士当中的一员，她最近批评了司马南人身攻击的做法，称其有违党的新方向。上周四，社交媒体网站微博迅速关闭或暂停了1000多个帐号，包括著名民族主义者孔庆东的帐号，因为这些帐号对专家和学者发起了人身攻击。
"""At this moment, what we need most is to abide by the 44-year-old parable: 'Look forward in unity,' do not challenge, tear apart, especially denounce or abuse,"" the official newspaper of Zhejiang Province, in China's east, wrote in a recent editorial.","""此刻，我们最需信守的，还是44年前的那句老话:'团结一致向前看' 而不是对立、撕裂，更不是攻讦、谩骂，""浙江省的官方报纸在最近一篇社评中写道。"
"But some ""zero Covid"" defenders, apparently disillusioned by the turn of events, rejected the call for conformity.","但一些捍卫""清零""人显然对事态的转变感到失望，他们拒绝了团结一致的号召。"
"""Please tell me, why do I have to unite?"" read a post that was liked 30,000 times and was written by a blogger on Weibo who described losing an uncle to complications caused by Covid. ""On what basis should I be forced to accept the lone societal argument that everything is going great?""","""请告诉我，凭什么逼我团结?""微博上一篇被点赞3万次的帖子写道，该帖子的博主描述了一个有基础病的舅舅，因感染了新冠病毒，病情恶化后去世的情况。""凭什么逼我必须接受单一的，一切都在向好发展的社会论调?"""
"Some see the opposition to reopening as mostly posturing by online personalities interested in attracting more followers, and predict that the anger will blow over once outbreaks peak and pass, and the economy recovers.",一些人认为反对重新开放主要是网络名人为了吸引更多关注者而摆出的姿态。他们预测一旦感染的高峰过去了，经济复苏了，这种愤怒就会平息下来。
"To Wu Qiang, an independent political analyst in Beijing, the online backlash is a sign of a deeper challenge to Beijing. Mr. Xi's New Year address, he said, was a ""rare recognition that he is facing objections, criticism and dissatisfaction inside and outside the party.""","在北京的独立政治分析人士吴强看来，网上的强烈反对意见是中国政府面临更深层次挑战的征兆。他说，习近平在新年讲话中""其实是罕见地承认面对党内外的异议，批评和不满""。"
"At the same time, Mr. Wu said, Mr. Xi's ""zero Covid"" policy of top-down control pushed people to question the party's authoritarian approach, fanning a new political fervor that could, over time, gain momentum. ""In some ways, if you look at things from the vantage point of the future, the current 'lying flat' faction is a broad foundation for a future Chinese opposition party,"" Mr. Wu said.","与此同时，吴强说，习近平""清零""政策自上而下的控制促使人们质疑中共的威权做法，掀起了一种新的政治热情，随着时间的推移，这种热情的势头可能会增长。""某种意义上讲，如果说我们站在未来来看中国将来政治格局变化的话，其实现在的躺平派就是未来的中国一个最广泛的反对派的基础，""吴强说。"
"If there is one issue that both sides seem to agree on, it is that the government is hurting its credibility by not providing reliable data on the extent of Covid outbreaks and deaths across the country. The official Covid death toll is widely ridiculed on Chinese social media as absurdly low. The World Health Organization and several countries have urged Beijing to share more data on hospitalizations and deaths. The information vacuum has fueled speculation by influencers and bloggers who have pushed their own conclusions and conspiracies around the policy pivot.",如果说有一个问题是争论双方持一致看法的，那就是，政府不提供全国新冠感染病例和死亡人数的可靠数据正在损害其信誉。在社交媒体上，人们大肆嘲笑中国官方发布的新冠死亡人数低到荒唐。世界卫生组织和几个国家已敦促中国政府分享更多住院患者和死亡人数的数据。信息真空助长了网上影响者和博主的猜测，他们在政策反转问题上推出了自己的结论和阴谋论。
"A key factor in the mutual infighting was the ""collapse of public trust,"" said Mr. Xiang of Oxford, who is also the director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Germany. ""Government data, policies and experts' opinion lost credibility.""","这种相互明争暗斗的一个关键因素是""公众信任的崩溃""，项飚说，他是德国马克斯·普朗克社会人类学研究所所长，也是牛津大学的教授。""政府的数据和政策，以及政府专家的意见，已经失去了可信度。"""
"In a recent post on social media, Hu Xijin, the nationalist former editor of the Communist Party newspaper, Global Times, suggested that the party could afford to be more open to debate.",中共报纸《环球时报》的前总编辑胡锡进最近在社交媒体上发帖表示，中共经受得起更公开的辩论。
"""Our society can have problems and difficulties, but there should not be too many things deemed 'sensitive,'"" he wrote.","""我们的社会里可以有问题，有困难，但不应有太多'敏感'的东西，""他写道。"

"Infections soared across China late last year, and the government abruptly lifted its strict, but ultimately futile, Covid restrictions in early December. Shanghai endured one of China's most grueling lockdowns last spring, with residents confined to their homes for more than two months.",去年末，中国各地的感染人数飙升，政府在12月初突然取消了其严苛、但最终徒劳无效的防疫政策。上海去年春天经历了中国最令人痛苦的封锁，居民被限制在家中超过两个月。
"China's current wave of infections has been fueled by a lack of immunity in the population, most of which was not exposed to the coronavirus for years because of the country's strict controls. In addition, many older adults never received a full course of vaccines or booster shots.",人群免疫力缺乏助长了中国目前的这波感染，由于国家的严格控制，大多数人几年来没有接触过新冠病毒。此外，许多老年人从未接受过完整的疫苗注射或打加强针。
"The following photographs capture the grief and anxiety that swept across Shanghai over the weekend, beginning with this image of patients being taken to the emergency room of a Shanghai hospital.",从这张病人被送入上海一家医院急诊室的照片开始，以下这些照片捕捉了在周末席卷上海的悲痛和焦虑。

"The nearest hospital was an hour away, and few could afford the $7 bus fare there. The village clinic is not equipped with oxygen tanks or even an oximeter to detect if someone's blood is dangerously deprived of oxygen. It quickly ran out of its stockpile of five boxes of fever medicine, so officials told sick residents to stay home and drink lots of water.",最近的医院有一个小时的路程，很少有人能负担得起50元左右的汽车票。村卫生室没有配备氧气罐，甚至没有血氧仪来检测一个人的血液中是否严重缺氧。五盒退烧药库存很快就用完了，因此村干部告诉生病的村民呆在家里多喝水。
"For three years, the villagers had avoided the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. But late last year, Covid infections surged across China, forcing the government to abandon its stringent, yet ultimately futile, policy of mass lockdowns. It was only a matter of time before the virus wound its way out of the cities and arrived in poorer rural areas like Dadi, in Guizhou Province, with the barest of medical care.",三年来，村民们避免了最严重的新冠病毒大流行。但去年年底，新冠感染在中国各地激增，迫使政府放弃其严格但最终徒劳的大规模封锁政策。病毒从城市蔓延开来，到达贵州省大地村这样医疗条件恶劣的贫困农村地区，只是个时间问题。
"China is bracing for an onslaught of infections in its fragile countryside as millions of migrant workers crowd onto trains and buses to leave factory towns, construction sites and cities, to return to their rural homes for the Lunar New Year holiday. The travel period, which begins Saturday and lasts 40 days, is expected to overwhelm the rural health care system only weeks after hospitals in wealthy cities like Beijing and Shanghai were buckled by the outbreak.",随着数以百万计的外来务工者涌上火车和长途汽车离开工业城市、建筑工地和城市，返乡过年，中国正在准备迎接脆弱的农村地区的感染冲击。从上周六开始、持续40天的旅行期预计将使农村医疗保健系统不堪重负，仅数周前，北京和上海等富裕城市的医院因疫情暴发而瘫痪。
"""What we are most worried about is that after three years, everyone can finally go home for the new year to visit relatives,"" Jiao Yahui, an official with China's National Health Commission, told state media.

"In Dadi, the local clinic is little more than a converted cottage with four rooms and a closet. At best, it can offer intravenous drips, but for no more than five or six people at a time. No one from the county government told the village to prepare for an outbreak, Gao Hong, a village official, said by phone.",在大地村，本地卫生所是一座经过改建的平房，有四个房间和一个储藏室。它至多可以打吊瓶，但一次不超过五六个人。村干部高宏在电话中说，县政府没有人通知村里要为疫情暴发做好准备。
"Because cases in Dadi have so far been mild, Mr. Gao said, villagers were most in need of fever-reducing and cough medicines, but even those have been hard to come by. ""We are too remote to get any medicine purchased online delivered,"" he said.","高宏表示，由于大地村的病例到目前为止都是轻症，村民们最需要的是退烧药和止咳药，但即使是这些药也很难买到。""像我们这么偏根本寄不过来，网上也买不到，""他说。"
"Despite the lack of reliable government data, there are signs that Covid is already being transmitted freely in the countryside, particularly in places with large numbers of returning migrants like central Henan Province.",尽管缺乏可靠的政府数据，但有迹象表明，新冠病毒已经在农村肆意传播，尤其是在像中部省份河南这样有大量返乡农民工的地方。
"Long lines of people have been forming outside village clinics there, according to state media. Such clinics and local community health centers are meant to serve as the first line of defense in a triage system and preventing overcrowding at county hospitals, which are often the closest places rural residents can be treated for serious medical conditions.",据官方媒体报道，河南的村卫生所外已经排起了长队。这些诊所和地方社区卫生中心旨在作为分流系统的第一道防线，防止县医院过度拥挤，而县医院往往是农村居民患重病时距离最近的去处。
One such county hospital in Henan was so inundated with patients from the surrounding countryside that it had to ration fever-reducing medicine to patients registering a body temperature of 101.3 degrees or higher. Officials at another county hospital in central Anhui Province said they had received so many patients that the facility would soon run out of critical care beds and ventilators.,河南一家县级医院挤满了来自周边农村的患者，以至于它不得不向体温达到或超过38.5摄氏度的患者定量配给退烧药。另一家位于中部省份安徽的县医院的负责人说，他们收治的病人太多，重症监护病床和呼吸机很快就要不够用了。
"China's countryside is less densely populated than its cities, which could mean the virus will spread less quickly. But Omicron variants have proven so infectious that population density may not make a difference, especially as friends and families gather to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Rural areas are also home to a disproportionate number of older adults, because so many younger people have left for the cities to seek better job opportunities.",中国农村人口密度低于城市，这可能意味着病毒传播速度较慢。但事实证明，奥密克戎变种的传染性如此之强，以至于人口密度可能不会产生什么影响，尤其是在朋友和家人聚在一起庆祝春节的时候。由于许多年轻人前往城市寻找更好的工作机会，农村地区也居住着大量老年人口。
"The rate of vaccination in the rural areas is unclear. Nationwide, older adults have lower booster rates in general. The government tried in 2021 to ramp up inoculations but encountered resistance among residents skeptical of the safety of the vaccines, state media reported.",农村地区的疫苗接种率尚不清楚。在全国范围内，老年人的免疫接种率普遍较低。据官方媒体报道，政府曾在2021年尝试加大疫苗接种力度，但遭到居民的抵制，他们对疫苗的安全性持怀疑态度。
"""When people move around, we are very likely going to see a surge of cases in the countryside, but the health care system does not have the capacity to withstand the rapid increase of demand,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.","""当人们四处流动时，我们很可能会看到农村病例激增，但医疗保健系统没有能力承受快速增长的需求，""对外关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠说。"
"Other countries such as India have already experienced the devastating consequences of a runaway outbreak in rural areas with underdeveloped health care. What later became known as the Delta variant tore through the Indian countryside in early 2021, leaving bodies floating in the Ganges and villagers clamoring for what little supplies of oxygen were available.",在印度等国，卫生保健不发达的农村地区已经经历了失控疫情的破坏性后果。2021年初，后来被称为德尔塔的变种席卷了印度乡村，恒河中漂浮着尸体，村民们强烈要求获得氧气瓶，但供应难以满足需求。
"In China, few things highlight the inequities between urban and rural life as starkly as medical care. Despite ongoing health reforms, access to everything from ventilators to fever medicine remains scant for the 500 million people who live in the countryside. Staffing in rural health facilities is also woefully low. There are 1.3 million physicians and 1.8 million nurses in rural China roughly less than half as many per 1,000 people as there are in the cities, government statistics show.",在中国，城乡生活水平的差距在医疗上可能体现得最为突出。尽管医疗改革正在进行，但生活在农村的5亿人口仍面临从呼吸机到退烧药等各种用品的短缺。农村卫生机构的人员配备也少得可怜。政府数据显示，中国农村有130万名医师和180万名护士——每千人口医护数量还不及城市的一半。
"Rural communities are largely served by grassroots health workers who have only minimal medical training less than 1 percent hold university degrees, and just over half have graduated from vocational high schools. They're often called upon only when needed.",在农村社区提供服务的基本都是只受过最低程度医疗培训的基层医务人员，拥有大学学历的人不到1%，毕业于职业高中的人刚过半数。他们通常只在有需要的时候上岗。
"""Village doctor is only a side job. The doctors need to farm as well,"" said Hunter Ge, a migrant worker describing the level of care in Maxiaoji, his village of about 700 people in Henan that's been hit with a massive virus outbreak.","""乡村医生只是副业。医生也得务农，""农民工亨特·葛这样描述他所在村庄马小集的医疗水平，这个约有700人口的河南村庄发生了大规模疫情。"
Mr. Ge said village doctors couldn't be relied upon for treating major illnesses but were often the only local source of medicine.,亨特·葛说，不能指望乡村医生医治严重疾病，但他们往往是当地唯一的药品供应者。
"""They are quite nice,"" said Mr. Ge, who works at a factory. ""You can call a village doctor at midnight, if needed.""","""他们人都很好，""在工厂打工的亨特·葛说。""如果需要，半夜给乡村医生打电话都可以。"""
"Village health workers can provide basic services such as vaccinating babies and treating minor ailments. But experts say it's unrealistic to expect them to know how to effectively treat Covid. Their lack of training makes them risk-averse, increasing the odds they'll send people to a hospital and exacerbate overcrowding.",农村医务人员可以提供基本服务，例如为婴儿接种疫苗，治疗小病小痛。但专家表示，指望他们懂得如何有效治疗新冠是不现实的。由于缺乏培训，他们不敢冒险，导致他们宁愿把病人送到医院，这加剧了医院的负担。
"""What you ideally want is for people with less severe conditions to stay away from the higher-tier hospitals,"" said Sean Sylvia, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina who has studied rural China. ""And if you're relying on village doctors to appropriately triage patients, there's a big question as to whether they can do that.""","""理想情况下，病情不太严重的患者不应该去级别更高的医院就诊，""北卡罗来纳大学研究中国乡村问题的卫生政策助教肖恩·西尔维亚说。""但如果要靠乡村医生对病人进行适当的分类，他们能否做到这一点都是个大问题。"""
"The government is scrambling to address the looming crisis with social distancing restrictions, vaccination campaigns and pledges to improve the supply of drugs.",政府忙于通过限制社交距离、开展疫苗接种活动和承诺改善药品供应情况来应对迫在眉睫的危机。
"In southwestern Sichuan Province, officials recently ordered villages to restrict gatherings at weddings, banquets and mahjong parlors. And southern Yunnan Province is urging returning migrants to stay away from crowds and older people.",在西南省份四川，官员最近要求限制婚礼、宴会和麻将馆等场所的人员聚集。南方的云南省则敦促返乡务工人员远离人群和老年群体。
"As recently as last month, the National Health Commission called on health workers in the countryside to expedite efforts to fully vaccinate rural residents, particularly older adults. In the southern island of Hainan, teams of Communist Party cadres, doctors and nurses are going door to door to vaccinate villagers.",就在上个月，国家卫健委才呼吁乡村医务人员加快为农村居民，特别是老年人口全面接种疫苗。在南方的海南岛，一批批党员干部、医生和护士正在挨家挨户为村民打疫苗。
"The shortage of cough and fever medicines has been widespread, a result of the explosion of infections and stockpiling by residents. But those drugs only relieve symptoms. Antiviral treatments such as Pfizer's Paxlovid, which can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, are far more expensive and scarcer, even in cities where health care services are better, let alone the countryside.",由于感染激增和居民囤药，止咳和退烧药普遍短缺。但这些药只能缓解症状。辉瑞的奈玛特韦片/利托那韦片(Paxlovid)等抗病毒药物能降低住院和死亡风险，但价格更贵也更加稀缺，在医疗条件更好的城市尚且如此，更不用说农村。
"The State Council, China's cabinet, issued a directive last week calling on local authorities and Communist Party cadres to marshal resources to blunt the outbreak by, among other things, ensuring medical supplies, bolstering critical care and prioritizing older adults. The cabinet called for grassroots health workers to distribute health kits packed with fever and cough medicine, rapid antigen tests and masks to vulnerable groups.",中国国务院上周发出通知，要求地方当局和党员干部统筹资源，通过保障医疗物资供应、提升重症救治水平以及优先照顾老年群体等措施遏制疫情。国务院要求基层卫生人员为脆弱群体发放健康包，里面有退烧和止咳药、快速抗原检测试剂和口罩。
Public health experts say the last-minute efforts underscore how ill-prepared the country was for the U-turn in Covid strategy.,公共卫生专家表示，这样的临时抱佛脚凸显出中国对于新冠防疫政策急转弯的准备有多么不足。
"""The bottom line is that these measures should have been rolled out prior to the policy pivot,"" Mr. Huang of the Council on Foreign Relations said of the State Council's directive.","""归根结底，这些措施本应在政策转向之前推出，""外交关系协会的黄严忠在谈到国务院的指示时表示。"
"""Many of the problems we are seeing in rural China are fundamentally problems in China's health care reform, and you cannot expect to fix them in such a short period of time,"" he said. ""In short, they won't be effective in significantly mitigating the harmful effects of the unbridled spread of Covid-19 in the countryside.""","""中国农村存在的许多问题都是中国医疗改革的根本性问题，不能指望在短时间内就得到解决，""他说。""简而言之，这些措施不能有效地显著缓解新冠病毒在农村大肆传播所带来的有害影响。"""
"Mr. Gao, the official in Dadi, said donors and nongovernmental groups recently delivered medicine to his village, offering relief for the community's 760 residents. He estimates that 300 migrants will return to Dadi in the coming weeks and fuel infections, which currently stand at over 150. Even if the medicine runs out, most will try to ride out the illness at home.",大地村官员高宏表示，捐赠者和非政府组织最近向他的村庄运送了药品，为村里的760名居民提供救济。他估计，未来几周将有300名农民工返回大地村并加剧感染情况，目前的感染人数已超过150人。即使药用完了，大多数人也会在家中设法扛过去。
"""This is not a rich village, it's quite poor, actually,"" Mr. Gao said. ""It's not realistic for villagers to spend 50 yuan to take a bus and buy medicine in the county. Even if they did take a bus, there's no guarantee they'd get medicine because of the extreme scarcity.""","""这个村本身就不富裕，属于一个贫困村了吧，""高宏说。""来回(一趟)村民(要)花50块钱，为了买点药，买药就算是坐车去都不一定能买到，这个药特别匮乏。"""
"HONG KONG Over the past three years, Zhou Wanhui, a Hong Kong resident, has visited her parents in China just three times. Though they live only two hours away by train, Covid restrictions made it so difficult to cross the Hong Kong border into mainland China that one of Ms. Zhou's trips included a three-hour flight to Shanghai and nearly a month of quarantine in two cities.",香港——过去三年里，生活在香港的周婉蕙(音)与住在内地的父母只见过三次面。虽然他们住的地方相距只有两小时的火车车程，但遏制新冠病毒的疾控措施让人们从香港入境内地变得如此之困难，以至于有一次周女士回内地时不得不坐了三个小时的飞机先飞到上海，然后在两个城市共计集中隔离了近一个月。
"Families like Ms. Zhou's kept apart for weddings and funerals, birthdays and graduations are finally preparing for less arduous reunions.",像周女士这样的家庭已经几年没能为婚礼、葬礼、生日和毕业典礼聚在一起，现在他们终于能为没有那么艰难的团聚做准备了。
"On Sunday, China fully opened its borders for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, welcoming visitors without strict quarantine requirements and allowing its citizens to go overseas once again just as the travel period for Lunar New Year, typically the busiest season, begins. In Hong Kong's airport, hundreds of people waited to check in for flights to cities in the south like Xiamen and Chongqing and in the north like Beijing and Tianjin, but the arrivals hall was more quiet. Many of the city's border checkpoints were reopened; empty transportation halls filled up with groups of people, and shuttered storefronts were open once again.",中国大陆已在周日开放了边境。这是自新冠病毒大流行开始以来，大陆不再要求入境者进行集中隔离后首次迎来游客，并在中国最繁忙的旅行季节农历新年到来之际再次允许本国公民出国。在香港机场，数以百计的人正在等着办理飞往厦门、重庆等南方城市，以及北京、天津等北方城市的航班值机手续，但到达大厅则安静得多。香港通往内地的许多边境检查站已重新开门;曾经空荡荡的运输大厅里挤满了人，关了门的商铺也重新开张了。
"Ms. Zhou, 22, a university student, texted her parents that she planned to be home for Lunar New Year on Jan. 22. ""Wow, this is such happy news! The border is finally open,"" her parents wrote back with a line of thumbs-up emoji.","现年22岁的周女士是一名大学生，她给父母发短信说打算今年1月22日回家过年。""哇塞，这个消息好开心啊，终于开关啦，""她父母回复道，还用了好几个大拇指的表情符。"
"But unease, from both travelers and nations that have long waited to welcome deep-pocketed Chinese tourists again, has tempered the celebratory mood.",但来自旅行者和一些国家的不安给庆祝的气氛泼下冷水，一些国家曾一直在等待迎接出手阔绰的中国游客。
"As China swiftly abandoned Covid restrictions, a ferocious outbreak has ripped through the country in recent weeks, causing chaos in hospitals and putting pressure on health care workers. Beijing's decision, announced less than two weeks ago, to open its borders has left many surprised, confused and cautious.",随着中国异常迅速地放弃了新冠病毒防控措施，狂风暴雨般的疫情已在最近几周席卷了全国各地，给医院制造了混乱，给医护人员带来了压力。中国政府在不到两周前宣布开放边境的决定让许多人惊讶、困惑和谨慎。
"""It was too abrupt,"" said Jenny Zhao, 34, referring to China's swift reversal of its Covid policies. Ms. Zhao, who is a marketing manager, has been living in Singapore for the past year. She found herself stuck overseas with near-impossible barriers to getting back home to China last year and decided to stay put after finding a job with an international company.","""太突然了，""现年34岁的珍妮·赵(音)说，她指的是中国""新冠清零""政策的迅速逆转。赵女士是一名营销经理，过去一年一直住在新加坡。去年，她发现自己被困在了海外，回国的障碍几乎不可克服，她在一家国际公司找到一份工作后，决定留在新加坡。"
"Now, with infections spreading in China, Ms. Zhao isn't sure she is ready to go back.",现在，随着新冠病毒在中国蔓延，赵女士拿不准自己是否做好了回国的准备。
"""All of my family members, including my grandmother, who is 88 years old, have gotten Covid,"" Ms. Zhao said. Her mother told her that everyone in their 3,000-unit compound in the southern city of Chongqing seems to be sick with the virus.","""我所有的家人，包括我88岁的祖母，都感染了新冠病毒，""赵女士说。她妈妈告诉她，他们在重庆一个有3000户人家的小区里，几乎每个人都感染了新冠病毒。"
"Instead of going there over the Lunar New Year, Ms. Zhao has decided to wait until summer to see her family. By then, she hopes, the current surge in Covid numbers will have fallen, restrictions on Chinese travelers overseas will have eased and airfare will be less expensive. Ms. Zhao said she plans to then take her parents on a trip to Thailand.",赵女士不打算在春节期间回国，而是决定等到夏天再与家人团聚。她希望到那时，新冠病毒感染人数激增的情况将得到缓解，国外对来自中国游客的限制将会放松，机票价格也会降下来。赵女士说，她打算夏天带父母去泰国旅行。
"Nations around the world are eager to welcome the return of Chinese tourists like Ms. Zhao and her parents. Before the pandemic, Chinese tourists spent $250 billion a year overseas. Their abrupt disappearance in early 2020, when China suspended tour groups and travel packages, plunged many tour guides and travel operators into bankruptcy. The impact was acutely felt in places like Thailand, Japan and South Korea.",世界各国都想迎来像赵女士和她父母这样的中国游客。在新冠病毒大流行之前，中国游客每年在海外的消费达2500亿美元。中国在2020年初暂停了旅行团和包价旅游后，中国游客在国外突然消失了，导致了许多当地的导游和旅行社破产。泰国、日本和韩国等地受到的影响最为严重。
"But some of those same countries are also hesitating between attracting Chinese tourists and concerns from health experts about the extent of China's Covid outbreak, the potential for new mutations of the coronavirus and the possible strain that sick tourists could have on health care systems.",但这些国家中有些也在吸引中国游客与卫生专家的担忧之间犹豫不决，后者担心中国目前新冠疫情的严重程度、可能出现新变异株，以及感染了病毒的游客可能对本国医疗系统带来的压力。
"Global health experts and the World Health Organization have warned that the outbreak in China, and the country's opacity in reporting cases, has made it hard to assess the severity of the situation.",全球卫生专家和世界卫生组织警告，中国暴发的疫情以及在报告病例方面的不透明使局势的严重性难以评估。
"In recent days, dozens of countries worldwide have started to require Covid testing and health monitoring of travelers coming from China. That's prompted rebuke from Beijing, which has argued that the moves have no scientific basis.",最近几天，全球数十个国家开始要求对来自中国的旅客进行新冠病毒检测和健康监测。这招致了北京方面的谴责，称这些举措没有科学依据。
"The European Union on Wednesday said it ""strongly encouraged"" its 27 members to put in place testing and masking requirements as Chinese travelers begin to return to popular European cities.","欧盟周三表示，随着中国游客开始返回欧洲热门城市，它""强烈鼓励""27个成员国实施检测和佩戴口罩的要求。"
"Even Hong Kong, where the government imposed many of the same border restrictions as China until a few months ago, has taken a cautious approach to opening its border with the mainland, capping the number of visitors at 60,000 people a day. The rule will be applied to Hong Kong visitors traveling north as well. Anyone entering either side of the border is required to show a negative P.C.R. test.",就连香港在开放与大陆的边境方面也采取了谨慎的态度，将每天的游客人数限制在6万人，仅在几个月前，香港政府实施了许多与中国相同的边境限制。去内地旅行的香港游客也需要遵守该规定。任何出入边境的人都必须出示核酸阴性检测结果。
"On Jeju Island, a South Korean destination once favored by Chinese tourists, many businesses are in wait-and-see mode. The government has halted all direct flights from China to the island, redirecting visitors to the country's main airport in Seoul, where travelers will have to take a P.C.R. test upon arrival and quarantine if they are found to be sick.",在曾经深受中国游客青睐的韩国旅游胜地济州岛，不少商家都处于观望状态。政府已停止从中国到该岛的所有直飞航班，将游客引向位于首尔的主要机场，旅客必须在抵达时进行核酸检测，如果发现感染则将被隔离。
"""We are focused on alternative markets for the time being, such as Japan and Southeast Asia,"" said Kim Chang-hyo, an official at the Jeju Island Tourism Association. South Korea has also stopped processing short-term visas for Chinese nationals, except those for diplomatic or business visits.","""我们暂时专注于其他市场，例如日本和东南亚，""济州岛旅游协会官员金昌孝(音)说。韩国也停止为中国公民办理短期签证，外交或商务访问除外。"
"Thailand's response has been friendlier. One government minister floated the idea of offering booster vaccines to Chinese tourists. Another urged Thais not to ""bully"" Chinese visitors based on unfounded fears about Covid.","泰国的反应更为友好。一位政府部长提出了向中国游客提供疫苗加强针的想法。另一位敦促泰国人不要基于对新冠的毫无根据的恐惧而""欺负""中国游客。"
"But the Thai government is also taking measures to prevent its hospital system from being inundated by a sudden outbreak now that China's borders are open. All visitors to the country must have two shots of a Covid vaccine, and the government has recommended mask-wearing in public. Visitors also must also have medical insurance to cover Covid treatment if they get sick.",但泰国政府也在采取措施，防止其医院系统在中国边境开放后因突然暴发疫情而不堪重负。所有来该国的游客都必须注射两针新冠疫苗，政府还建议在公共场合戴口罩。如果游客生病，必须有医疗保险支付新冠病毒治疗费用。
"Thailand is anticipating around 300,000 Chinese visitors in the first three months of 2023, said Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the country's Tourism Authority. ""There are only 15 flights per week compared to before Covid, where there are around 400 flights per week,"" he said. Before the pandemic, nearly a million Chinese tourists visited every month.","泰国旅游局局长育他沙·素巴颂表示，预计2023年前三个月泰国将接待约30万中国游客。""新冠之前每周大约有400个航班，相比之下现在每周只有15个航班，""他说。在疫情之前，每月有近百万的中国游客来访。"
"At the Maetaeng Elephant Park in the northern Thai province of Chiang Mai, employees said they were excited to see Chinese tourists return. For now, though, they are busy with South Koreans, who have largely replaced the Chinese as their biggest clientele.",在泰国北部清迈省的湄登大象公园，员工们表示，他们很高兴看到中国游客回归。不过目前，他们忙于接待韩国游客，韩国人已基本取代中国人成为他们最大的客户群体。
"""It is all still wait and see,"" said Thipsuda Poungmalee, a sales and marketing manager at the park.","""一切都还在观望中，""公园的销售和营销经理基普苏达·彭马莱说。"
"In Osaka, Japan, where Chinese tourists would sometimes make the news for what the Japanese call ""bakugai"" or explosive buying the optimism is also muted. ""Of course, it has been much quieter without tourists from China, the city has been less lively,"" said Makoto Tsuda, an official with the Osaka Prefecture's Tourism Promotion office. Before the pandemic, nearly half of all foreign visitors to the city came from China, he said.","在中国游客有时会因为日本人形容的""爆买""而上新闻的大阪，乐观情绪也减弱了。""当然，没有来自中国的游客，这座城市安静了许多，也没有那么热闹了，""大阪府观光振兴组课长津田诚说。他表示，在疫情之前，该市近一半的外国游客来自中国。"
"Japan is requiring visitors from China to provide a negative P.C.R. test before arriving and to take another test when they arrive. Mr. Tsuda said he expects to see more visitors from China, but perhaps not right away.",日本要求来自中国的游客在到达之前提供阴性核酸结果，并在到达时再次进行一次检测。津田说，他预计会有更多来自中国的游客，但可能不会马上到来。
"""I do think there is an additional hurdle compared with visitors from other countries, so it may not be a sudden burst of incoming tourists from China, but more gradual,"" Mr. Tsuda said.","""我确实认为，与来自其他国家的游客相比，来自中国的游客面临一个额外的障碍，所以可能不会突然激增，而是渐进的，""津田说。"
"Among those at Hong Kong International airport on Sunday was Yan Yan, a 55-year-old garment wholesaler who had traveled from South Carolina with her husband.",周日在香港国际机场，一名55岁的服装批发商严燕(音)和丈夫从南卡罗来纳州来到香港。
They waited patiently to check their luggage on a Xiamen Airlines flight to Tianjin as the lines in a packed departures hall inched forward.,出发大厅里，拥挤的队伍正一点一点向前推进，他们耐心地等待将行李托运到厦门航空飞往天津的航班上。
"She used to visit her parents in Tianjin every year. But this will be her first time home since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. Limited flights and abrupt cancellations, not to mention onerous quarantines and P.C.R. testing, had deterred her until now. One of her friends who had flown back to China had spent the entire trip between quarantine facilities.",她过去每年都去天津探视父母。但这将是她自2020年初大流行开始以来第一次回家。航班有限和突然取消，更不用说繁重的隔离和核酸测试措施一直让她望而却步。她的一个朋友飞回中国后，整个旅程都是在不同的隔离设施中度过的。
"""Now that the restrictions have loosened, it's much better,"" she said, adding that she was relieved to see her relatives after they had recovered from difficult bouts of Covid several weeks ago.","她说:""现在放开了，情况好多了。""她还说，看到亲戚几周前从艰难的新冠疫情中恢复过来，她感到如释重负。"
"""It will be a great new year to spend with family.""","""这次会和家人好好过一个春节。"""
"In early December, China suddenly reversed its ""zero Covid"" policy. That set off a wave of infections that has swept across the nation, overwhelming hospitals and funeral parlors.","去年12月初，中国突然逆转了其""新冠清零""政策。这引发了一波席卷全国的感染浪潮，医院和殡仪馆人满为患。"
"Two events this month could further inflame the already raging outbreak. On Sunday, the country will reopen to tourists, and visitors will no longer be required to quarantine upon arrival. A few weeks later, China will celebrate Lunar New Year, the country's biggest holiday typically the largest annual migration of people on the planet.",本月发生的两件事可能会进一步加剧已经肆虐的疫情。周日，中国将向游客重新开放，旅客在抵达时将不再被要求隔离。几周后，中国将迎来春节，这是该国最重要的节日，通常也意味着一年中全球规模最大的一次人口流动。
"For insight into the situation in China, I spoke with Keith Bradsher, The Times's Beijing bureau chief. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",为了深入了解中国的情况，我采访了《纽约时报》北京分社社长柏凯斯(Keith Bradsher)。为方便阅读，本文经过了编辑。
"For those who aren't familiar, what was life like in China before the restrictions were removed?",对不了解情况的人来说，在取消新冠限制之前，中国的生活是什么样的?
"Almost overnight, the rules changed on Dec. 7. Until then, people were at constant risk of being sealed in a hospital room for weeks if they caught a Covid infection. Until Dec. 7, people who even went to the same shop or eatery as someone who later turned out to be infected, or even passed an infected person on the street, could end up being taken away to a quarantine center for a prolonged stay, sometimes with meager food and sanitation, or sealed in their homes.",12月7日，规定几乎是在一夜之间改变的。在那之前，若是感染新冠，就会面临被封锁在病房里数周的风险。在12月7日之前，哪怕是与后来被确诊阳性的人去过同一家商店或餐馆，或者甚至只是在街上与感染者擦肩而过，都有可能被带到隔离中心关上很久，那里的饮食和卫生条件有时很差，要么就被封锁在家中。
"In big cities like Beijing or Shanghai or Shenzhen, it became necessary to line up every two or three days and sometimes daily at sidewalk booths for P.C.R. tests, all tracked by the health codes on our cellphones.",在北京、上海或深圳这样的大城市，每隔两三天、有时甚至每天都要在人行道上的岗亭排队做核酸，所有检测都会被手机上的健康码记录下来。
"Because of the extreme sensitivity of the tests, an infected person could be kept in isolation for weeks or even months. And even after people left quarantine they could face permanent discrimination. There were some places that you weren't allowed to go if you ever had Covid, like some government offices.",由于核酸检测极其灵敏，感染者可能被隔离数周乃至数月之久。即便结束隔离，也可能面临永久的歧视。一些诸如政府办公室的场所是不允许得过新冠的人进入的。
So what do things look like now?,现在情况如何了?
"After Dec. 7, life was transformed. The good news was that we could suddenly move around without worrying about being locked up in a hospital or quarantine center. But the cost in illness and death has been high.",12月7日之后，生活彻底变了。好消息是，我们一下子都能四处活动，不用再担心被关进医院或隔离中心。但疾病和死亡的代价是很大的。
We went from medics being responsible for detaining people to suddenly caring for a lot of sick people. We've gone from funeral homes allowing lengthy services for as many as 100 guests to lacking adequate cremation capacity and barely allowing immediate family members to say goodbye.,医务人员从负责扣押民众突然变成了要救治大量病患。以往能让上百名客户举办长时间葬礼的殡仪馆，现在没有足够的火化能力，连直系亲属都很难有机会与遗体道别。
"We've seen hospitals practically overflowing, with little space left for more sick people. There's an acute shortage of ventilators. There is an acute shortage of ibuprofen. Even hospitals don't have enough ibuprofen to bring down the fevers of the very sick.",医院基本都人满为患，几乎没有空间容纳更多病人。呼吸机严重短缺。布洛芬严重短缺。哪怕是医院也没有足够的布洛芬为症状严重的患者退烧。
"All of these are scenes that were witnessed in the West when the pandemic first emerged in early 2020. But in China, it has been a surprise that there were not more preparations for the change in direction.",2020年初疫情刚出现时，西方国家都经历过这些情况。但令人惊讶的是，中国没有做更多的准备来应对政策方向的转变。
What do you mean?,你的意思是?
"The vaccination program nearly ground to a halt in late spring without ever reaching many of the country's older adults, who tended to resist vaccination. Many thought they could hide indefinitely from the virus. Their faith in China's vaccine industry had also been damaged by vaccine scandals before the pandemic, even though there is no evidence of safety problems for the Covid vaccines.",疫苗接种在春季末就接近停滞，许多老年人根本没打上，他们往往也抵制疫苗。许多人以为自己能永远躲避病毒。虽然没有证据表明新冠疫苗存在安全问题，但他们对中国疫苗行业的信心已经因疫情前的疫苗丑闻受损。
"The spread of the virus is extraordinary because not only do you have a population with almost zero past exposure or immunity, but now in a policy about-face you have towns encouraging people to come to work even if they are positive for Covid, as long as they are not especially feverish. I've been talking to companies in northern China, and some have told me that anywhere from 80 to 100 percent of their staff members have been infected.",病毒的传播速度惊人，因为不仅这里的人口过去几乎没有接触过病毒或得到免疫，而且现在政策的急转弯还让一些城镇鼓励民众哪怕感染了也要出来工作，只要发烧不是特别严重就行。我采访过中国北方的企业，有些企业告诉我，他们80%到100%的员工都被感染了。
Why did China change its policy so quickly?,中国政策的改变为何如此迅速?
"China faced several big challenges. There was mounting domestic unhappiness with the burden of quarantine and frequent testing, which resulted in street protests. China was also losing control of the virus even before the policy change on Dec. 7. The death rate began to spike upwards right after the loosening of restrictions, even though it takes the virus a couple weeks to reach the fatal phase. The immediate jump in activity at funeral homes suggested that there were a lot more people who were infected right before the policy change but were hiding at home.",中国面临了几大挑战。国内对隔离和频繁检测所造成的负担愈发不满，导致街头抗议爆发。早在12月7日政策改变前，中国也已经失去了对病毒的控制。尽管病毒需要数周的传播才能达到致命阶段，但在放松限制后，死亡率立刻开始飙升。殡仪馆工作量的迅速增加表明，在政策改变之前就有更多人被感染，但他们都躲在家里。
"Finally, the economy was in terrible shape through the autumn because people in China stopped going out to shop or to restaurants for fear of being infected. At the same time, overseas demand for goods from China was withering.",最后，整个秋季的经济状况都非常糟糕，因为害怕被感染的中国人都停止外出购物或就餐。与此同时，海外对中国产品的需求正在萎缩。
How are the Chinese people feeling?,中国人民的感受如何?
"Absolutely everyone seems to know some elderly person about whom he or she is deeply worried right now because the threat of serious illness from Covid increases with age. The country is experiencing a terrifying surge, and yet cities are encouraging travel for Lunar New Year, which starts in less than three weeks. We will likely see surges in rural areas, where many of the residents are elderly.",基本每个人似乎都认识一些让他们现在非常担心的老人，因为新冠重症疾病的威胁与年龄成正比。中国正在经历可怕的感染新增，但城市都在鼓励民众在三周内即将到来的春节出游。我们可能会看到农村地区的感染激增，那里的许多居民都是老年人。
What would a rural surge look like?,农村感染浪潮会是什么样?
"There was a study back in 2007 by the agriculture ministry which surveyed 3,000 villages. They found that in 90 percent of those villages, there were essentially no able-bodied people between the ages of 16 and 40 who had stayed. Almost all had gone to the cities to find jobs. So rural areas often have lots of grandparents raising grandchildren while the middle generation works in the cities. The fear is that just as the virus has raced through the population in Chinese cities, it will now race through Chinese villages in the next several weeks.",农业部在2007年做过一项针对3000个村庄的调查。他们发现，九成村庄里16岁到40岁之间身体健全的人口基本都没有留下。几乎所有人都去城市找工作了。因此，农村地区通常有很多照料孙辈的老人，而中间的一代则在城市工作。令人担忧的是，就像病毒在中国城市人口中迅速传播一样，它未来几周将在中国农村蔓延。
"The other scary part in all of this is that this is the first wave, and it's mostly being driven by earlier versions of Omicron. So people in China are acquiring resistance to Omicron subvariants that are already fading away globally. As China reopens its borders in the coming weeks, there is a possibility that the latest immune-evading subvariants may come next, as they have already become prevalent in parts of the United States. If that happens, residents may face further illness instead of a hoped-for single wave that quickly disappears.",另一个可怕之处在于，这第一波感染主要是由奥密克戎早期变异株带来的。因此，中国人能够抵御的奥密克戎亚种变异株在全球范围内已经逐渐消失。随着中国在未来几周重开边境，能够逃避免疫的最新亚型变异株可能会传播开来，就像它们已经在美国部分地区大肆传播一样。如果发生这种情况，中国居民可能会面临更多疾病，而不是他们所希望的只传一波就迅速结束的疫情。
What will China's reopening mean for the course of the pandemic?,中国重新开放对整个疫情的进程有怎样的影响?
It's unclear that this will cause new variants to emerge. Some scientists have said that what's happening in China is less likely to affect the rest of the world because it's basically exposing a low-immunity population to variants that have already circulated a lot globally.,尚不清楚这是否会导致新变异株的出现。有科学家宣称，中国的疫情不太可能影响全球，因为这基本上就是让一个低免疫人群接触到已经在全球广泛传播的变异株。
"I think the tragedy here is less of a global tragedy and more of a tragedy of China. It's a tragedy of the loss of so much of its older generation, which is now being sacrificed in a race to reopen and restart the economy quickly.",我认为，这里发生的悲剧与其说是全球性的，不如说是中国的悲剧。为了尽快重新开放和重启经济，牺牲了这么多老年人，这真的非常悲哀。
"The Chinese government on Tuesday denounced Covid testing requirements imposed by other countries on travelers arriving from China as unscientific or ""excessive,"" and threatened to take countermeasures.","中国政府周二谴责其他国家对来自中国的旅客实施的新冠检测要求不科学或""过度""，并威胁采取反制措施。"
"As China prepares to open its borders later this week, allowing its citizens to travel abroad for the first time since the pandemic began, countries like Canada, the United States, France, Spain, Japan and the United Kingdom have moved to restrict travelers arriving from the country.",中国准备在本周晚些时候开放边境，自疫情开始以来首次允许公民出国旅行，加拿大、美国、法国、西班牙、日本和英国等国家已采取行动，限制来自中国的旅客。
"The countries have cited concerns about a surge in Covid-19 infections in China, the potential risk of variants emerging from its outbreak and the government's perceived reluctance to share coronavirus data with other countries. The restrictions include requiring a negative Covid test or mandatory testing upon arrival.",这些国家对中国新冠感染激增表示关切，担心暴发有可能导致变异株的出现，并认为中国政府不愿与其他国家分享新冠病毒数据。采取的限制举措包括要求在抵达时出示新冠阴性结果或进行强制检测。
"In response, Chinese officials have accused the countries of introducing the restrictions for political reasons, imposing requirements on Chinese travelers that are not applied to others.",作为回应，中国官员指责这些国家出于政治原因实施限制，要求仅针对中国旅客。
"""Some countries have no scientific basis for restricting entries from China, and some excessive practices are even more unacceptable,"" said Mao Ning, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, speaking at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday.","外交部发言人毛宁周二在北京举行的新闻发布会上说:""部分国家采取仅针对中国的入境限制措施缺乏科学依据，一些过度做法更让人不能接受。"""
"""We firmly oppose the practice of manipulating Covid prevention and control measures to achieve political goals, and will take corresponding measures in accordance with the principle of reciprocity according to different situations,"" Ms. Mao said. She did not elaborate.","毛宁说:""我们对试图操弄疫情防控措施以达到政治目的的做法表示坚决反对，将针对不同情况本着对等原则采取相应措施。""她没有详细说明。"
"Even after China eases its travel restrictions, the government will still require incoming travelers to show a negative result on a polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., test, taken within 48 hours before departure.",即使在中国放宽旅行限制之后，政府仍将要求入境旅客出示在出发前48小时内进行的核酸阴性结果。
"Many health experts have said, however, that travel restrictions would not stop new variants just as earlier bans on international travel did very little to stop the spread of the Omicron variant.",然而，许多卫生专家表示，旅行限制不会阻止新的病毒变种出现——正如早期的国际旅行禁令那样，对阻止奥密克戎变种病毒的传播收效甚微。
"China is dealing with a surge of Covid cases after the government abruptly abandoned a ""zero Covid"" pandemic strategy that helped to keep the virus at bay within its borders for nearly three years. The government in December dismantled a sprawling testing apparatus that required residents to test regularly, and scrapped its strategy of lockdowns and grueling quarantine that applied not just to those who tested positive but also their contacts.","在突然放弃""清零""政策后，中国正在应对新冠病例激增的情况，该策略在过去三年里帮助将病毒控制在边境外。去年12月，政府取消了定期的大规模核酸检测要求，以及对阳性患者和密接的封锁和严格隔离政策。"
"This Sunday, for the first time since early 2020, shortly after Covid-19 first appeared in China, the government will drop quarantine rules for visitors to China from abroad and ease restrictions on incoming flights.",本周日，政府将取消对来自境外游客的隔离规定，并放宽对入境航班的限制。这是自2020年初新冠第一次出现在中国以来的首次。
"It has also restarted processing passport applications by Chinese citizens for tourism abroad. Outbound flight bookings surged by nearly 300 percent on Dec. 27 when the government announced the changes to its border restrictions, as many people began to plan trips abroad to see family and simply travel, according to data from Trip.com Group, a travel-booking company.",政府还重新开始办理中国公民出国旅游的护照申请。旅行预订公司携程的数据显示，12月27日，当政府宣布改变边境限制后，许多人开始计划出国看望家人和旅游，出境航班预订量激增近300%。
Many countries that had long depended on Chinese tourists before the pandemic are now struggling to balance the economic prospect of a flood of Chinese tourism with health concerns over the outbreak in China.,现在，面对大量中国游客带来的经济前景与对中国疫情暴发的健康担忧，许多在疫情之前长期依赖中国游客的国家都在艰难寻找平衡。
"A group of officials from European Union countries, known as the Health Security Committee, which has been a key source of advice for the bloc's Covid-era travel policies, suggested Tuesday that testing travelers from China for Covid before they board Europe-bound flights would be sensible, a top E.U. official said on Twitter.",一直以来，由来自欧盟国家的官员组成的卫生安全委员会是欧盟在新冠时代旅行政策的主要建议来源。一名欧盟高级官员在Twitter上表示，该委员会周二认为，在来自中国的旅客登上飞往欧洲的航班之前对他们进行新冠检测将是明智之举。
"The European Union is expected on Wednesday to offer its 27 member states, many of which are popular destinations for Chinese tourists, nonbinding advice on how to address travelers from China.",预计欧盟将于周三向其27个成员国提供关于如何应对来自中国游客的非约束性建议，其中许多成员国是中国游客的热门目的地。
"But each of the E.U. nations is free to set its own rules, and Stella Kyriakides, the European health commissioner, made an implicit plea on Twitter to E.U. nations not to adopt clashing policies that could undermine public health and create logistical chaos for travelers from China.",但每个欧盟国家可以自由制定自己的规则，欧洲卫生专员斯特拉·基里亚基德斯在Twitter上含蓄地呼吁，欧盟国家不要采取可能破坏公共卫生并给来自中国的旅客造成旅程混乱的冲突政策。
"""Unity remains our strongest tool against Covid,"" she wrote.","""团结仍然是我们对抗新冠的最强大工具，""她写道。"
But some European countries have begun putting in place restrictions for visitors from China without waiting for E.U. guidance.,但一些欧洲国家没有等待欧盟的指南，已经开始对来自中国的游客实施限制。
"Italy's Lombardy region, which includes Milan, last week began screening travelers arriving from China a policy that was soon adopted throughout Italy.",上周，包括米兰在内的意大利伦巴第大区开始对来自中国的旅客进行筛查——这一政策很快被整个意大利采用。
"More than half of the 120 passengers arriving in Italy on a flight from Wenzhou, China, on Dec. 26 were positive for the virus on P.C.R. tests. On another flight that landed on Dec. 29 from Tianjin, China, nearly half 26 of 56 passengers tested positive.",12月26日从中国温州乘飞机抵达意大利的120名乘客中，核酸检测呈阳性者超过半数。在12月29日来自中国天津的另一架航班上，近一半乘客——56人中的26人——检测呈阳性。
"The E.U. health agency, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said Tuesday that reported infections in China had been falling since an all-time high recorded on Dec. 2, ""likely also due to a lower number of tests being carried out, resulting in fewer infections being detected.""","欧盟卫生机构欧洲疾病预防控制中心周二表示，中国据报感染病例数自12月2日创下历史新高以来一直在下降，""这也可能是由于进行的检测数量减少，导致检测到的感染更少。"""
"""There continues to be a lack of reliable data on Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions, deaths as well as Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacity and occupancy in China,"" the E.C.D.C. said.","欧洲疾控中心表示:""中国仍然缺乏有关新冠病例、住院、死亡以及重症监护病房床位和占用率的可靠数据。"""
"But the agency noted that no new variants had been recorded in China so far, and E.U. citizens had high levels of immunity and vaccination against the known variants circulating, meaning that the boom in China's infections was ""not challenging for the immune response of"" people in Europe.","但该机构指出，迄今为止中国没有记录到新的变种，欧盟公民对已知流行的变种具有高水平的免疫力以及高接种率，这意味着中国感染的激增""不会对欧洲民众的免疫反应构成挑战""。"
"China has stopped regularly reporting daily cases, and many scientists have raised concerns about the opacity of its reporting of severe cases and Covid-related deaths. Some health experts have also cited fears that the sheer volume of cases could mean that the virus will mutate into new and more dangerous variants. There is no indication of this yet, and many scientists are skeptical of such a scenario happening in the coming weeks.",中国已停止定期报告每日病例，许多科学家对于中国在报告重症病例和新冠相关死亡病例上的不透明表示关切。一些卫生专家还对病例数量之多感到担心，这可能意味着病毒会变异成新的、更危险的变种。目前还没有任何迹象表明这种情况，许多科学家对它会在几周内发生持怀疑态度。
"Officially, China reported just 4,804 local cases and three deaths on Monday in its latest disclosure, but several cities have reported estimates of half a million or more daily cases. Health officials in Zhejiang said the coastal province is recording a million cases each day, adding that they expected the outbreak there to peak sometime later this month.",据官方统计，中国周一在其最新披露中仅报告了4804例本地病例和三例死亡病例，但一些城市报告估计每日新增病例超过50万。浙江省卫生官员表示，该省份每天录得100万例病例，并且预计当地疫情将在本月晚些时候达到峰值。
"""With the adjustment of international travel policy, the risk of imported new strains and the risk of domestic transmission will also be significantly increased,"" the Zhejiang provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a notice published on Tuesday.","""随着入境政策的调整，境外输入新变异株的风险以及引起本土传播的风险也将显著上升，""浙江省疾病预防控制中心在周二发布的一份通知中说。"
"China's state-controlled media has accused the United States and European countries of applying a ""double standard"" to China and of using restrictions as a ""political card.""","中国官方媒体指责美国和欧洲国家对中国实行""双标""，将防疫当作""政治牌""打。"
"""It seems that, according to the political logic of some people in Europe and the United States, no matter if China 'opens up' or 'doesn't open up,' what it does is wrong,"" read one commentary by China's state broadcaster, CCTV.","官方的中央电视台在一篇评论写道:""看来，在欧美一些人的政治逻辑里，无论中国""放开""或是""不放开""，怎么做都不对。"""
"Three weeks after Xi Jinping, China's top leader, tried to reinvigorate China's stalled economy by abruptly abandoning his stringent pandemic restrictions, he struck an upbeat note in his annual New Year's Eve address. ""China's economy has strong resilience, great potential and vitality,"" he said.","在试图通过突然放弃严格的新冠防控措施来重振停滞的经济三周后，中国最高领导人习近平在新年贺词中表达了乐观的态度。他说:""中国经济韧性强、潜力大、活力足。"""
"But that optimism is hard to find in downtown Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southern China. Nearly three years of ""zero Covid"" measures have crushed businesses. Streets are lined with shuttered stores and workshops. Walls are plastered not with ""help wanted"" signs, but with notices from entrepreneurs putting their businesses up for sale. Roads and alleys once packed with migrant workers are now mostly empty.","但这种乐观情绪在中国南方的商业中心广州的闹市区很难找到。近三年的""清零""措施摧毁了商业。街道两旁的商店和作坊关闭了。墙上贴的不是招聘启示，而是店面出售的通知。曾经挤满外来务工者的马路和小巷现在大多空无一人。"
"China's reversal of its Covid restrictions in early December was meant to help places like Guangzhou. But the chaotic approach has contributed to a tsunami of infections that has swept across the nation, overwhelming hospitals and funeral parlors. In many industries, truck drivers and other workers have quickly fallen ill, temporarily stretching staff and slowing operations.",中国在12月初取消了对新冠的防控措施，就是为了帮助像广州这样的地方。但混乱的做法导致感染海啸席卷全国，医院和殡仪馆不堪重负。在许多行业，卡车司机和其他工人很快染病，导致短时间内人手短缺，业务无法正常运转。
"Now, faced with an unpredictable and uncontrolled epidemic and financial uncertainty, people and companies are spending cautiously, suggesting that the road to recovery will be uneven and painful.",现在，面对难以预测且不受控制的疫情以及金融的不确定性，个人和企业都在支出方面保持谨慎，这表明复苏之路将是崎岖且痛苦的。
"China is also confronting broader challenges beyond its borders. The global economy is slowing, dragged down by high inflation, an energy crisis and geopolitical turmoil. As American and European shoppers tighten their budgets, China increasingly faces a double blow of slumping demand both at home and abroad.",中国在国外还面临着更广泛的挑战。受高通胀、能源危机和地缘政治动荡的拖累，全球经济正在放缓。随着美国和欧洲购物者收紧预算，中国日益面临国内外需求下滑的双重打击。
Weak spending is further depressing the already razor-thin or nonexistent profit margins of many of the small private businesses that power China's economy.,为中国经济提供动力的许多民营小企业的利润率本已十分微薄或毫无利润空间，而疲软的支出进一步将其压低。
"In Guangzhou, Tony Tang, the owner of a fifth-floor workshop that makes women's clothing, said his sales had plunged by two-thirds in the past year. Competition among small factories in China and overseas is fierce, pushing down the wholesale price he can charge for a woman's jacket with no brand name from $14 to $11.30 apiece.",广州一家位于五楼的女装作坊的老板托尼·唐说，去年他的销售额下降了三分之二。海内外的小工厂之间竞争非常激烈，他将一件没有品牌的女式夹克的批发价从每件100元压低至79元。
"Mr. Tang's work force has shrunk from 30 to 10, but there is no shortage of labor. When he needed a worker to help sew an order of halter tops, he went out on a street corner with a handmade cardboard sign and hired one within several minutes, for one-sixth less than he paid about a year ago.",唐先生雇佣的劳动力从30人缩减到10人，但劳动力并不短缺。当他需要一名工人帮忙缝制一批露背上衣订单时，他举着手写纸板招牌走到街角，几分钟内就招到了一名工人，价格比他大约一年前给出的工资低六分之一。
"The problem, Mr. Tang said, is a lack of orders. His workshop has ""a lot of workers, but we don't have work to do,"" he said.","唐先生说，问题在于没有订单。他的作坊""有很多工人，但我们没有工作可做""，他说。"
"China's factory activity contracted further in December as rapidly spreading infections grounded workers, snarled deliveries and dampened demand, according to a survey of manufacturers that the government released on Saturday. For service industries like restaurants, the same survey found, business was almost as bad as in early 2020, during the nearly nationwide lockdown that followed the first Covid outbreak in the city of Wuhan. Eateries and other businesses closed last month as customers stayed home to avoid infection or because they were sick.",政府周六公布的一项对制造商的调查显示，由于迅速蔓延的感染导致工人停工、交货中断和需求下降，中国的工厂活动在12月进一步收缩。同一项调查发现，餐馆等服务行业生意糟糕，几乎就像2020年初武汉市首次暴发新冠疫情时那样，当时几乎全国都处于封锁状态。上个月，由于顾客生病在家或为了避免感染而居家，餐馆和其他企业都歇业了。
"""The epidemic has had a great impact on the production and demand of enterprises, the attendance of personnel, and logistics and distribution,"" the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement that accompanied its release of the survey data.","国家统计局在发布调查数据的同时发表声明称:""疫情对企业产需、人员到岗、物流配送带来较大影响。"""
"Manufacturing had already been in decline in November, when many cities and regions in China imposed lockdowns on residents in a futile bid to contain outbreaks. Car dealerships are crammed with unsold cars. Stores have little need to order more for their shelves when they are already full of unsold merchandise.",制造业在11月就已经出现下滑，当时中国的许多城市和地区都采取了封锁措施，徒劳地遏制疫情暴发。汽车经销商处停满了未售出的汽车。商店货架上摆满了未售出的商品，无需进货。
"Nio, an electric car manufacturer in east-central China's Anhui Province, said that Covid outbreaks had affected its supply chain and reduced its car deliveries in December. Tesla suspended the production of cars at its factory in Shanghai for the last week of December, a move that Yale Zhang, managing director of Automotive Foresight, a consultancy in Shanghai, saw as a sign of flagging sales in China and elsewhere, partly because other automakers are introducing more electric cars.",中国中东部安徽省的电动汽车制造商蔚来汽车表示，新冠疫情影响了它的供应链，导致12月汽车交付量的减少。特斯拉在12月的最后一周暂停了其上海工厂的汽车生产，上海咨询公司Automotive Foresight的总经理耶鲁·张认为，此举是特斯拉在中国和其他地方销售下滑的迹象，在一定程度上也是因为其他汽车制造商正在推出更多的电动汽车。
"But even as many cities and provinces are in the throes of deadly outbreaks that have silenced once-busy streets, in other places, there are early signs that economic activity is resuming. In a few cities in northern China like Beijing, which saw widespread outbreaks that have since peaked, people have been going out again in recent days.",但是，尽管许多城市和省份正处于致命疫情的挣扎之下，一度繁忙的街道变得安静，但在另外一些地方，有迹象表明经济活动正在恢复。在北京等中国北方的几个城市，疫情已大范围暴发并达到峰值，最近几天人们又开始外出。
The lifting of quarantine rules has helped drive sales of airline tickets ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday later this month. The removal of onerous Covid restrictions like daily P.C.R. testing on people and imported goods has saved time and money for companies and workers.,本月晚些时候将迎来春节假期，取消隔离规定帮助推动了机票销售。诸如每天对人员和进口商品做核酸等繁琐新冠限制的取消，也为企业和工人节省了时间和金钱。
"Xu Zeqiang, a truck driver in Yangjiang, a city in southeastern China that is a hub of knife and scissors production, said that he and his driving partner could now complete a round trip from Yangjiang to the ports at Shenzhen, 200 miles away, in a day, instead of two or three days.",阳江是中国东南部的刀具和剪刀生产中心，这里一名叫徐泽强(音)的卡车司机表示，他与合伙司机现在能在一天内往返阳江和约320公里外的深圳港口，以前则需要两三天。
"""In the past, we could be stopped for P.C.R. test results and health code checks now, it's not required anymore, you can come and leave any time,"" he said.","""因为以前要核酸、绿码，被很多东西卡住了，现在没有就可以随时进、随时出，""他说。"
"Many European manufacturers in China have been forced to operate with about half their usual staff for two to three weeks, affecting output somewhat, said Klaus Zenkel, the chairman of the chamber's South China chapter. As a precaution against lockdowns, many companies had accumulated spare parts in warehouses before the Covid wave and have relied on those to keep running.",中国欧盟商会华南区分会主席高志豪(Klaus Zenkel)表示，许多在华欧洲制造商这两三周的运营人手只剩下正常情况的约一半，这在一定程度上影响了产量。之前为了预防封锁，许多企业在疫情暴发前就在仓库囤积了备件，并依靠这些库存维持运营。
"But to save on costs, a few small suppliers of specific components have stopped operations early for the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts on Jan. 21. ""Everyone managed a way to continue somehow, to keep the damage at a minimum,"" Mr. Zenkel said.","但为了节省成本，一些特定部件的小型供应商已经在1月21日的春节假期到来前提早停止运营。""每家企业都在设法维持运营，把损害降到最低，""高志豪说。"
"The damage that ""zero Covid"" inflicted on China's once-unbeatable attractiveness as a manufacturing hub could be hard to repair.","中国作为制造业中心曾拥有无与伦比的吸引力，""新冠清零""对此造成的损害可能难以修复。"
"Lockdowns and closed borders slowed or disrupted deliveries of goods and prevented many companies from sending buyers to factories. Some global retailers, seeing risk in overreliance on China, have turned instead to other countries for supplies. Walmart, for example, plans to ramp up imports from India to $10 billion a year by 2027.",封锁和边境关闭延缓或中断了货物交付，并导致许多企业无法向工厂派出采购人员。一些全球零售商看到了过度依赖中国的风险，转而向其他国家寻求供货。例如，沃尔玛计划到2027年将从印度的进口增加到每年100亿美元。
Even Chinese exporters are trying to diversify.,就连中国的出口商也在努力分散风险。
"In Yangjiang, Velong Enterprises, a Chinese manufacturer of knives, grilling thermometers and other kitchenware for Walmart, Ikea, Target, Carrefour and other retailers, is expanding its operations in Cambodia, Vietnam and India. It has shrunk its work force in Yangjiang from 1,700 to 1,200 through attrition and is considering potential factory sites from Mexico to Turkey, said Jacob Rothman, a co-founder and co-chief executive.",在阳江，为沃尔玛、宜家、目标百货、家乐福和其他零售商生产刀具、烧烤温度计和其他厨具的中国制造商汇隆实业正在扩大其在柬埔寨、越南和印度的业务。联合创始人兼联合首席执行官雅各布·罗斯曼表示，该公司已在阳江裁员，将那里的员工数量从1700人减少到1200人，也正在考虑包括墨西哥和土耳其在内的潜在工厂选址。
Companies like Velong find some savings when they venture out. The company pays workers in Cambodia half as much as its workers in Yangjiang.,像汇隆实业这样的企业若向海外发展，还能节省一些成本。该公司给柬埔寨工人的工资是阳江工人的一半。
"But China's strengths in industrial prowess and labor, even in the midst of a raging epidemic, are hard to beat.",但即便疫情肆虐，中国在产业实力和劳动力方面的优势仍然难以匹敌。
"A fifth of Velong's remaining factory workers in China are now out sick. But the company has been able to avoid missing deliveries by hiring temporary workers from among the large pool of workers in Yangjiang with knife-making experience, said Iven Chen, the company's other co-founder and co-chief executive.",汇隆实业在中国工厂留下来的工人当中，如今有五分之一都在休病假。但该公司另一位联合创始人兼联合首席执行官伊文·陈(音)表示，该公司从阳江大量有制刀经验的工人中雇佣了临时工，因而得以避免交付延误。
"""Our employees can be trained in five to eight days, and the skilled ones need less than one day,"" said Ye Yuanqiang, a factory production manager at Velong. ""I have worked in Cambodia, and sometimes I can't train them well in two months.""","""我们这里的员工五到八天就可以培训，熟练的一天都不用，""在汇隆担任工厂生产经理的叶远强(音)说。""我在柬埔寨工作过，有时候两个月都培养不好。"""
"The pressure on exporters has only intensified in recent months. China's exports fell in November compared to a year earlier, led by a 25 percent plunge in exports to the United States. Households in the West had spent heavily on exercise equipment and other manufactured goods from China during the first two years of the pandemic, but are now more budget-conscious as prices rise.",近几个月来，出口商的压力只增不减。中国11月的出口与去年同期相比有所下降，对美出口降幅最大，达到25%。在疫情前两年，西方家庭购买了大量中国制造的健身器材和其他制成品，但随着价格上涨，他们也开始精打细算。
"The Communist Party has pledged to spur domestic demand to revive growth. But convincing people to spend after three years of stop-start activity and punishing lockdowns will be tough. Many Chinese workers are now looking for ways to rebuild their savings, even as the Lunar New Year holiday approaches, a time when families used to splurge.",中共承诺将通过刺激内需重振经济增长。但在经历了三年断断续续的经济活动和惩罚性的封锁之后，很难说服民众进行消费。虽然春节将近，以往这是中国家庭大肆消费的时节，但许多中国工人如今都在寻求重新增加储蓄。
"""The overall wages are quite low, you can't make much money,"" said Gong Shuguang, a garment worker in Guangzhou who plans to stay in the city for the holiday instead of returning to his hometown in Sichuan Province for a family reunion. He lost two months' wages during a Covid lockdown in the autumn.","""总体工资很低，赚不了多少钱，""广州的服装工人龚曙光(音)说，他打算留在广州过年，不回四川老家与亲人团聚。在秋天的新冠封锁期间，他损失了两个月的工资。"
"""I want to find more work to do,"" he said late last month. ""I have worked here for seven or eight years and this year is the worst.""","""想多找点事做，""他上个月底说。""我在这七八年了，今年最差。"""
"In Beijing and cities across China, as many as 2.6 million job applicants, including graduates from the country's top universities, will report to testing centers in early January to face exceedingly long odds and compete for 37,100 entry-level government jobs.",在北京和中国各地的城市，多达260万求职者(其中包括来自全国顶尖大学的毕业生)将在1月初向考试中心报到。这些求职者将以悬殊比例竞争37100个初级政府职位。
"The national exam is an annual rite for young Chinese, some of whom spend thousands of dollars for prep classes and many hours cramming for it. It comes at a fraught time. It was supposed to be given in early December, then was canceled at the last minute. The government cited Covid-19 lockdowns, but the exam was postponed days after protests in more than a dozen cities against China's severe pandemic restrictions.",对许多中国年轻人来说，国考是一年一度的大事情，有的人花不少钱参加备考班，花很多时间来突击准备。而现在是一个令人忧虑的时刻。原定于12月初举行的考试在最后一刻取消了。政府援引新冠封锁措施为由，但在考试被推迟的前几天，十几个城市爆发了反对中国严厉新冠措施的抗议。
"Jobs in China's vast Civil Service have long been considered prestigious launching pads for a career. They include entry-level roles typical in any economy, like clerks in municipal government, and some that are unique to China, such as assisting in the country's extensive censorship bureaucracy.",中国的公务员是一支庞大的队伍，长期以来，公务员一直被视为职业生涯中备受仰视的跳板。这些职位包括在任何经济体中都常见的入门级职位，如市政府的文员，以及一些中国独有的职位，如该国广泛的审查官僚机构的助理工作。
"But these days the jobs are also coveted out of necessity, because it's especially hard for new graduates to find employment at private companies.",但如今公务员职位令人垂涎也是出于必然，因为应届毕业生在民营企业找工作越来越难。
"Nearly one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in China are unemployed. Alibaba, Tencent and other tech firms have laid off workers. Economic growth has been battered by a sharp real estate slump, and small businesses suffered under the Covid restrictions, which paralyzed large parts of the country for weeks or months at a time. The ""zero Covid"" policy has been scrapped, but the economy is not expected to quickly snap back.","在中国16至24岁的人群中，近五分之一处于失业状态。阿里巴巴、腾讯和其他科技公司都进行了裁员。经济增长受到房地产市场急剧下滑的打击，小企业受到新冠防控措施的影响，该国大部分地区曾一度持续瘫痪数周或数月。""清零""政策现已被取消，但预计经济并不会迅速反弹。"
"""It's just that they don't have so many opportunities in the private sector,"" said Alfred Wu, a professor at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.","""他们在私营部门当中机会其实也没那么多了，""新加坡李光耀公共政策学院教授吴木銮说。"
"The competition for public service positions is so fierce that people often refer to them with a Chinese saying: ""thousands of troops crossing a single-plank bridge.""","公务员岗位竞争激烈，人们常将其形容为""千军万马过独木桥""。"
"The exam is rigorous. Test takers must answer about 130 multiple-choice questions covering topics like math, data analysis, science and economics. They are asked to write five essays of 200 to 1,000 words each on social issues and government policies. Scoring highly increases the chances of getting a job, although getting hired means enduring a battery of interviews, background checks and other reviews.",这是一个严格的考试。考生必须回答大约130道多项选择题，涵盖数学、数据分析、科学和经济学等科目。他们要写五篇关于社会问题和政府政策的文章，每篇200到1000字不等。得高分会增加找到工作的机会，虽然在录用前还要经历一连串的面试、背景调查和其他审查。
"Then there's the reality of Civil Service work. Some say their days are ruled by rigid hierarchies and involve monotonous chores. Others, while saying they enjoy their jobs, complain that their responsibilities often sprawl beyond normal work hours. The role they had to play enforcing China's zero-tolerance approach to Covid the past three years was a sore spot.","然后是公务员工作的现实。有人说他们的日子被严格的等级制度所统治，做的是单调的杂事。也有人说他们喜欢自己的工作，但抱怨经常要加班加点。尤其是在过去三年中，不得不承担新冠""清零""政策的执行角色，成为他们的一大痛点。"
"Amy Liu, who has served as a clerk in Beijing's municipal government for the past six years, said she mostly enjoyed her work, learned a lot from it and found her days satisfying.",过去六年在北京市政府担任文员的艾米·刘说，她大多数时候喜欢自己的工作，从中学到了很多东西，觉得日子过得很充实。
"But in the last few years, she has been dragged into the ""zero Covid"" campaign. Like everyone in her department, she was required to volunteer at virus testing sites once a week when there were a high number of cases. She was instructed to stand guard and keep crowds in line.","但在过去几年里，她被卷入了""清零""运动。和她部门的每个人一样，当病例增多的时候，她被要求每周一次在核酸检测点做志愿者。她被指示站岗，维持队伍秩序。"
"""This type of thing irritates me so much,"" Ms. Liu said.","""做这些事会让我觉得就很烦，""刘女士说。"
"This was in addition to other required tasks unrelated to her job, such as study sessions about Communist Party history, ideology lessons organized by the propaganda department, and tutorials about law and discipline from the anticorruption department. These topics have taken on greater importance throughout China since Xi Jinping took power in 2012.",除此之外，还有一些与工作无关的任务，比如党史学习、宣传部门组织的意识形态课、反腐部门的法纪辅导班。自习近平2012年上台以来，这些内容在整个中国都越来越重要。
"Working in public service has a rich history in modern China. Government jobs were once prized an earlier generation referred to them as ""iron rice bowls"" because of their stability. They offered security and regular work hours. But after the Chinese economy started to open up, many young people chose instead to pursue the riches and opportunities available in the private sector.","从事公务员工作在现代中国有着悠久的历史。政府工作曾经很受重视——因为稳定，上一代人称之为""铁饭碗""。公务员工作提供安全保障和固定的工作时间。但在中国经济开始开放后，许多年轻人转而选择在私企追求财富和机会。"
"That trend has reversed under Mr. Xi. The heavier hand of the state on parts of the economy like technology has made those private-sector jobs less attractive and harder to find, while also putting new burdens on Civil Service workers.",在习近平的领导下，这种趋势发生了逆转。国家对科技等经济领域的高压手段使这些私营部门的工作变得不那么有吸引力，也更难找到，同时也给公务员增加了新的负担。
"""The culture of the entire Chinese local government has changed, from encouraging the innovative economy and developing tourism to achieving the goal of political security and pleasing the supervisors,"" said Xiang Biao, a professor of social anthropology at Oxford University who focuses on Chinese society.","""整个的对中国地方政府的文化也变了，从创新经济、发展旅游逐渐变为政治安全，然后(以)讨好上级为目标，""专注于中国社会的牛津大学社会人类学教授项飙说。"
"These jobs have been particularly tough during the pandemic. China's rigid policies created a thicket of rules that civil servants had to enforce, and that made frontline workers ""punching bags"" and ""decompression valves,"" Liberation Daily, a Chinese Communist Party newspaper, stated in an April article during a lockdown in Shanghai that lasted two months.","这些工作在疫情期间变得尤其艰难。中国的僵硬政策导致公务员必须执行错综复杂的规则，正如中共党报《解放日报》4月在上海封城期间的一篇文章中指出，这让一线工作者成了""出气筒""和""减压阀""。那次封城持续了两个月。"
"Mr. Xi has said China needed to ease the burden on lower-level government workers by reducing ""formality for formality's sake and bureaucracy,"" noting how government departments in some cities force staff to complete paperwork that doesn't solve real problems. But it's not clear whether the relaxation of ""zero Covid"" will change the nature of the entry-level jobs, at least in ways that will make the work more appealing.","习近平曾表示，中国需要通过减少""形式主义和官僚主义""来减轻基层政府工作人员的负担，并指出一些城市的政府部门强迫工作人员去做并不能解决实际问题的文书工作。但目前尚不清楚""清零""政策的放宽是否会改变入门级工作的性质，至少是否会在某种程度上让这项工作更具吸引力。"
"It's a hard time for a young person to start a career in China. ""They know that the opportunities generated by China's rapid growth no longer belong to this generation,"" Mr. Wu, the China expert in Singapore, said. That frustration among many young people, he said, was expressed in the surge of protests that rocked China in November.","在中国，对于一个年轻人来说，现在进入职场是一个艰难的时刻。新加坡的中国问题专家吴木銮说:""因为他们知道中国的rapid growth(快速增长)产生的机会已经不属于这代人了。""吴木銮说，许多年轻人感受到的挫败感在11月震撼中国的抗议浪潮中得到了体现。"
"""Of course, the protests must have had something to do with Covid, but they also showed their desperate side,"" he added.","""Protests(抗议)当然跟covid(新冠)肯定有关系，但是也是显示他们绝望的一面吧。""他补充道。"
"Despite dissatisfaction with their work, some of the young civil servants said they felt trapped because there was no guarantee that they would find something better in the private sector. In addition, they said they often felt pressured by parents who value a stable job and revel in the status of a child working for the government.",一些年轻公务员表示他们感到左右为难，即便对自己的工作不满意，但不能保证自己在私企能找到更好的工作。此外，他们说经常感受到来自父母的压力，后者重视工作的稳定，并陶醉于孩子为公家做事的地位。
"""My parents think it's good to be a civil servant,"" Ms. Liu said. ""They think I should never leave.""","""比如说像我爸妈他们是特别觉得做公务员挺好的，""刘女士说。""并且认为我绝对不要出来的。"""
"Katherine Shi has a job that, at first, sounds alluring to many young graduates: She watches television for a living. Ms. Shi is a government censor who searches for vulgarity, politically sensitive content and other forbidden subjects on TV and in movies.",凯瑟琳·施的工作乍一看对许多年轻的毕业生来说很有吸引力:她的工作是看电视。施女士是一名政府审查员，负责在影视作品中搜索粗俗、政治敏感内容和其他禁忌话题。
"The job has become hard to bear, she said. Some days, she is asked to censor 100 hours of video and make sure nothing slips by. Even with watching videos at double speed, Ms. Shi said it was impossible to deal with the workload.",她说，这份工作已经变得难以忍受。有时，她被要求审查100个小时的视频，确保没有任何遗漏。施女士表示，即使是双倍速观看视频，也无法应对工作量。
"She often feels conflicted at work, she said, because there are many things that she does not find objectionable but that fall under censorship guidelines. She is ordered to censor an ever-growing list of content, such as videos about L.G.B.T.Q. people, tattoos or so-called ""lie flat"" values, a counterculture approach that has gained popularity in China for embracing a lack of ambition and wanting an easy, uncomplicated life. In a crime movie, censors need to make sure that criminals are always punished.","她在工作中经常感到矛盾，因为有很多事情她并不反感，但这些事情却属于审查制度的范畴。她被命令审查的内容越来越多，例如有关LGBTQ、文身或所谓的""躺平""价值观的视频。""躺平""是一种在中国流行的反文化态度，人们接纳不上进和想要轻松、简单生活的理念。在犯罪题材电影中，审查人员需要确认罪犯最终受到了惩罚。"
"""Culture should be very free, and you should allow the expressions of some so-called negative energy and the dark side of society because they truly exist,"" Ms. Shi said. She said she felt that some people in the government had closed their eyes to how the world really was.","""我是觉得文化就是应该很自由的，而且你应该允许一些所谓的负能量的社会阴暗面的表达，因为那个本身就是真实存在的，""施女士说。她说她觉得政府中的一些人对世界的真实情况视而不见。"
"""I was very distressed about this,"" she said, adding that she is considering quitting to study abroad.","她表示:""我非常的难受。""她还说正在考虑辞职出国留学。"
"As Covid barrels through China, scientists around the world are searching for clues about an outbreak with sprawling consequences for the health of hundreds of millions of Chinese people, the global economy and the future of the pandemic.",随着新冠疫情肆虐中国，全球各地的科学家都在寻找线索，探究这场疫情暴发对数亿中国人的健康、全球经济和疫情的未来发展将产生的深远影响。
"But in the absence of credible information from the Chinese government, it is a big scientific guessing game to determine the size and severity of the surge in the world's most populous country.",但在中国政府不提供可靠信息的情况下，要判断全球人口第一大国的疫情规模和严重程度，堪称一场大型科学猜谜游戏。
"In Hong Kong, one team of researchers pored over passenger data from five Beijing subway lines to determine the potential spread. In Seattle, a group of modelers tried in vain to reverse-engineer an unverified government leak detailing case numbers from Chinese health officials. In Britain, scientists are coming up with their own efficacy estimates of Chinese vaccines.",在香港，一个研究团队仔细研究了北京五条地铁线路的乘客数据，以确定潜在的传播范围。在西雅图，一个建模团队试图对一份未经证实的政府泄露文件——其中详细介绍了中国卫生官员提供的病例数量——进行逆推还原，但没有成功。在英国，科学家正在对中国疫苗的效力进行评估。
"Any personal anecdote or social media report from China scarce medicines, overrun hospitals, overflowing crematories is possible fodder for researchers' models.",任何来自中国的个人经历或社交媒体报告的情况——药品短缺、医院人满为患，火葬场不堪重负——都能给研究人员的模型提供依据。
They are all attempting to understand the same things: How quickly is the virus spreading in the country? How many people are dying? Could China be the source of a new and dangerous variant?,他们都在努力了解同一件事:病毒在中国传播的速度有多快?有多少人正在死去?中国可能出现某种新的危险变异株吗?
"As scientists sift through varied sources of shaky information, they are bracing for potentially catastrophic outcomes. Barring new precautionary steps, some worst-case estimates suggest that Covid could kill as many people in China in the next four months as it has Americans during the entire three-year pandemic.",随着科学家筛选各种不可靠的信息来源，他们正在为潜在灾难性后果做准备。除非采取新的预防措施，否则一些最坏情况的预估表明，未来四个月，新冠病毒在中国造成的死亡人数可能与美国在整个三年疫情期间的死亡人数相当。
"Without satisfying answers, some countries are putting limits on Chinese travelers, albeit based in part on unfounded fears or political motivations. The United States, Italy and Japan have said they will require a negative Covid test for those coming from China, citing concerns that the surge in cases in China could produce new, more threatening variants.",由于没有令人满意的答案，一些国家开始限制中国旅客入境，尽管部分决策是基于毫无根据的恐惧或政治动机。美国、意大利和日本表示，他们将要求来自中国的旅客提供新冠阴性检测结果，理由是担心中国感染激增可能会制造更可怕的新变异株。
"While researchers and virologists said the new measures would most likely do little, if anything, to blunt the spread, the policies reflect the limited visibility into the outbreak. Scientists' models generally point to an explosive spread and a high death rate, given how many people in China have little to no immunity to Omicron subvariants. But even their estimates are all over the place.",尽管研究人员和病毒学家表示，这些新措施很可能无助于遏制疫情传播，但这些政策反映了对疫情了解的有限。因为许多中国民众对奥密克戎亚型变异株几乎没有免疫力，科学家的模型往往都指向爆炸性的传播模式和高死亡率的结果。但即便是他们的估算也存在偏差。
"In the bleakest of several scenarios of what the end of China's ""zero Covid"" policy might mean, nearly a million people could die during the early months of reopening, Hong Kong researchers reported this month in a study partly funded by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, though the study does not provide an exact time period.","香港研究人员本月在一项由中国疾控中心部分资助的研究中报告称，中国结束""新冠清零""政策可能导致的几种情况中，最悲观的结果就是在重新开放的最初几个月造成近100万人死亡。不过，该研究没有提供确切时间节点。"
"An American group estimated as many as half a million deaths by April and another million by the end of 2023 if China rejects social-distancing mandates. Airfinity, a British-based analytics company, this week offered an even more dire short-term forecast: 1.7 million Covid deaths by the end of April.",一个美国组织估计，如果中国不做社交距离的强制要求，到4月将有多达50万人死亡，到2023年底还会有100万人死亡。总部位于英国的分析公司Airfinity本周给出了一个更可怕的短期预测:到4月底，新冠死亡人数将达到170万。
"Until this month, the world seemed to have a reasonably clear understanding of what was happening with the virus in China. The ruling Communist Party proudly published low daily case numbers and deaths as a testament to its stringent ""zero Covid"" policy. A countrywide system of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing largely kept the virus at bay.","直到本月，世界似乎对中国的病毒传播情况都还有相当清楚的认识。执政的共产党自豪地公布很少的每日感染和死亡数字，以此证明其严厉""新冠清零""政策的合理性。全国范围的封锁、隔离和大规模检测在很大程度上阻止了病毒的传播。"
"But in early December, the government abruptly abandoned ""zero Covid,"" leaving the scientific community largely in the dark.","但到12月初，政府突然放弃""新冠清零""，将科学界基本蒙在鼓里。"
"""Nobody, nobody has a clue,"" said Siddharth Sridhar, a clinical virologist with a focus on emerging infectious diseases.","""没有人，没有人能想到，""专注研究新发传染病的临床病毒学家薛达(Siddharth Sridhar)说。"
"Predicting the path of the pandemic has always been difficult. Even in places like Britain with reliable data, forecasts have often been far off the mark. But scientists have generally used reported Covid deaths as a dependable barometer to determine the potential size of an outbreak.",预测疫情传播路径一直很困难。即使在英国这样有可靠数据的地方，预测结果也常与实际相去甚远。但科学家通常将报告的新冠死亡数视为可靠标尺，来确定疫情的潜在规模。
"The data coming from the Chinese government can't be trusted anymore. Officially, China has claimed just 12 deaths from Covid since Dec. 1. The country has said it will only count those who die from respiratory failure directly linked to an infection, leaving out vast numbers who died because Covid aggravated underlying diseases or caused heart or liver failure.",来自中国政府的数据不再可信。据官方统计，自12月1日以来，中国仅公布了12例新冠死亡。该国表示，将只统计感染直接导致的呼吸衰竭死亡病例，不会包括大量因新冠导致基础疾病加重或心脏肝脏衰竭的死亡。
Experts say the sheer speed of the spread would suggest a much higher number of deaths. One city last week reported half a million cases in one day. Another reported a million.,专家表示，这种传播速度意味着死亡人数要高得多。上周一座城市报告了50万单日新增病例。另一座城市报告了100万。
There are also indications that officials are pressuring doctors and crematories to avoid categorizing even respiratory deaths as virus related.,还有迹象表明，官员正在对医生和殡仪馆施压，连与病毒相关的呼吸道死亡都不能被算为新冠死。
"One doctor at a private hospital in Beijing said he and his colleagues found a typed note on a hospital desk in recent days urging them to ""try not to write respiratory failure caused by Covid"" as the primary cause of death. The note was shared with The New York Times.","北京一家私立医院的一名医生说，最近几天，他和同事在医院桌上发现了一张打印好的便条，要求他们""尽量不要写重症新冠肺炎造成的呼吸衰竭""为主要死因。《纽约时报》查看了这张纸条。"
"The doctor said it was not clear if the message was generated internally or sent from government officials. But similar warnings have been circulating on Chinese social media telling doctors not to ""carelessly write Covid"" on death certificates.","这名医生说，目前还不清楚这条信息是内部发出的，还是政府官员发出的。但中国社交媒体上也流传着类似的警告，告诫医生不要在死亡证明上""随意填写新冠""。"
"Several modelers have even been skeptical of leaked information from government officials on case counts, which have been used to assess the scale of China's outbreak. One recent estimate, making the rounds in news reports and on Chinese social media, cited data from national health officials that 250 million people had been infected in the first 20 days of December.",一些建模者甚至对政府官员泄露的病例数信息表示怀疑，这些数据一直被用来评估中国疫情的规模。最近在新闻报道和中国社交媒体上流传的一项估计，引用了国家卫生官员的数据，称在12月的前20天里，有2.5亿人被感染。
Some scientists said that such massive figures indicated either that China had been suppressing data for months or that it was trying to make it seem like the outbreak had peaked.,一些科学家表示，如此庞大的数据表明，中国要么数月来一直在压制数据，要么是在试图让疫情看起来已经达到顶峰。
"""Either they know something we don't,"" said Dr. Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, ""or they're trying to say the worst is already over.""","""要么他们知道一些我们不知道的事情，""华盛顿大学健康指标与评估研究所所长克里斯托弗·默里说，""要么他们是在试图说，最糟糕的时候已经过去了。"""
"""I suspect it's now the latter,"" he said, referring to the idea that China was trying to make it look like the worst had passed. It seems unlikely that China would have been able to fake the numbers for months without raising suspicions, he said.","""我怀疑现在是后者，""他说，指的是中国试图让最糟糕的时期看起来已经过去。他说，中国似乎不太可能在几个月的时间里伪造数据而不引起怀疑。"
"The about-face on China's messaging is also complicating scientists' assessments. Just a month ago, China's state-controlled media was warning about the dangers of the virus. Now, it is saying the current Omicron variant is mild and the outbreak is manageable.",中国在信息传递方面的大转变也让科学家的评估变得复杂。就在一个月前，中国国家控制的媒体还在警告病毒的危险。现在，它表示目前的奥密克戎变异株是温和的，疫情是可控的。
"Scientists and public health experts, though, are worried that Omicron has looked less severe in other places in large part because those populations had huge stores of immunity, including from past infections a set of circumstances that does not hold in China. If China tries to soldier through its outbreak, without reimposing public health measures or ramping up vaccinations, scientists are concerned that many more may needlessly die.",然而，科学家和公共卫生专家担心，奥密克戎毒株在其他地方看起来没有那么严重，这在很大程度上是因为这些地方的人口拥有大量免疫力，包括从过去的感染中获得的免疫力——这种情况在中国并不存在。科学家们担心，如果中国试图在不重新采取公共卫生措施或加大疫苗接种力度的情况下撑过暴发期，可能会有更多人不必要地死亡。
"The Hong Kong researchers, for example, found that administering more fourth vaccine doses and antiviral medications and using social-distancing measures could save at least 250,000 lives during China's reopening. Dr. Murray's team, too, found that social-distancing mandates could help spare hospitals from a concentrated surge of patients, reducing the death toll by 200,000 by April and by even more when combined with greater masking and antiviral use.",例如，香港研究人员发现，在中国重新开放期间，注射更多第四剂疫苗，使用抗病毒药物，并采取社交距离措施，可以挽救至少25万人的生命。默里的团队也发现，保持社交距离的要求可以帮助医院避免患者集中激增，到4月，可以减少20万的死亡人数，如果结合更多口罩和抗病毒药物的使用，死亡人数会减少更多。
"How the Chinese public perceives the threat of the outbreak will also be important for its trajectory. Even if people decide to start taking more precautions for only a short period, scientists said, it could mean the difference between hospitals being able to treat their sickest patients or being completely overwhelmed.",中国公众如何看待疫情威胁也将对疫情发展轨迹产生重要影响。科学家说，即使只是决定在短时间内开始采取更多的预防措施，也将带来很大的区别，决定了医院是能够治疗病情最严重的病人，还是完全不堪重负。
"The vaccination rate in the country is another major variable. While 90 percent of the population has received two shots, the booster rate is much lower for older Chinese people. The World Health Organization has said three shots are crucial with Chinese vaccines that use inactivated virus.",中国的疫苗接种率是另一个主要变量。虽然90%的人都接种过两次疫苗，但老年人的接种率要低得多。世界卫生组织表示，中国使用灭活病毒的疫苗，三次注射至关重要。
"Extra protection from additional doses should arrive in less than two weeks for people with previous shots, said James Trauer, an expert on modeling infectious diseases at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. And he noted that the size of the country means that the outbreak will not reach everyone at the same time, giving some places extra time to get more people inoculated.",澳大利亚墨尔本莫纳什大学传染病建模专家詹姆斯·特劳尔说，对于以前注射过疫苗的人来说，加强针可以在不到两周的时间内产生额外保护。他指出，这个国家的规模意味着疫情不会同时蔓延到所有人，这给了一些地方更多时间，让更多人接种疫苗。
"Scientists are studying transportation patterns to understand how fast the outbreak might spread, but the picture isn't clear.",科学家们正在研究交通模式，以了解疫情传播的速度，但目前情况尚不清楚。
"The Hong Kong scientists, in their recent study, analyzed passenger data from a handful of Beijing subway lines. The information, they said, suggested that mobility in the city had dropped to low levels as people stayed home to protect themselves against the virus.",香港科学家在最近的研究中分析了北京几条地铁线路的乘客数据。他们说，这些信息表明，由于人们待在家里保护自己免受病毒感染，城市的流动性已降至较低水平。
"But Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said there were some indications that at least in big cities, foot traffic was picking up and restaurants were getting busier.",但美国外交关系委员会全球健康高级研究员黄严忠表示，有迹象表明，至少在大城市，人流量正在增加，餐馆也越来越繁忙。
"""That sort of seems to challenge the notion that people are actually exercising precaution,"" he said.","""这似乎在某种程度上与人们实际上在采取预防措施的观念相悖，""他说。"
"Without better indications of how often Covid infections are turning deadly in China, many scientists have leaned on comparisons with Hong Kong. The Chinese territory, which like China had also been slow to encourage vaccines, was particularly vulnerable when Omicron began spreading there in early 2022.",由于无从判断新冠病毒感染在中国变得有多么致命，许多科学家都依赖于与香港的比较。和中国一样，这块属于中国的领土在鼓励接种疫苗方面行动迟缓，因此奥密克戎于2022年初开始传播时，香港显得尤为脆弱。
"Some models have assumed that China would experience an infection fatality ratio very similar to Hong Kong's in the early stages of its outbreak. Back then, nearly 10,000 people in a territory of 7.5 million died within months of Omicron spreading. A comparable toll in China, with its 1.4 billion people, would be far higher.",一些模型假设，在疫情暴发的早期阶段，中国将经历与香港非常相似的感染病死率。当时，在奥密克戎病毒传播的几个月内，这个有750万人口的领土上有近一万人死亡。在有14亿人口的中国，死亡数字可能会高得多。
But there are also important differences. China has stronger vaccine coverage in its older population than Hong Kong did at the start of its surge.,但也有重要的区别。中国老年人口的疫苗覆盖率高于香港病例激增之初的水平。
"Based on the timing of their respective outbreaks, though, China's population-wide vaccination drive was earlier than in Hong Kong, meaning the effects of inoculations had longer to wane. Hong Kong also provided the option of Western vaccines with newer mRNA technology, while China relied exclusively on homegrown, less effective vaccines. Hospitals may also have a harder time handling the surge in some parts of China.",不过，根据各自暴发疫情的时间，中国的全民疫苗接种运动比香港早，这意味着疫苗接种效果减弱的时间更长。香港还提供了使用较新的mRNA技术的西方疫苗，而中国大陆则完全依赖效果较差的国产疫苗。中国部分地区的医院可能也更难应对激增的疫情。
The general lack of clarity has led to worries that the size of the outbreak could create more opportunities for the virus circulating through China imported versions of Omicron to mutate into a more dangerous variant.,总体上缺乏明确性导致人们担心，疫情的规模可能为在中国传播的病毒——输入版奥密克戎病毒——创造更多机会，变异成更危险的毒株。
But scientists are skeptical of such a scenario in China's current outbreak.,但科学家们对中国当前疫情会演变为这种情况持怀疑态度。
"Variants similar to those that China has reported were largely outcompeted months ago in the United States by more contagious or more elusive Omicron subvariants. After Italy mandated testing for travelers from China, it said the first cases it sequenced were all caused by an Omicron variant already present in Italy. European Union health officials said on Thursday that screening travelers from China was unjustified.",几个月前，在美国，与中国报告的变异株类似的病毒基本上被更具传染性、更难以捉摸的奥密克戎亚变异株所取代。在意大利要求对来自中国的旅行者进行检测后，它表示，它测序的第一批病例都是由意大利已经存在的奥密克戎变种引起的。欧盟卫生官员周四表示，对来自中国的游客进行筛查是不合理的。
"""We've had a huge number of infections internationally,"" said James Wood, an infectious disease expert at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, estimating that most people globally had caught the virus. ""That's a lot more infections than have occurred in China alone.""","""我们在国际上有大量的感染病例，""悉尼新南威尔士大学传染病专家詹姆斯·伍德说，他估计全球大多数人都感染了这种病毒。""这比中国一国的感染人数多得多。"""
"Some Chinese were disappointed by the Biden administration's new testing requirement for travelers coming from their country. Others radiated contempt, calling it the latest Western effort to contain China's rise. But many were simply indifferent.",拜登政府对来自中国的旅客提出了入境前需做新冠病毒检测的新要求，有些中国人对此感到失望。也有些人对此表示蔑视，称其为西方遏制中国崛起的最新做法。但许多人对新规定完全不在乎。
"For many Chinese, the U.S. rule that they must present negative Covid tests to visit is a tangential development. China is grappling with severe outbreaks that have sickened countless people and overwhelmed hospitals and funeral parlors. Many are focused on trying to hold on to their jobs and homes as the economy sputters.",对许多中国人来说，美国要求他们必须出示新冠病毒阴性证明才能入境的规定是一个不相干的问题。中国目前正在努力应对一波严重疫情，新冠病毒感染者不计其数，医院和殡仪馆不堪重负。经济不景气让许多人的注意力集中在保住工作和支付房贷上。
"And to many of those who have been considering travel, an extra Covid test is not a major inconvenience. Such testing had until recently been for many tens of millions of citizens a near-daily routine mandated by the authorities. And Chinese tourists know that they're welcome in a lot of places across Asia and beyond.",对许多一直在考虑出国旅行的人来说，多做一次核酸检测并不是多大的不便。直到最近，核酸检测曾是当局强迫数千万中国公民几乎每天都做的事情。而且中国旅客知道，他们在亚洲以及更远的许多地方都将受到欢迎。
"""It's just a Covid test before traveling,"" said Li Kuan, 33, a software engineer at a technology start-up in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. ""We've been doing a bunch of tests like this for the past three years.""","""只是出发前做个核酸，""现年33岁的李宽(音)说，他是中国南方城市广州一家科技初创公司的软件工程师。""我们过去三年像这样的检测做很多了。"""
"The rule from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced on Wednesday, will require negative tests from anyone, regardless of nationality or vaccination status, who wants to board a U.S.-bound flight in China. It will apply to travelers in Hong Kong and Macau, as well as to anyone coming from China who transits in the United States or enters it through a third country.",这条来自美国疾病控制与预防中心(CDC)的规定是周三宣布的，规定要求所有从中国乘飞机来美国的人必须提供新冠病毒阴性的证明，无论他们的国籍或疫苗接种情况如何。规定也适用于从香港和澳门来美国的旅客，以及所有来自中国在美国过境或通过第三国进入美国的人。
"The rule will take effect on Jan. 5, three days before China plans to drop the strict quarantine requirements that have been in place for inbound travelers for nearly three years.",美国的规定将于明年1月5日生效，也就是中国取消对入境旅客实行了近三年的集中隔离做法的三天前。
"People around the world are excited about the potential boon for business and tourism that would accompany a surge in Chinese tourists. But some also worry about how cases have exploded in the country since early December, when China abruptly lifted its ""zero Covid"" policy after mass protests over lockdowns that threatened the ruling Communist Party.","世界各地的人对伴随着中国游客而来的本地商业和旅游业可能得到的益处感到兴奋。但一些人也对中国自今年12月初以来的感染病例激增表示担心。中国许多地方发生了针对""新冠清零""政策的抗议，让执政的中共面临威胁后，政府突然在12月初取消了这项政策。"
"Officials in the United States fear that the coronavirus will spread rapidly in China, allowing new variants to develop and spread around the world.",美国官员担心新冠病毒将在中国迅速传播，从而导致新的变异株出现，传播到世界其他地方。
"On Wednesday, the C.D.C. said that it was requiring a negative Covid test for travelers from China to slow the spread of the virus in the United States. As new variants of the virus emerge around the world, China's ""reduced"" testing and case reporting and ""minimal"" sharing of epidemiological data could delay their identification, the agency said.","美国疾病控制与预防中心周三说，要求来自中国的旅客出示新冠病毒阴性证明是为了减缓病毒在美国的传播。CDC表示，随着新冠病毒的新变异株在世界各地出现，中国""减少""检测和通报病例，以及""最低限度""的共享流行病学数据的做法，可能会延误新变异株的鉴定。"
"Italy, South Korea and Japan have recently imposed similar travel restrictions, and India now requires negative Covid test results and random screening at airports for passengers arriving from China, including Hong Kong, as well as from Japan, South Korea and Thailand.",意大利、韩国和日本最近已对来自中国的旅客实施了类似的旅行限制，印度现在要求对来自中国(包括香港)以及日本、韩国和泰国的旅客出示新冠病毒阴性的证明，并在机场对他们进行随机筛查。
"On Thursday in China, the Communist Party's main propaganda outlets, usually quick to criticize countries that impose restrictions on Chinese travelers, appeared to downplay the U.S. news. The C.D.C. rule itself was barely mentioned on many of the party's main platforms.",中共主要宣传机构在周四似乎对来自美国的消息进行了淡化处理，它们通常会迅速批评任何对中国旅客采取限制做法的国家。许多中共官媒的网站对美国疾控中心的规定几乎只字不提。
"Some sites instead highlighted the positive reception China's easing has been getting in other countries. ""China's new measures 'enhance global economic hope,'"" read the headline of an article in the Global Times, the Communist Party newspaper.","一些网站反而强调了中国放松出入境限制在其他国家获得的积极反响。""中国新举措'提升全球经济希望'，""中共报纸《环球时报》发表的一篇文章的标题写道。"
"Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said that China's official media could be wary of reporting too much on the U.S. restriction out of fear that doing so would draw attention to China's domestic outbreaks and fuel public anger.",中国人民大学国际关系学教授时殷弘说，中国官媒可能会对过多地报道美国的限制小心翼翼，因为担心这样做会引起人们对国内疫情的关注，激起公众的愤怒。
"""If you talk about this too much, you're bound to make mistakes,"" he said.","""这件事谈论多的话，言多必失，""他说。"
"For Beijing, it could be difficult to make the argument that the United States should not impose a testing requirement, when China itself still plans to maintain one, even after it eases the rules. The government will require incoming travelers to show a negative polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., test within 48 hours before departure.",从北京的角度来看，很难有理由要求美国不这样做。虽然政府取消了对入境者进行集中隔离的规定，但仍要求入境旅客持有出发前48小时内做的核酸阴性证明。
"At a routine news briefing in Beijing on Thursday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, did not directly address the Biden administration's move. He repeated talking points Beijing has used in the past week as some countries started imposing limits on Chinese travelers, saying that those pandemic measures should be ""scientific and appropriate.""","外交部发言人汪文斌在中国政府周四举行的例行记者会上没有直接提及拜登政府的规定。他重复了政府在过去一周里使用的说法。随着一些国家开始对中国旅客采取限制措施，他说，""各国防疫措施应当科学适度。"""
"But this time, he made a pointed reference to the question of discrimination, saying that such measures should also ""treat citizens of all countries equally.""","但他也专门提到了歧视问题，称这些措施也应""对各国公民一视同仁""。"
"Some Chinese citizens shrugged off the U.S. testing requirement, calling it a minor inconvenience for a population that has grown accustomed to near-constant P.C.R. testing throughout the pandemic.",一些中国公民不把美国的核酸检测要求当回事。他们说，对在整个疫情期间已习惯了近乎常态的核酸检测的人来说，美国的要求只是一个小小的不便。
"China's Covid-era testing requirements for international travelers have been ""way more complicated"" than what the United States is now requiring of travelers from the country, said Wang Xiaofei, 29, who works for a technology company in the southern megacity of Shenzhen.","中国在疫情期间对国际旅客的检测要求与美国现在对来自中国的旅客的要求相比""复杂多了""，在南方大城市深圳的一家科技公司工作的29岁的王晓菲(音)说。"
"""It is what it is,"" she said of the testing policy, adding that she would still travel to the United States if she had the opportunity. ""Just cooperate.""","""是怎样就怎样，""她提到检测政策时说，并补充说，如果她有机会的话，她会去美国旅行。""配合就行。"""
Others were less accommodating.,也有的人则不这么听之任之。
"Iris Su, 22, a university student in New York City, said that her parents, who live in the eastern city of Qingdao, had been thinking of visiting her after the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday in late January. ""Now they aren't so sure,"" she said. ""They are a bit unhappy with the U.S. restrictions.""","现年22岁的爱丽斯·苏(音)正在纽约市读大学。她说，她父母住在青岛，他们一直想在明年1月下旬的春节长假过后来美国看她。""现在他们不那么肯定了，""她说。""他们对美国的限制有点不满。"""
"Ms. Su said she saw the C.D.C. rule as a political move, not a scientific one. ""Ultimately, this is all confrontation between great powers,"" she added.","苏女士说，她把CDC的规定看作是政治性，而不是科学的。""最终都是大国间的对抗，""她补充道。"
"Several epidemiologists said on Thursday that the new U.S. policy would be ineffective, based on evidence from other places including Hong Kong, a Chinese territory, where a raft of testing requirements for incoming travelers earlier this year failed to prevent a sharp rise in the number of imported cases.",几名流行病学家周四说，来自其他地方(包括中国香港)的证据表明，美国的新政策不会有多大效果。今年早些时候香港曾对入境旅客有各种各样的检测要求，但未能阻止输入病例的急剧上升。
"Karen Grepin, a global health policy expert at the University of Hong Kong, said that while the C.D.C.'s new rule may prevent superspreader conditions on airplanes, it would not stop new variants just as earlier bans on international travel did very little to stop the spread of the Omicron variant.",香港大学全球卫生政策专家葛瑞苹(Karen Grépin)说，虽然CDC的新规定可能会阻止飞机上发生超级传播的情况，但不能阻止新变异株的传播，就像此前的国际旅行禁令对阻止奥密克戎变异株的传播几乎没有作用一样。
"""What we should really be doing now as a global community is thinking about how to support the Chinese people through this transition, not shutting them off,"" she said.","""我们作为国际社会的成员，现在真正应该做的是，如何想办法支持中国人民度过这个转变，而不是将他们拒之门外，""她说。"
"It was unclear on Thursday how or whether the new C.D.C. rule would affect China's delicate relationship with the United States. When President Biden and Xi Jinping, China's powerful leader, met in Indonesia last month, they appeared eager for a soft reset of a relationship that had been careening toward confrontation. Yet the relationship remains stuck at its lowest point in years amid disagreements over the future of Taiwan, technology restrictions and China's mass detentions of its citizens, among other issues.",CDC的新规定是否会影响以及如何影响中美之间的微妙关系，周四尚不明确。拜登总统和中国强大的领导人习近平上个月在印度尼西亚会晤时，似乎急于软重启一直在走向对抗的关系。但由于在台湾的未来、技术限制和中国大规模拘禁少数民族公民等问题上存在分歧，中美关系仍处在多年来的最低点。
"Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, described the C.D.C. rule as ""epidemiologically unconvincing and diplomatically unjustified.""","纽约外交关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠对CDC规定的看法是，""流行病学上没有说服力，外交上也不合理。"""
"""The overall reopening should be encouraged,"" he said, referring to China's plan to gradually dismantle its Covid testing infrastructure and travel restrictions. ""Now you're giving Chinese people the impression that you're punishing them.""","""全面重新放开应该得到鼓励，""他说，他指的是中国逐步取消核酸检测要求和入境限制的做法。""现在这样做给中国人的印象是，正在惩罚他们。"""
Mr. Huang said that he sympathized with international criticism of China's perceived reluctance to share coronavirus data with other countries. But he also worries that the C.D.C. requirement may be fodder forChinese nationalists who argue that the United States is trying to contain China's rise.,黄严忠说，他对国际上对中国不愿与其他国家分享新冠病毒感染数据的批评表示理解。但他也担心，CDC的要求可能给认为美国正试图遏制中国崛起的中国民族主义者们提供口实。
That was the tone on Thursday on some pages of the Global Times.,这正是《环球时报》周四发表在其他版面上的文章的调子。
"""The Covid outbreak this time tells China that it must recognize a basic fact,"" Shen Yi, a professor of international politics at Fudan University in Shanghai, wrote in a column.","""这次新冠疫情，告诉中国必须认清一个基本事实，""上海复旦大学国际政治学教授沈逸在一篇专栏文章中写道。"
"""That is that China's words, deeds and various policies will face electron microscope-level scrutiny by American and Western public opinion and anti-China politicians,"" he wrote. ""If there is a slight flaw, it will be infinitely magnified; if a flaw can't be found, they'd create it artificially.""","""那就是中国的言行举止、各项政策，会面临美西方舆论和反华政客电子显微镜级别的审视，""他写道。""如果稍有瑕疵，就会被无限放大。"""
"For the past three years, China largely shut its borders and kept its people home, retreating from the global engagement that was the foundation for its rise.",中国在过去三年里基本上关闭了边境，不让人民出国旅行，不再参与为中国崛起打下基础的全球接触。
"As the country now prepares to gradually reopen its doors to help rescue a faltering economy, the world is both excited about the potential boon for business and tourism, but wary about exposure to a country facing an explosion of Covid cases.",现在，为帮助挽救摇摇欲坠的经济，中国准备逐步重新敞开国门，世界对由此给商业和旅游业带来的潜在好处感到兴奋，同时对跟一个感染病例激增的国家进行接触导致的风险持谨慎态度。
"Starting Jan. 8, China will drop its strict quarantine requirements for travelers arriving from abroad and lift rules that had limited the number of incoming flights and passengers. It will start processing Chinese passport applications and mainland permits to go to Hong Kong and make it easier for foreigners to get visas for business, study and family reunions.",中国将从明年1月8日起取消对入境旅客进行严格隔离的要求，并取消对入境航班班次和旅客数量的限制。中国将开始办理中国人的护照申请和从内地前往香港的许可证，并让外国人更容易获得来中国经商、学习、与家庭团聚的入境签证。
"Immediately, bookings for flights surged as Chinese headed for the exits and planned long-delayed family reunions. Business groups and economists hailed the easing as an important step toward restoring confidence in China's prospects. On a popular social media site, the French Embassy in China wrote: ""Chinese friends, France welcomes you with open arms!""","新规定宣布后，航班预订量马上出现激增，有些中国人急于出国，有些在国外的则想回国进行规划已久的家庭团聚。商业团体和经济学家称赞放松入境限制是朝着恢复人们对中国前景信心迈出的重要一步。法国驻华大使馆在一个流行的社交媒体网站上写道:""中国朋友，法国张开双臂欢迎你们!"""
"But the optimism has been tempered by concerns about China's handling of the explosive wave of infections since it abruptly abandoned its ""zero Covid"" strategy. Hospitals and funeral parlors have been overwhelmed, and some medicines are scarce. The central government has also failed to provide reliable data, or estimates, on Covid infections and deaths, raising concerns about the scale of the outbreak and Beijing's credibility.","但对于中国出现爆炸性感染浪潮的担忧已经开始打击到这种乐观情绪。突然放弃了""新冠清零""政策后，中国各地都暴发了疫情。医院和殡仪馆人满为患，一些药品出现短缺。中央政府也不提供有关新冠病毒感染和死亡病例的可靠数据或估计，引发了人们对疫情规模和中国政府公信力的担忧。"
Many would-be travelers to China expressed worries about getting Covid in a country where medical services are already overstretched. Others wondered how welcoming China would be to foreigners after fanning nationalism and even xenophobia during the pandemic.,许多想去中国旅行的人担心在一个医疗系统已不堪重负的国家感染新冠病毒。还有人想知道，中国对外国人的欢迎程度如何，因为政府在疫情期间曾煽动民族主义甚至仇外情绪。
"Despite the lucrative prospect of Chinese tourists, some countries and cities are nervous about the potential flood of arrivals. In Italy, the health minister said on Wednesday that all travelers from China would be required to take Covid-19 antigen tests upon arrival so the virus could be sequenced if it is detected.",尽管中国游客给外国旅游业带来丰厚利润的前景相当可观，但一些国家和城市仍对可能到来的游客潮感到紧张。意大利卫生部长周三表示，所有来自中国的旅客在抵达时都必须进行新冠抗原检测，以便在检测到病毒时对其进行测序。
"""The measure is essential to ensure surveillance and detection of possible variants of the virus in order to protect the Italian population,"" said the minister, Orazio Schillaci.","卫生部长奥拉齐奥·斯基拉奇表示:""该措施对于确保监测和发现病毒的可能变种以保护意大利民众至关重要。"""
"Japan said it would limit the number and destination of flights from China and require those who recently traveled to the country to be tested on arrival, and sent to a weeklong quarantine if positive.",日本表示将限制来自中国的航班数量以及只可使用指定机场，并要求最近去过中国的人在抵达后接受病毒检测，如果阳性，需要进行为期一周的隔离。
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the restrictions were necessary because of the lack of transparency about Covid's spread in China.,日本首相岸田文雄说，有必要采取这些限制措施，因为中国的新冠病毒传播情况缺乏透明度。
"""There are major inconsistencies in the information about infections coming from the central and local authorities and from the government and the civilian sector,"" he said. ""That has made it difficult to get a clear grasp on the situation and has heightened concern here in Japan.""","""中央和地方当局，以及政府和民间部门有关感染情况的信息存在重大的不一致，""他说。""这让人们很难清楚地了解情况，加剧了日本的担忧。"""
The U.S. government on Wednesdayannounced a similar measureon travelers from China because of the lack of transparent data on the current outbreak.,由于缺乏对目前感染激增的透明数据，美国政府周三宣布了一项针对中国旅客的类似措施。
"Still, the loosening has unleashed massive pent-up demand. On Tuesday, a day after the changes were announced, bookings for flights from mainland China to popular destinations including Singapore, Japan and South Korea, rose threefold on Trip.com Group, a Chinese travel-booking company. Reservations for flights to the mainland increased fivefold, according to data provided by the company.",尽管如此，放松入境限制还是释放了大量被压抑的需求。周二，也就是宣布放松的第二天，在中国旅游预订公司携程网上，从中国大陆飞往新加坡、日本和韩国等热门目的地的航班预订量增加了三倍。据携程提供的数据，飞往大陆的航班预订量增加了五倍。
"Some airlines began to resume and increase flights to the mainland. Singapore Airlines said it would reinstate its Singapore-to-Beijing route for the first time since 2020 starting Friday, with more to be added in the coming months.",一些航空公司已开始恢复和增加飞往中国大陆的航班。新加坡航空公司表示，将从本周五开始恢复新加坡直飞北京的航线，这是自2020年以来的第一次，并将在未来几个月增加更多的航线。
"In Pakistan, Uzair Zahir, the owner of a travel agency in Islamabad, said he was certain that many Pakistanis would fly to China in January as soon as the restrictions lifted, regardless of the Covid situation.",巴基斯坦伊斯兰堡一家旅行社的业主乌扎尔·查希尔说，他确信一旦限制解除，许多巴基斯坦人将在明年1月马上飞往中国，不管中国的新冠病毒疫情怎样。
"""They don't have any concerns,"" he said, ""because everyone has had Covid a couple of times."" He said he had been inundated with calls and messages since Beijing's announcement, mostly from students and people who do business in China.","""他们没有任何担忧，""他说，""因为所有人都已感染过几次新冠病毒。""他说，自从中国政府宣布了这个消息以来，他的电话已经被打爆了，短信蜂拥而至，其中大多数来自学生和在中国做生意的人。"
The move is a relief for foreign businesses with operations in China. Many had complained that China's restrictions made it hard for companies to send employees and executives to their Chinese factories and offices.,放松入境限制让在中国有业务的外国企业如释重负。许多人曾抱怨，入境限制使得很难向中国的工厂和办公室派驻员工和管理人员。
"Rachel Speth, the owner of a business that sells bamboo-based kitchen utensils with offices in Shanghai and the United States, said that on her most recent trip back to China in September, she and her partner had to spend five weeks in quarantine after her partner tested positive for Covid.",雷切尔·斯佩思是一家销售竹制厨房用具的企业主，她的公司在上海和美国都有办事处。她说，她最近一次回到中国是今年9月，她的伴侣入境后新冠病毒检测呈阳性，导致两人不得不隔离了五周时间。
"The new policy is a dream come true, said Ms. Speth, who is in Shanghai. ""Now we can come and go freely. It's a new day for work schedules and work flow.""","新政策让她的梦想成真，身在上海的斯佩思说。""现在我们可以自由出入了。对工作日程和流程来说，这是新的一天。"""
"The easing gives businesses clarity that helps them plan for the future, said Eric Zheng, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, who welcomed Beijing's move. ""It's been three years its been too long for businesses to stay out of China.""","上海美国商会会长郑艺说，放松入境限制让企业有更清晰的前景，有助于他们规划未来。他对北京的做法表示欢迎。 ""已经三年了，企业进不了中国的时间太长了。"""
"Mr. Zheng predicted that companies would reassess the environment at the end of January, when a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday ends, and then make decisions. But he added a point of caution about the outbreak: ""They're not going to rush into anything given this surge in cases.""","郑艺预计企业将在明年1月底，也就是为期一周的农历新年假期结束时，重新评估中国的运营环境，然后做出决定。但他对目前的疫情提出了警告:""考虑到感染病例激增的情况，企业不会仓促行事。"""
"For some in the business world, the opening up of travel was a reassuring signal from the ruling Communist Party about its priorities. In his decade in power, Xi Jinping, the country's powerful leader, has sought to tighten the party's grip over the economy, prioritizing security and political discipline over growth. But in an annual meeting of China's top leaders two weeks ago, Mr. Xi urged officials to ""vigorously restore market confidence"" through stable growth and employment.","对工商界的一些人来说，放开旅行限制是执政的中共对其优先事项发出的让人放心的信号。中国强大的领导人习近平在执政的十年里一直寻求加强中共对经济的控制，将国家安全和政治纪律置于经济增长之上。但在两周前召开的中央经济工作会议上，习近平要求官员们通过稳定增长和就业来""大力提振市场信心""。"
"The new policy is the latest sign that China is finally returning to a more pragmatic, pro-business mentality, said Bruce Pang, chief economist for greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle, a global commercial real estate firm.",新政策是中国终于回归更加务实的亲商心态的最新迹象，全球商业房地产公司仲量联行大中华区首席经济学家庞溟说道。
"""These travel relaxations, together with the lifting of mass testing and domestic efforts to promote consumption, will help China achieve an economic growth rate of over 5 percent in 2023,"" Mr. Pang said.","""放松入境限制，加上取消大规模核酸检测和国内促进消费的努力，将帮助中国在2023年实现5%以上的经济增长率，""庞溟说。"
"Many homesick Chinese are hoping to visit during the Lunar New Year holiday, which traditionally is the world's largest annual migration, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel for family reunions.",许多思乡的中国人希望在农历新年假日期间回国，中国传统节日春节前后往往会出现世界上规模最大的年度人员流动，数以亿计的中国人为了与家人团聚而旅行。
"Zhang Yuhan, a 26-year-old employee at a securities firm in Japan, said that after waking up to the news about the reopening, she immediately started searching for tickets while brushing her teeth and putting makeup on, to try to snag tickets before they sold out.",日本证券公司26岁的职员张钰涵(音)说，一觉醒来得知中国重新开放边境的消息后，她一边刷牙化妆，一边马上开始搜机票，试图在售馨前抢到票。
"She said she bought a one-way ticket to Jilin Province for the holiday to see her grandmother, who is recovering from surgery. This would be her first trip home in three years.",她说，她买到了一张飞往吉林省的单程机票，将在春节期间去看望手术后正在康复的祖母。这是她三年来第一次回国。
"""I'm just so very excited, I really want to return to China to see my friends at home and eat delicious food,"" Ms. Zhang said.","""我实在是太兴奋了，真想回国看望家人和朋友，吃点好吃的，""张女士说。"
"The lifting of quarantine rules does not end all obstacles to travel to China. The government has not said if it would start issuing tourist visas again. Also, many people can't afford the airfare.",取消入境集中隔离的规定并没有消除去中国旅行的所有障碍。政府尚未表示是否将重新开始签发旅游签证。此外，许多人仍买不起机票。
"Gwen Zhao, 28, a Chinese Ph.D. student in Japan said she was sorry that she couldn't be with her family when her grandmother died last year. She hopes to visit next year but will need to wait for airfares to fall. Round-trip tickets used to cost her about $400, she said, but are now about $2,800 seven times as much.",在日本读博的28岁的格温·赵(音)说，去年她的祖母去世后不能与家人在一起让她遗憾。她想明年回趟国，但需要等机票价格降下来。她说，以前花大约400美元就能买到往返机票，但现在要花大约2800美元，是以前的七倍。
Other travelers are optimistic that China's outbreak will subside in the coming months and are looking forward to rekindling old friendships.,还有旅行者对中国的疫情将在未来几个月内消退持乐观态度，他们期待着与老朋友叙旧。
"Before Covid, Chen Hsuan, a sales manager at a technology company in Taipei, traveled frequently inside China, backpacking through the hills of Xinjiang in the country's far west and lounging on the beaches of Hainan. Along the way, she made many friends, most of whom she has not seen since China's borders shut.",新冠病毒疫情暴发前，台北一家技术公司的销售经理陈轩(音)经常去大陆旅行，她背包穿越过中国西部偏远的新疆山区，曾在海南的海滩休闲。她在旅行期间结交了很多朋友，自从中国关闭边境以来，她与这些朋友中的大部分都没见过面。
"""The lifting came faster than I expected,"" she said. She added that she hoped to visit China in April. ""It's good to see that China, which has always been conservative, is willing to follow the trend of the international community.""","""放松的速度比我预期的要快，""她说。她还说，她想在明年4月份去大陆。""很高兴看到一向保守的中国政府愿意随国际社会的大流。"""
"Slumped in wheelchairs and lying on gurneys, the sickened patients crowd every nook and cranny of the emergency department at the hospital in northern China. They cram into the narrow spaces between elevator doors. They surround an idle walk-through metal detector. And they line the walls of a corridor ringing with the sounds of coughing.",有人瘫坐在轮椅里，有人躺在轮床上，中国北方这家医院的急诊科每个角落里都是生病的人。他们挤在电梯门之间的狭窄空间里。他们围在一个不工作的金属探测门旁。他们沿着走廊的墙排成一行，走廊里的咳嗽声此起彼伏。
"China's hospitals were already overcrowded, underfunded and inadequately staffed in the best of times. But now with Covid spreading freely for the first time in China, the medical system is being pushed to its limits.",即使在最好的情况下，中国的医院也处于人满为患、资金不足、人手不够的状况。现在，随着新冠病毒首次在全国范围内不受控制地传播，医疗系统正被推向极限。
"The scenes of desperation and misery at the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, captured on one of several videos examined by The New York Times, reflects the growing crisis. Even as Covid cases rise, health workers on the front lines are also battling rampant infections within their own ranks. So many have tested positive for the virus in some hospitals that the remaining few say they are forced to do the job of five or more co-workers.",《纽约时报》查看的几段视频中，有一段捕捉到了天津医科大学总医院的绝望和痛苦场景，反映出日益严重的医疗危机。甚至在新冠病毒感染病例激增之际，一线医务工作人员还不得不与自己队伍中失控的感染作斗争。有些医院感染新冠的工作人员如此之多，以至于尚未感染的少数人员说，他们被迫做五名或更多同事的工作。
,
"To ensure enough staff members are on the floor, some facilities have given up requiring doctors and nurses to test themselves before work. One doctor in the central city of Wuhan said her hospital's staff had been so depleted that a neurosurgeon in her department recently had to perform two operations in one day while fighting symptoms of Covid.",为了确保有足够的医务人员来上班，一些机构已放弃了医护人员在上班前自我检测的要求。中部城市武汉的一名医生说，她所在医院的人手已严重不足，以至于她所在科室的一名神经外科医生不得不在自己感染了新冠病毒的情况下，一天里给两名患者做手术。
"""The hospital was operating on the brink,"" said the physician, Dr. Judy Pu, whose ward usually has 10 to 15 nurses and was down to just a pair. ""About 80 to 90 percent of the people around me have been infected.""","""医院在一个边缘状态运作，""这名叫朱迪·浦(音)的 大夫说，她所在的病房通常有10到15名护士，现在只剩下两名仍在工作。""我周围90%、80%的人都感染了。"""
"China was the first country to experience the panic of Covid when it emerged from Wuhan in 2019. Then, for the past three years, the country largely suppressed the virus with a costly mix of mass testing, strict lockdowns and border closures. The government could have used the time to bolster its health system by stockpiling medicine and building more critical care units. It could have launched a major vaccination drive targeting the millions of vulnerable older adults who were reluctant to receive a jab or booster. China did little of that, however, plunging into crisis mode again like in the early days of Wuhan.",新冠病毒2019年在武汉出现时，中国是第一个经历了新冠病毒恐慌的国家。后来，中国用代价高昂的全员核酸检测、严格封控，以及关闭边境等措施，在过去三年的时间里在很大程度上遏制了病毒的传播。政府本可以利用这段时间加强国内的卫生系统，储备药物，建更多的重症监护室;本可以发动一场针对数百万不愿接种疫苗或疫苗加强剂的弱势老年人的大规模疫苗接种运动。但中国基本上没有这样做，而是再次陷入了危机模式，就像武汉疫情暴发初期那样。
"The actual scale of China's health emergency has been difficult to gauge in no small part because the government did away with mass testing after abruptly lifting the country's stringent ""zero Covid"" measures. The country's inadequate vaccination levels as well as the lack of herd immunity have raised fears that death tolls could reach those seen earlier in the pandemic in places like the United States, Western Europe, and, more recently, Hong Kong.","很难衡量中国目前卫生紧急状况的真实规模，这在很大程度上是因为政府在突然取消了严格的""新冠清零""措施后，不再进行大规模病毒检测。中国的疫苗接种覆盖不足，也缺乏群体免疫力，已引发了人们的担忧，人们担心中国这轮疫情的死亡率可能会达到美国和西欧在新冠病毒大流行初期以及香港等地最近出现过的水平。"
"Data released by local authorities in recent days seem to confirm that the virus is running rampant, with reports from several cities and provinces of hundreds of thousands of infections recorded daily. Questions also abound about the number of Covid-related deaths China is reporting because officials only count those who die from respiratory failure directly linked to a Covid infection. Officially, seven people have died from the virus since pandemic rules were relaxed on Dec. 7, a number that belies mounting anecdotal evidence from across the country from the crush of hearses outside a crematory in Beijing to the overflow of yellow body bags at some funeral homes.",地方当局最近几天发布的数据似乎证实了新冠病毒正在泛滥，多个省份和城市通报的日新增感染人数达数十万例。人们对中国通报的与新冠病毒有关的死亡人数也有很多疑问，因为官方只把死于与新冠病毒感染直接相关的呼吸衰竭的人统计进来。自12月7日政府放弃了清零政策以来，官方公布仅七例死于新冠病毒，这个数字掩盖了来自全国各地越来越多的传闻证据——从北京的火葬场外排长队的灵车，到一些地方的殡仪馆里摆满了黄色尸袋。
"A Shanghai hospital predicted half of Shanghai's 25 million residents would eventually be infected and warned its staff of a ""tragic battle"" in the coming weeks, according to a now-deleted statement the hospital posted last week on the social media platform WeChat.","上海一家医院上周在社交媒体平台微信上发的动员令中预测，全市2500万居民中最终将有一半人感染病毒，并警告医院员工将在未来几周面临一场""惨烈的战役""，该动员令现已被删除。"
"""In this tragic battle, all of Shanghai will fall, and all the staff of the hospital will be infected! Our whole families will be infected! Our patients will all be infected!"" the statement read. ""We have no choice, and we cannot escape.""","""在这场惨烈的战役中，大上海将整个沦陷，我们将全院职工感染!我们将全家感染!我们的患者将全部感染!""动员令写道。""我们没有选择，躲是躲不过的。"""
Manpower is stretched so thin in some hospitals that retired doctors are being asked to return to work. Physicians and nurses are reportedly being pulled from the eastern provinces of Shandong and Jiangsu to fortify medical facilities in Beijing.,一些医院的人手严重不足，以至于已退休的医务人员被要求重返岗位。有报道称，山东省和江苏省已派出由医生和护士组成的医疗团队去支援北京的医院。
"Medical students who work as resident doctors and interns at hospitals have protested the deteriorating working conditions. They demanded that students be allowed to return home for winter break if they wanted to, and asked for equal pay and better protection from the virus for those who chose to work. Such students are among the lowest-paid medical workers, despite being expected to work longer hours.",在医院担任住院医生和实习生的医学院学生们对不断恶化的工作条件提出了抗议。他们要求如果学生想回家过寒假的话，应该允许他们回家，并要求为那些选择留下来工作的人支付与正式员工相同的工资、提供更好的防病毒防护。实习学生是收入最低的医务人员之一，尽管他们要工作更长的时间。
,
"Their demonstrations coincided with the death on Dec. 14 of a 23-year-old medical student who had been working at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University in the southwestern city of Chengdu. The hospital said the student suffered a heart attack, but his classmates have disputed the claim, saying he collapsed because he was overworked while infected with Covid.",这些抗议活动发生的时间与成都的四川大学华西医院工作的一名23岁的医学院学生12月14日死亡的时间相近。华西医院说这名学生死于心脏病突发，但他的同学对此说法提出异议，称他倒下是因为他感染了新冠病毒后仍在工作、过度劳累的结果。
"The staffing crisis is expected to worsen as the winter wears on and millions of migrant workers travel home ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in January. Health workers are already experiencing chaos behind the scenes marked by shifting policies, physical and mental exhaustion and widespread frustration over the government's failure to give them time to prepare for the surge of patients.",随着冬天的到来，以及数百万农民工将在明年1月的农历新年假期到来前返乡，估计医院的人手短缺危机将进一步恶化。医务工作者已经在经历着人们看不到的混乱——政策反复无常、身心疲惫，以及对于政府没有给他们时间为激增的感染者做准备普遍存在沮丧感。
"""We got no notice at all beforehand. I found out about the easing of restrictions from the news,"" Dr. Pu said.","""完全没有任何风声，看新闻才知道放开，""浦大夫说。"
"Medical staff say they could have avoided the medicine shortages that have forced some facilities to ration drugs. There also could have been more time to set up a more effective triage system to avoid overcrowding. One of the fundamental problems with China's health system is its overreliance on hospitals for even the most basic care. Large, urban facilities like the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, by number, account for only 0.3 percent of all health care providers in China, but they handled nearly a quarter of all outpatient visits in the country last year, data from the National Health Commission show.",医务人员说，他们本可以避免药品短缺问题，这个问题已迫使一些医院限量配药。本可以有更多时间来建立一个更有效的分诊系统，以避免过度拥挤。中国卫生系统的根本问题之一是，就连看最基本的病也过度依赖医院。据国家卫生健康委员会的数据，天津医科大学总医院这样的大型城市医疗机构的数量仅占中国所有医疗保健机构的0.3%，但它们去年的门诊就诊量占了全国的近四分之一。
"""In the U.S. people have their own primary physicians, but there are few ways in China to get care from the medical system except to go to an E.R. at a big hospital,"" said Dr. Qiao Renli, a pulmonary and critical care doctor at the University of Southern California, who has taught and practiced medicine in both China and the United States.","""美国人都有私人医生，中国除了到大医院急诊室没有别的办法进入医疗系统，""南加州大学呼吸科和重症监护医生乔人立博士说道，他有在中美两国带教和行医的经验。"
"To ease the burden on hospital workers, the government has been working to increase the number of ""fever clinics"" across the country. Such facilities are separate wings within hospitals or stand-alone clinics that are designated for treating patients with fevers, regardless of whether they have Covid. In the southern city of Shenzhen, officials set up fever clinics in booths that had previously been used to conduct Covid tests. In Beijing, the government said it converted empty stadiums and quarantine centers into similar facilities, raising the number of fever clinics to more than 1,000 in recent weeks.","为了减轻医护人员的负担，政府一直在努力增加全国""发热门诊""的数量。这些设施是医院或独立诊所单独开设的区域，专门用于接治发烧患者，不管他们是否患有新冠病毒疾病。南方城市深圳的官员们把以前用于核酸采样的亭子改为发热门诊。北京市的政府说，已将空置的体育场馆和集中隔离设施改为发热门诊，在最近几周里将发热门诊的数量增加到了1000多个。"
"The push to build more fever clinics highlights how quickly the government has tried to adapt to the fast-moving virus though sometimes too quickly, some health workers say.",设立更多发热门诊的努力凸显了政府极力尽快适应这种快速传播的病毒——尽管有时过快，一些医护人员说。
"Adela Xu, a nurse at a cancer center in Shanghai, said before restrictions were eased, staff and visitors needed to present negative Covid tests to enter her hospital. Then starting about a week ago, the hospital, under government orders, began constructing a fever clinic to help screen out patients who might have Covid. But by the time it opened, the facility was already rendered obsolete because the city stopped requiring Covid testing to enter the emergency room. At the same time, more and more people were becoming infected.",上海一家癌症中心的护士阿德拉·徐说，放宽防疫措施之前，工作人员和来访者需要出示核酸阴性证明，才能进入医院。后来，从大约一周前开始，医院按照政府的要求开始设发热门诊，帮助筛查可能的新冠病毒感染者。但等发热门诊开始接收患者时，它已经过时了，因为上海已不再要求人们进急诊室前做病毒检测。与此同时，感染新冠病毒的人正变得越来越多。
"""Last week, about 20 out of 700 of the E.R. patients tested were positive,"" Ms. Xu said. ""Now about 100 out of 700 are positive.""","""上礼拜门诊病人700人里20个人阳，""徐女士说。""现在700人里100个人阳。"""
The deluge of Covid patients is not the only challenge hospitals are facing. One of the ripple effects of the outbreak has been a widespread shortage of blood for transfusions because of the shrinking pool of eligible donors.,新冠病毒感染者激增并不是医院面临的唯一挑战。这轮疫情的涟漪效应之一是各地的血库告急，因为合格的献血者人数量越来越少。
"In the southwestern city of Kunming, a blood bank said in a statement that the city was getting a fraction of the 500 donors per day it needs to keep up with demand, and that the shortage had started to affect pregnant women and patients in intensive care units.",昆明市一家血库在一份声明中说，满足全市每天的用血需求通常需要500名献血者，现在来献血的人只是这个数字的一小部分，血液短缺已开始让孕妇和住在重症监护病房的患者受到影响。
"In response to the shortages, the National Health Commission revised its 2021 rules on blood donations this month, allowing people who have recovered from Covid to donate blood after seven days instead of six months. The new guideline also lifted restrictions that had been placed on potential donors who are close contacts of Covid patients.",为了应对血库缺血问题，国家卫健委本月修订了2021年启用的献血规定，允许感染新冠病毒后康复的人在康复七天后献血，而不是六个月后。新指南还取消了对与新冠病毒感染者有过密切接触的潜在献血者的限制。
,
"Some hospitals in Hebei Province near Beijing are reportedly experiencing a dire shortage of ventilators, oxygen tanks and intensive care beds. In a video shot by The Associated Press, a medical worker at a hospital in Zhuozhou, a city in northern Hebei, could be heard urging a group of people to transfer a patient to a different hospital that was better equipped, saying that the facility was out of oxygen supplies.",有报道称，北京附近河北省的一些医院已发生了呼吸机、氧气罐和重症监护病床严重短缺的问题。在美联社拍的一段视频中可以听到，河北北部城市涿州一家医院的一名医务人员敦促一群人将一名患者转移到另一家设备更好的医院去，说医院里的氧气供应已经不足。
"""If you can't even give him oxygen, how can you rescue him?"" the worker said. ""If you don't want any delays, turn around and transfer him quickly!""","""在外边抢救?这楼道里连个氧气、连个电都没有，连个吸氧都没有，""该医护人员说。""不想耽误就得赶紧转走!"""
"In its single-minded pursuit of the ""zero Covid"" strategy, the Chinese government was omnipresent and omnipotent, using its unlimited resources and unchecked power to control the nation. After having nearly exhausted its resources and the good will of the public, the government has now simply disappeared, just as many Chinese are getting very ill with the virus or dying from it.","在一心实施""清零""战略的过程中，中国政府仿佛无所不在、无所不能，用无限的资源和不受限制的权力来控制国家。在几乎耗尽资源和公众的善意之后，在许多中国人感染这种病毒而出现重症或因此而死亡时，政府却消失了。"
"For much of this year, Yang, an engineer in Shenzhen, took Covid tests nearly every day, from one of the more than 40 government-built booths in his neighborhood. Whenever he missed one, he would get text reminders from his district. After buying pain relief medication, he got calls from three different community workers because the state had strict rules about the sale of such over-the-counter drugs.",在今年的大部分时间里，在深圳当工程师的杨先生几乎每天都要在他家附近政府设立的40多个检测站中的一个进行核酸检测。每错过一次，他都会收到他所在区的短信提醒。在买了止痛药后，他接到了三个不同社区工作人员的电话，因为国家对这种非处方药的销售有严格的规定。
"Since the Chinese leadership abruptly abandoned its stringent ""zero Covid"" policy several weeks ago, Mr. Yang has rarely heard from the government.","自中国领导层几周前突然放弃严格的""清零""政策以来，杨先生很少听到来自政府的消息。"
"""No one is in charge now,"" said Mr. Yang, who asked to be identified only by his surname because of safety concerns. His daughter's school was still open last week even though most students were staying home, either because they were ill or worried about getting sick. There's no national mask mandate. People with mild symptoms are showing up at work because no one bothers to check in on them anymore. Medicines are in short supply, so Mr. Yang is sharing what he has with friends. His family has four rapid test kits, which are being saved until they're really needed.","""现在没人管了，""杨先生说。出于安全考虑，他要求只透露自己的姓。他女儿的学校上周仍在上课，尽管大多数学生都呆在家里，要么是因为生病了，要么是因为担心生病。国家不再强制戴口罩。有轻微症状的人会出现在工作场所，因为再也没有人关心他们的身体情况了。药品短缺，所以杨先生把药品分给朋友们。他的家里有四份快速检测试剂盒，是留到关键时刻的。"
"For a powerful government that likes to brag about its command of the country and has published a four-volume compilation of speeches and articles by its top leader titled ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China,"" the absence of direction at a moment of crisis has made the public question the legitimacy and the credibility of the Chinese Communist Party.",对于一个喜欢吹嘘对国家的掌控，并出版了最高领导人四卷本讲话和文章汇编《习近平谈治国理政》的强大政府来说，在危机时刻没有方向，使公众对中国共产党的合法性和可信度产生了怀疑。
It also highlights a crucial but not always obvious distinction in leadership.,它还突显了领导力中一个至关重要但并不总是很明显的区别。
"""The ability to control is different from the ability to govern,"" Chen Tianyong, an entrepreneur, wrote on his social media WeChat timeline last week.","""管控能力不等于社会治理能力，""企业家陈天庸上周在微信朋友圈写道。"
"Xu Kaizhen, a best-selling author famous for novels that explore the intricate workings of China's bureaucratic politics, wrote on his verified Weibo account that the abrupt change made it abundantly clear ""what our government will do, what it likes to do, what it can do, what it doesn't like to do, what it can't do and what it doesn't want to do.""","以探索中国官僚政治复杂运作的小说而闻名的畅销书作家许开祯在他的认证微博账户上写道，这种突然的变化非常清楚地表明，""我们的政府究竟会干什么爱干什么能干什么不爱干什么不会干什么不愿干什么。"""
"If good governance is about transparency, responsibility, accountability and responsiveness to the needs of the people, the Chinese government has barely practiced it, either in its harsh ""zero Covid"" policy, or in its haphazard reopening.","如果说善治意味着透明、负责、问责和对人民需求的回应，那么中国政府几乎没有践行这一点，无论是在严厉的""清零""政策中，还是在杂乱无章的重新开放中。"
"It could have spent its resources on increasing vaccine coverage among older people and adding I.C.U. beds. Instead, it spent money on mass Covid testing and building enormous quarantine camps.",它本可以把资源花在提高老年人的疫苗覆盖率和增加重症监护室床位上。然而，它把钱花在了大规模的新冠检测和建造巨大的方舱上。
"It could have communicated scientific facts about symptoms and death rates of the Omicron variant. Instead, it fanned fears about Covid.",它本可以传达关于奥密克戎变种的症状和死亡率的科学事实。然而，它煽动人们对新冠的恐惧。
"It could have stocked up on fever medicines and provided the public with the best vaccines available. Instead, it made it extremely difficult for people to buy antipyretics and didn't approve the public use of foreign mRNA vaccines, which have proven more effective than the Chinese ones in preventing severe symptoms.",它本可以储备退烧药，并向公众提供最好的疫苗。然而，它让人们很难买到退烧药，并且没有批准公众使用国外的mRNA疫苗，这些疫苗已经被证明在预防重症方面比中国的疫苗更有效。
"Unlike many governments that took steps to flatten the infection curve before reopening, the Chinese government suddenly let go of nearly all restrictions, most likely an effort to rush an enormous country to herd immunity while leaving the old and vulnerable in precarious situations.",与许多政府在重新开放前采取措施压平感染曲线不同，中国政府突然取消了几乎所有的限制，很可能是为了让一个庞大的国家迅速实现群体免疫，而这会把老年人和弱势群体置于危险境地。
"Its main advice to the public: ""You're in charge of your own health."" The slogan has since earlier this year been promoted and repeated by state media and local governments since the reopening.","它对公众的主要建议是:""每个人都是自己健康的第一责任人。""自今年早些时候重新开放以来，官方媒体和地方政府一直在宣传和重复这一口号。"
"But the pandemic is a public health crisis, and such crises are part of the reason governments exist.",但这场大流行是一场公共卫生危机，而这种危机正是政府存在的原因之一。
"The change in pandemic control strategy doesn't mean the government ""can sit on its hands,"" Wu Jinglian, a top Chinese economist known for advocating for smaller government, told the Caixin magazine. It ""must avoid going from one extreme to the other.""","以倡导小政府而闻名的中国顶级经济学家吴敬琏在接受《财新》杂志采访时表示，疫情控制策略的变化并不意味着政府""无所作为""。它""必须避免从一个极端走向另一个极端""。"
"Qin Liwen, a former journalist, wrote on her WeChat timeline: ""Only when a government does what it's supposed to do, can the people be responsible for themselves.""","前记者覃里雯在她的微信上写道:""只有政府把该做的做好了，人民才能自己负责自己。"""
"The local governments haven't been doing much either. Many officials are probably waiting for guidance from their superiors. ""Zero Covid"" could be quantified so everyone knew what to do. In a top-down system like the Communist Party, the underlings are often at a loss for what to do when the big boss doesn't set a goal.","地方政府也没有采取什么措施。许多官员可能在等待上级的指示。""清零""可以量化，这样每个人都知道该怎么做。在共产党这样一个自上而下的体制下，当上级没有设定目标时，下属往往会不知所措。"
"For weeks, Mr. Xi said nothing about the end of the country's ""zero Covid"" policy, which was considered his signature campaign. On Monday, in his first public comment on the dismantling of ""zero Covid,"" Mr. Xi was vague, saying that China's epidemic prevention and control was facing new situations and tasks. He urged the public to ""develop good personal hygiene habits"" and ""practice a civilized and healthy lifestyle."" His remarks didn't mention either the high infection rates or the death counts.","几周来，习近平对结束中国的""清零""政策只字未提，该政策被认为是他的标志性运动。周一，在他对取消""清零""的首次公开讲话中，习近平含糊其辞，说中国的疫情防控正面临新的形势和任务。他敦促公众""养成良好的个人卫生习惯""，""践行文明健康的生活方式""。他的讲话既没有提到高感染率，也没有提到死亡人数。"
It would be wise for the officials to wait for his directive. But the public can't wait.,官员们等待他的指示是明智之举。但公众不能等待。
"Emotions are running high as millions of people are becoming infected every day, leaving pharmacy shelves empty, medical workers overwhelmed and morgues full.",群情激愤，因为每天都有数百万人被感染，药店货架空空如也，医务人员不堪重负，停尸房堆满尸体。
"""The virus wasn't eliminated to zero,"" a recent Weibo comment said. ""The government's credibility has been reduced to zero.""","""病毒并没有被清零，""最近一条微博评论说。""是政府的可信度被清零。"""
"A widely circulated WeChat article speculated that the shortage of fever medications reflected the government's lack of preparation for loosening control. And if the government had shown the same political will that it had in implementing ""zero Covid,"" the article argued, it could have ensured there was ample supply of such medication.","微信上一篇广为流传的文章推测，发烧药物的短缺反映了政府对放松管制缺乏准备。文章认为，如果政府表现出跟实施""清零""同样的政治意愿，本可以确保这种药物的充足供应。"
"""It doesn't care about the ordinary people, leaving them to fend for themselves and even delighting in their chaos,"" the article said, and it urged officials to show up where the public most needed them to win back trust.","文章说，""对老百姓不管不顾，任由自生自灭，甚至抱着看笑话的心理放任自流。""文章敦促官员出现在公众最需要他们的地方，以赢回信任。"
"The low confidence in the government is forcing people to help themselves and help one another. In local WeChat groups, people made arrangements to share their fever medicines and rapid test kits with their neighbors.",对政府没有信心迫使人们自助和互相帮助。在本地微信群中，人们与邻居分享退烧药和快速检测试剂盒。
"Tencent, the social media giant, also built a WeChat program where people could ask for medications from strangers with extra. The help requests are modest: six tablets of acetaminophen; four tablets of ibuprofen; two rapid test kits; one thermometer.",社交媒体巨头腾讯也建立了一个微信项目，帮助人们向有富余药物的陌生人寻求帮助。要求并不高:六片对乙酰氨基酚;四片布洛芬;两套快速检测试剂盒;一个温度计。
They are asking strangers for help because they're not getting it from their government.,他们向陌生人寻求帮助，因为他们无法从政府那里得到帮助。
"""Don't expect anything from Leviathan there's no point in appealing, either,"" Chen Min, a former journalist better known by his pen name, Xiao Shu, wrote on his WeChat timeline, referring to the central government. ""In the end, we have to help ourselves.""","笔名""笑蜀""的前记者陈敏在微信上写道:""对利维坦就不要有任何指望了。呼吁也没有意义。""利维坦指的是中央政府。""归根结底还是靠自救。"""
"Only by building an extensive network of social connections, he continued, ""can we weave a real social safety net in the darkest moment, build a real Noah's ark and save countless lives.""","他还说，只有建立一个广泛的社会横向联系，""才能在至暗时刻编织出真正的社会安全网，打造出真正的诺亚方舟，拯救无数生灵。"""
This is exactly the type of governance crisis about which Mr. Xi had once warned the party.,这正是习近平曾经警告过的一种共产党的治理危机。
"""It is not up to us to judge our party's governance capacity or performance; they must and can only be judged by the people,"" Mr. Xi said in a speech in 2013. ""If we are pretentious and divorce ourselves from the people or put ourselves above them, we will surely be abandoned by them. This is the case for any party, and is an iron law which admits of no exception.""","""我们党的执政水平和执政成效都不是由自己说了算，必须而且只能由人民来评判，""习近平在2013年的一次讲话中说。""人民是我们党的工作的最高裁决者和最终评判者。如果自诩高明、脱离了人民，或者凌驾于人民之上，就必将被人民所抛弃。任何政党都是如此，这是历史发展的铁律，古今中外概莫能外。"""
"China on Monday announced that travelers from overseas would no longer be required to enter quarantine upon arrival, in one of the country's most significant steps toward reopening since the coronavirus pandemic began.",中国周一宣布，入境人员将不再需要接受隔离，这是自新冠疫情开始以来中国迈向重新开放的最重要措施之一。
"From Jan. 8, incoming travelers will be required to show only a negative polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., test within 48 hours before departure, China's National Health Commission said. Limitations on the number of incoming flights will also be eased.",中国国家卫健委表示，自1月8日起，入境旅客只需提供出发前48小时的一次核酸阴性结果。对入境航班数量的限制也将放宽。
"The travel restrictions had isolated the world's most populous country for nearly three years. Foreigners were essentially barred from entering China in 2020, and even when they were allowed back in months later, it was generally only for business or family reunions.",旅行限制使这个世界上人口最多的国家在近三年时间都处于与世隔离的状态。2020年，外籍人士基本被禁止入境，即便在几个月后被允许返回，通常也只是为了商务或家庭团聚。
"Even some Chinese nationals were unable to return home initially, and travelers allowed to enter were required to undergo extensive health screening and quarantine at their own expense sometimes for as long as two months.",最初甚至连一些中国公民也无法回国，获准入境的旅客必须自费接受冗长的健康筛查和隔离——有时长达两个月之久。
"The announcement on Monday was the latest reversal in China's ""zero Covid"" approach to the virus, which for years saw Beijing seek to eliminate infections. But the policy, which involved harsh and prolonged lockdowns of hundreds of millions of people, crushed the economy and stirred public discontent.","周一的公告是中国""新冠清零""防疫政策的最新转向，数年来北京都在努力清除感染。但该政策涉及影响数亿民众严厉、漫长的封锁，压垮了经济，并激起了公众不满。"
"In November, after a fire led to the deaths of 10 people in the Xinjiang region, with many people suspecting that a Covid lockdown had hampered rescue efforts, protests erupted across the country. It was one of the boldest and most widespread outbreaks of dissent in decades. Within days, the government began loosening restrictions.",11月，在新疆地区的一场火灾导致10人丧生后，许多人怀疑新冠封锁措施阻碍了救援工作，全国各地爆发了抗议活动。这是数十年来最大胆、最广泛的异议爆发事件之一。很快，政府便开始放松管制。
"The easing of travel restrictions ""basically signals the final end of zero Covid,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. Though China had relaxed many of its zero-Covid domestic policies this month scrapping regular mandatory tests for urban residents and allowing home quarantine for the infected, for example it had held on to its international limitations.","总部位于纽约的外交关系协会的全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠表示，旅行限制的放松""基本标志着'新冠清零'的正式结束""。尽管中国本月放宽了许多""新冠清零""的国内政策——例如取消对城镇居民的定期强制核酸，并允许居家隔离——但该国仍然坚持国际管控政策。"
"The new measures do not amount to China's throwing open its borders, however. Many details remained unclear. The government has not said when it will resume issuing tourist visas all such visas that were valid at the start of the pandemic have been suspended. Officials said that they would ""further optimize"" the ability of foreigners to apply for visas for business, study or family reunions, without offering specifics.","然而，这些新措施并不等于中国重新开放了边境。许多细节仍不明确。政府并未说明何时恢复签发旅游签证——疫情之初尚有效的所有此类签证都已暂停。官员称将会""进一步优化""外籍人士商务、留学、探亲团聚的签证安排，但没有提供具体细节。"
"Chinese officials also did not say how many flights would be allowed to enter the country. In November, the number of international flights to China was 6 percent of what it was in 2019, according to the flight tracker VariFlight.",中国官员也没有说明将允许多少航班进入中国。根据航班追踪机构飞常准的数据，11月飞往中国的国际航班数量是2019年的6%。
"China will also allow its citizens to resume traveling abroad for leisure in an ""orderly"" fashion, officials said. During the pandemic, the government stopped issuing or renewing Chinese nationals' passports except in limited circumstances, and in May it said it would ""strictly restrict nonessential exit activities.""","官员表示，中国还将允许公民""有序""恢复出境游。疫情期间，除少数情况，政府停止签发或更新中国公民的护照，并在5月宣称将""从严限制中国公民的非必要出境活动""。"
"The end to the international Covid quarantine was part of a broader announcement on Monday that China would downgrade its classification of the coronavirus. Previously, the government treated Covid-19 as a Category A infectious disease, on par with cholera or the bubonic plague. Under that categorization, officials had to put in place extensive restrictions to control the spread, including lockdowns and quarantines. Going forward, Covid will be treated as a Category B disease, which includes AIDS and bird flu.",除了宣布入境新冠隔离的结束，周一的公告还宣称，中国将对新冠病毒的分类进行降级。此前政府将新冠当作甲类传染病管理，与霍乱或鼠疫同级。按照这一分类规定，官员必须实施大规模限制措施来控制传播，包括封锁和隔离。接下来新冠将按照乙类传染病管理，此类疾病还包括艾滋病和禽流感。
"That change will further formalize China's shift away from zero Covid domestically, Dr. Huang said. While the earlier easing of restrictions had left local officials some leeway to decide how fast to reopen, Beijing was now signaling to officials nationwide that they should prioritize reviving the economy over disease control, he said.","黄严忠博士表示，这样的改变将进一步正式确定中国国内""新冠清零""政策的转变。他说，虽然此前的防疫放松给地方官员留有一些余地来决定重新开放的速度，但现在北京向全国官员发出的信号是，他们应该优先考虑重振经济，而不是疾病控制。"
"It was unclear, however, just how soon international travelers would be willing to visit China, and how much the economy would benefit from it. The recent loosening of restrictions has led to an explosion in infections. Many older Chinese are not vaccinated or have received only two shots. The number of infections and deaths is also unclear, as mass testing in the country has ended and China counts Covid deaths differently from most of the rest of the world. But reports of overwhelmed hospitals and funeral homes are widespread.",但尚不清楚国际游客愿意多快来到中国，也不清楚经济能从中受益多少。最近的防疫放松导致感染激增。许多中国老年群体没有接种疫苗或只接种了两针。感染和死亡人数也都不明确，因为该国的大规模检测已经结束，而中国对新冠死亡的统计口径不同于世界大部分国家。但关于医院和殡仪馆不堪重负的报道比比皆是。
"At a news conference on Sunday, an official in Zhejiang Province, home to about 5 percent of China's population, estimated that there were more than one million new Covid cases a day there.",在周日的新闻发布会上，居住着中国约5%人口的浙江省的一名官员估计，当地每日新增新冠病例超过100万。
"Dr. Huang said that while China had pursued zero Covid for too long, he was now worried that policymakers had swung too quickly in the opposite direction.","黄严忠博士表示，中国坚持""清零""太久，他现在担心政策制定者逆转政策的速度太快了。"
"""I'm afraid the mitigation strategy that is supposed to be focusing on the elderly and the vulnerable will be relegated to the back burner,"" he said.","""我担心原本应重点关注老年和弱势群体的缓解策略将被搁置一旁，""他说。"
"The speed, and shock, of China's Covid pivot was reflected on its social media platforms, where users greeted the news of the rollback on Monday with a mix of disbelief and elation. Some celebrated the fact that Chinese students studying overseas would be able to return more easily to visit their families. In the minutes after the announcement, Chinese news media reported, searches for international plane tickets on one travel platform soared.",在中国的社交媒体平台上，可以看到新冠政策急转弯的速度和冲击，周一，用户们对于政策反转的消息表达了难以置信和兴奋之情。海外的中国留学生得以更方便地回国探亲，一些人为此感到高兴。据中国媒体报道，公告一发出，某旅游平台上的国际机票搜索量就出现飙升。
"Others said, however, that they could not bring themselves to be happy about the changes, given the scale of China's outbreak and deaths. Others noted that less than one month earlier, huge swaths of cities, including Beijing, had been under lockdown.",但另一些人表示，鉴于中国疫情暴发和死亡的规模，他们无法为这些改变而高兴。还有人指出，就在不到一个月前，包括北京在内的大片城市仍处于封锁状态。
"China sent a record number of military aircraft to menace self-ruled Taiwan in a large show of force to the Biden administration, signaling that Beijing wants to maintain pressure on Taiwan even as some tensions between the superpowers are easing.",中国政府派出创纪录数量的军机威胁自治的台湾，向拜登政府显示威力。这一信号表明，即使在两个超级大国之间的紧张局势有所缓和的情况下，北京仍想继续对台湾施压。
"The swarm of Chinese fighter jets, maritime patrol planes and drones that buzzed the airspace near Taiwan in the 24-hour period leading to Monday morning demonstrated Beijing's appetite for confrontation with the United States over Taiwan, the island democracy China claims as its territory.",在周一早上之前的24小时里，成群结队的中国战斗机、海上巡逻机和无人机多次飞入台湾附近的领空，表明北京有意在台湾问题上与美国对抗。中国声称民主自治的台湾是其领土。
"The military activity which, according to Taiwan, included at least 71 Chinese aircraft came days after President Biden's latest move to expand American support for the island. Beijing has denounced the United States' effort as an attempt to contain China and interfere in its domestic affairs.",台湾称至少有71架中国飞机参与了本次军事活动，活动发生在拜登总统最近签署了军援台湾国防授权法案的几天后。 北京谴责美国企图遏制中国，干涉中国内政。
"Tensions over Taiwan have been rising in the months since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island in August, prompting Beijing to step up its activity in the area with several days of live-fire drills. China said that the exercise was aimed at honing its ability to conduct joint patrols and military strikes, but also made clear what the target was.",众议院议长佩洛西今年8月访问台湾，促使北京加强军事活动，在台湾附近进行了几天的实弹演习，那之后的几个月里，台湾的紧张局势一直在加剧。中国称这次军事活动的目的是提高联合警巡和火力打击能力，但对打击目标是什么也很明确。
"""This was a firm response to the current escalation of collusion and provocations by the U.S. and Taiwan,"" Senior Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesman for the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army, which faces Taiwan, said in a statement issued Sunday.","""这是针对当前美台升级勾连挑衅的坚决回应，""中国人民解放军东部战区新闻发言人施毅大校在周日发表的声明中说。东部战区的战略方向包括台湾。"
"A spokesperson for the National Security Council, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal operational assessments, said, ""The United States is concerned by the People's Republic of China's provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilizing, risks miscalculations, and undermines regional peace and stability.","国家安全委员会一位不愿透露姓名的发言人在讨论内部行动评估时说:""美国对中华人民共和国在台湾附近的挑衅性军事活动感到关切，这破坏了稳定，有误判的风险，也破坏了地区和平与稳定。"""
"""We will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability in line with our longstanding commitments,"" said the spokesperson.","""我们将根据我们的长期承诺，继续协助台湾，使其保有足够的自卫能力，""这名发言人说。"
"The military policy bill that President Biden signed into legislation on Friday lays out lawmakers' national security priorities for the coming year. This year, U.S. lawmakers, eyeing the protracted war in Europe and rising tensions with China, approved funding for Ukraine and authorized up to $10 billion over the next five years for Taiwan.",拜登上周五签署的军事政策法案是国会对来年国家安全优先事项的安排。今年，美国立法者出于对欧洲陷入持久战，以及与中国关系日益紧张的考虑，批准了为乌克兰提供援助，并授权在未来五年内向台湾提供最高100亿美元的军援。
"""Such a large-scale action is, of course, a response to President Biden's signing of the act,"" said Su Tzu-yun, a security analyst at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei. ""This pattern will likely continue.""","""这样子大规模的行动当然应对的是拜登总统签署国防授权法，""位于台北的国防安全研究院的安全分析师苏紫云说。""这样的模式会再延续。"""
"""The United States has walked from strategic ambiguity to constructive clarity,"" said Mr. Su, referring to the latest military legislation. ""Biden has turned Taiwan into a quasi-partner that fits the role of a security partner in his Indo-Pacific strategy.""","""美国已经从战略模糊走向建构性清晰，""苏紫云说，他指的是最新的国防授权立法。""拜登已经把台湾变成了一个符合他的印太战略的quasi-partner(准伙伴)。"""
"For years, China has sent naval and air forces into the southwest corner of Taiwan's air defense identification zone as a way to test and wear down the island's resolve against a possible military offensive. The air defense identification zone, or ADIZ, is larger than the sovereign airspace claimed by Taiwan, and serves as a unilaterally declared area in which the island's authorities claim special rights to tell aircraft to identify themselves.",多年来，中国经常派军舰和军机进入台湾防空识别区的西南角，以测试和削弱台湾抵抗可能的军事进攻的决心。防空识别区是一个比台湾声称的主权领空大的空域，台湾当局要求飞机进入这个单方宣布的空域时通报自己的身份。
"China's military flights around Taiwan have increased following Ms. Pelosi's visit, a trip that reinforced suspicion in Beijing that the United States has loosened its commitment to a ""one China"" policy. Under that policy, Washington acknowledges, but does not endorse, Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China. Washington also says that settling Taiwan's status must be done peacefully, and a 1979 law asserts that the United States may intervene if Taiwan is attacked. Chinese officials and experts say that successive American presidents have tilted toward Taiwan, while American officials say that Beijing has destabilized cross-strait relations through bellicose acts and rhetoric.","佩洛西访台加深了北京对美国放松""一个中国""政策承诺的怀疑，那之后，中国加强了在台湾附近的军事飞行。 华盛顿对""一个中国""的解释是，美国承认但不认可北京坚持的台湾是中国一部分的立场。华盛顿也说，必须用和平手段解决台湾的地位问题。根据美国1979年的一项法律，如果台湾受到攻击，美国可能会进行干预。中国官员和专家说，美国历届总统都在向台湾倾斜，而美国官员则说，北京的好战行为和言论破坏了两岸关系的稳定。"
"The latest military exercise was notable for breaking a single-day record in total number of aircraft deployed. Forty-seven out of the 71 aircraft crossedthe so-called median line, an informal boundary between the two sides, according to the Taiwanese defense ministry. Passing over the line is seen as more provocative, because the aircraft would be on a straight course over Taiwan if they did not veer away.",最近这次军演值得注意之处是打破了派出飞机数量的单日纪录。据台湾国防部称，71架飞机中有47架越过了大陆与台湾的非正式边界台湾海峡中线。越过中线被认为更具挑衅性，因为如果飞机不改变飞行航向的话，将径直飞入台湾上空。
"In a statement on Monday, the defense ministry said that the Taiwanese military was monitoring the situation and tasked its combat air patrol, Navy vessels and land-based missile systems to respond.",台湾国防部在周一的一份声明中表示，台湾军方正在监视局势，并责成其战斗空中巡逻队、海军舰艇和陆基导弹系统做出回应的准备。
"""What the Chinese Communist Party has been doing has once again highlighted its mentality of using force to resolve differences and undermine regional peace and stability,"" the Taiwanese defense ministry said in a statement on Sunday.","""中共所作所为再次凸显其以武力解决分歧、破话区域和平稳定的心态，""台湾国防部周日在声明中说。"
"Song Zhongping, a military commentator in Beijing who is a former Chinese military officer, said in an interview that the new U.S. defense legislation amounted to a test of China's boundaries. ""The People's Liberation Army would use severe military drills to warn the United States that if it insists on going its own way, there will be no peace in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.","曾任中国军官的北京军事评论员宋忠平在接受采访时说，美国新的国防立法等于是在考验中国的边界。""解放军会以严厉的军事演练的手段来警告美国，要是一意孤行下去的话，台海不会太平，""他说。"
"Taiwan has recently pushed to strengthen its own military, fueled by concerns over undertrained staff as well as newfound urgency following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. President Tsai Ing-wen will hold a news conference on Tuesday, according to the Taiwanese presidential office. She is expected to outline a plan to extend the period of military conscription from four months to a year.",台湾最近已在推动自身的军事建设，一方面是出于对军队训练不足的担忧，另一方面是俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后带来的新紧迫感。据台湾总统办公室，蔡英文总统将于周二举行记者会。预计她将提出将四个月的常备兵役军训延长至一年的计划。
"China's top leader, Xi Jinping, has in recent months tried to stabilize relations with the United States and other Western governments, which deteriorated for years over human rights issues, technology and trade tensions, as well as deepening distrust over Taiwan. But when Mr. Xi and President Biden held a face-to-face summit in Bali in November, Mr. Xi also emphasized that Taiwan's future and American support for the island remain a potential fuse of crisis, even conflict.",中国最高领导人习近平已在最近几个月试图稳定与美国和其他西方国家政府的关系，中国与西方的关系已因人权问题、技术和贸易紧张局势，以及在台湾问题上不信任的加深，多年来一直在恶化。但今年11月，习近平在与拜登在巴厘岛举行面对面峰会时，强调台湾的未来以及美国支持台湾的做法仍是危机甚至冲突的潜在导火索。
"""President Xi stressed that the Taiwan question is 'the core of the core interests of China,' the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the red line that the United States must not and should not cross,"" China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said at the time.","""习主席强调，台湾问题是中国核心利益中的核心，是中美关系政治基础中的基础，是美国不能也不应逾越的红线，""中国外交部长王毅向媒体介绍峰会情况时说。"
"Mr. Xi, like previous Communist Party leaders, has said he wants to peacefully bring Taiwan under Chinese rule but will not rule out the use of force. Many experts say the balance of armed strength across the Taiwan Strait has been shifting in China's favor, and some believe that Mr. Xi could intensify military pressure on Taiwan in coming years.",与前任中共领导人一样，习近平一直说，他希望和平收复台湾，但不排除使用武力。许多专家说，台湾海峡两岸的军事力量平衡一直在朝着有利于中国的方向发展，一些人认为，习近平可能会在未来几年加大对台湾的军事压力。
"But the Pentagon's latest annual report about the Chinese armed forces, released last month, said that attempting to seize control of Taiwan remained a daunting, and potentially devastating, gamble for Mr. Xi.",但五角大楼上个月发布的关于中国军队情况的最新年度报告称，武力收复台湾的企图对习近平来说仍然是个艰巨的、可能具有毁灭性的赌博。
"""Large-scale amphibious invasion is one of the most complicated and difficult military operations,"" the report stated. The potential setbacks and a likely wave of international opprobrium, it added, would make an invasion a ""significant political and military risk for Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, even assuming a successful landing and breakout.""","该报告称，""大规模两栖入侵是最复杂、最困难的军事行动之一。""报告还说，潜在的挫折以及可能接踵而来的国际谴责会使入侵成为""习近平和中共面临的重大政治和军事风险，即使假设登陆和越防成功的话""。"
"The introductory music was thumping, the male dating show contestant had walked onstage, and now came the interview portion, where female guests asked questions. One of the women launched right in.",喧闹的开场音乐之后，男性相亲节目嘉宾走上舞台，接下来是采访环节，女嘉宾提问。其中一位女嘉宾直接开始了。
"""Hello, sir,"" said the 59-year-old woman, Yu Xia, scrutinizing the prospect intently through her rectangular glasses. ""Is your child a son or a daughter? You said your wife died three years ago have you come out from that shadow? And your health, it's pretty good, right?""","""您好，先生，""59岁的于霞(音)说，她透过她的方框眼镜专注地审视着眼前的人。""您的孩子是儿子还是女儿?您说您夫人三年前去世了——您已经走出阴影了吗?您的健康状况还好吧?"""
Welcome to one of China's hottest new genres of television: dating shows for older people.,欢迎来到中国最热门的新电视类型之一:老年人相亲节目。
"In some ways, the programs at least 10 of which have emerged in recent years, featuring contestants mostly in their 50s and above are little different from the fare offered for younger contestants. Hopefuls discuss hobbies, strut for the camera and size up each other's appearances.",在某些方面，这些节目——近年来出现了至少10个，参加者大多在50多岁以上——与为年轻人提供的节目没有什么不同。满怀希望的嘉宾讨论爱好，在镜头前大摇大摆地走来走去，互相打量对方的外表。
"But in between the lighthearted flirtations, the programs also tackle some of the heavier realities of China's rapidly aging population, one-third of which is expected to be 60 or older by 2050. All guests are asked about their health and pensions. Often, participants are startlingly blunt about what drove them to the stage a widower recalls tender memories of his deceased wife, a divorced woman describes a loneliness so deep that she started talking to her television.",但在轻松的调情之间，这些节目也涉及中国人口迅速老龄化的一些沉重现实。预计到2050年，中国三分之一的人口将达到60岁或以上。所有的嘉宾都被问及他们的健康和养老金状况。通常，嘉宾会毫不掩饰地坦陈来参加节目的原因——一位鳏夫回忆起对已故妻子的温柔回忆，一位离异女子描述了自己深深的孤独，以至于她开始对着电视说话。
"In response to Ms. Yu's rapid-fire questions, the male guest, Li Guobin, 57, nodded. ""Time has passed; I think I've emerged. But the love hasn't been forgotten.""","57岁的男嘉宾李国斌(音)在回答于霞连珠炮式的提问时点了点头。""时间过去;我想我已经慢慢走出来了。但爱没有被忘记。"""
"""It can't be forgotten,"" Ms. Yu, also widowed, replied. ""So what you need is another partner to take care of you, right?""","""不能忘记，""同样丧偶的于霞回答说。""所以你想找个伴来照顾你，对不对?"""
"Most of all, the shows are helping to encourage more conversations about the social, romantic and sexual needs of older people. In China, as in many parts of the world, ageism has long made those topics taboo; in Chinese society in particular, many older people are expected to put the needs of younger generations first. Children often worry that a parent's decision to buck tradition and seek companionship later in life could harm their own social standing or prospects at work.",最重要的是，这些节目有助于鼓励更多关于老年人社交、浪漫和性需求的对话。在中国，就像世界上许多地方一样，年龄歧视长期以来使这些话题成为禁忌;尤其是在中国社会，对许多老年人的期待是要把年轻一代的需求放在第一位。孩子们常常担心，父母违背传统、在以后的生活中寻求陪伴的决定，可能会损害他们自己的社会地位或工作前景。
"Some contestants said they had wanted to find a partner, but were previously too embarrassed to say so, said Leng Bing, the producer of ""Not Too Late for Fate,"" one of the shows. ""But through our program, we're guiding in the right direction, and many people are becoming more understanding and open-minded,"" Ms. Leng said.","其中一档节目《缘来不晚》的制作人冷冰说，一些嘉宾说他们想找伴侣，但之前不好意思说出来。""但通过我们的项目，我们在往正确的方向上引导，许多人变得更加理解和开放，""冷冰说。"
"The problem of loneliness among older Chinese has become increasingly urgent over the years. Many Chinese, who once relied on their children to support them in their old age, now live alone because of rapid urbanization and economic development that have led their children to move away. The decades-long one-child policy also meant there are fewer children to provide companionship. More than 54 million people 65 and older are unmarried, divorced or widowed, according to China's most recent census data.",近年来，中国老年人的孤独问题变得越来越紧迫。由于快速的城市化和经济发展导致子女搬离，许多曾经依靠子女养老的中国人现在都独自生活。持续数十年的独生子女政策也意味着能够提供陪伴的孩子变少了。根据中国最新的人口普查数据，65岁及以上的未婚、离异或丧偶人士超过5400万。
"But producing dating shows for older people was not easy. Before starting production of ""Not Too Late"" in 2020, the station asked a focus group of about 20 older residents in northeastern Jilin Province, where the show is filmed, if they would be willing to participate, said Zhang Xiaoju, the program's chief editor. Fifteen said no.",但为老年人制作相亲节目并不容易。《缘来不晚》栏目的责编张晓菊说，在《缘来不晚》于2020年开始制作之前，电视台在节目拍摄地吉林省询问了由大约20名老年人组成的焦点小组，看他们是否愿意参与。15个人说不愿意。
"Still, there were a handful of eager candidates. Slowly, more followed. One retired teacher agreed immediately, noting that he had often visited ""marriage markets"" areas of public parks where older Chinese typically seek partners for their children and occasionally themselves. After he appeared on the show, others from the marriage market signed up, too.","尽管如此，还是有一些热心的报名者。人慢慢开始多起来。一名退休教师立即表示同意，并指出他经常去""相亲市场""——中国老年人在公园里为子女寻找伴侣，偶尔也为自己寻找伴侣的地方。在他上了节目后，相亲市场里的其他人也报名了。"
"""There has to be the first person who's willing to eat a crab,"" Ms. Zhang said, using a phrase to describe someone pioneering a risky path. ""Then when others see that eating crab is good, they'll be willing to pursue their own happiness, too.""","""要有第一个愿意吃螃蟹的人，""张晓菊说，这句话是用来形容开拓冒险道路的人。""然后，其他人看到螃蟹好吃，他们也会愿意追求自己的幸福。"""
"By this year, the station, Jilin Television, was fielding around 100 hopefuls a day, though filming has been put on hold recently because of coronavirus outbreaks. About half were urban residents and half rural, and about two-thirds women, Ms. Leng said. Most had high school or college educations.",到今年，吉林电视台每天要接待约100名候选人，只不过因为新冠疫情暴发，最近的摄制已经暂停。冷冰表示，嘉宾里一半是城市居民，一半是农村人，约三分之二是女性。大多数人受过高中或大学教育。
"""Care and Love,"" the program Ms. Yu appeared on, is one of the longest running dating shows for older Chinese. The program has a game-show quality, with contestants dancing or arm wrestling while potential mates press buttons to indicate approval or disapproval. The newer ""Not Too Late"" is more intimate, with candidates visiting each other's homes.",于霞参加的节目《相亲相爱》是播出时间最久的中国老年人相亲节目之一。这档节目有游戏节目的性质，选手们会跳舞或掰手腕，而潜在的伴侣则按下按钮表示认可与否。更新一点的《缘来不晚》则更强调亲密关系，会让候选人互相登门做客。
All the shows share one hallmark: blunt exchanges from candidates with little patience for nonsense.,所有节目都有一个共同特点:候选人交流直率，对废话毫无耐心。
"""What are you, a 20-something young man?"" a woman on ""Love's Choice,"" filmed in northeastern Liaoning Province, said of a man in his 70s who she thought was being too picky about appearance.","""你以为自己还是20来岁的年轻小伙吗?""在辽宁省东北部摄制的《爱的选择》中，一位女性这样说一位70多岁的男性，她认为他对外表过于挑剔。"
"On an episode of ""Not Too Late,"" a 69-year-old man asked a 63-year-old woman, ""Let me just ask, we're both experienced people: How's your sexual ability?""","在《缘来不晚》的一集中，一位69岁男性问一位63岁女性，""我就问一句，大家都是有经验的人了:你的性能力怎么样?"""
"""Not bad,"" she giggled.","""还不错，""她咯咯笑着说。"
"Exchanges like these have helped the shows attract younger viewers, who often see clips from episodes on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. Many comment that they aspire to apply the same directness in their own dating lives.",这样的对话帮助节目吸引了年轻观众，他们经常在抖音观看剧集片段。许多人评论称，他们希望自己的约会生活也能有同样的直率。
"""It's not like they're showing their best sides at first and hiding their flaws for later,"" like younger people do, said Elle Lee, a 35-year-old in Shanghai who shared a video of her favorite moments from the shows on social media. ""They'll just directly make clear their bottom line because they've lived a whole life, and they know what they can tolerate.""","和年轻人不一样，""他们不会在最开始只展示自己最好的一面，隐藏起缺点，以后再暴露出来，""35岁的上海人艾丽·李表示，她在社交媒体上分享了一段她最喜欢的节目片段集锦视频。""他们会直接明确自己的底线，因为他们活了一辈子，知道自己能忍受什么。"""
"But many young viewers, including Ms. Lee, say they only watch viral clips of the shows, not full episodes. Producers say they worry that these viral videos might overshadow the shows' more serious themes, like loneliness.",但包括艾丽·李在内的许多年轻观众表示，他们只看过网上疯转的节目片段，而不是完整的剧集。制片人表示，他们担心这些爆火视频可能会掩盖节目中更严肃的主题，比如孤独。
"On one program, a 69-year-old man said he spent so much time watching television alone that his eyesight was deteriorating. On another, after a pair of 74-year-olds shared homemade noodles, the man said it had been 20 years since someone had cooked for him.",在一档节目中，一位69岁老人说他独自看了太多电视，以至于视力都开始恶化。在另一档节目里，在两位74岁老人一起吃完家常面条后，男方说已经20年没有人为他做饭了。
"Ms. Yu, the widowed contestant, appeared on ""Care and Love"" in 2020. Since her husband and 24-year-old son had both died in 2012, Ms. Yu, from the northern city of Qiqihar, had longed for companionship, but did not know how to find it, she said in an interview.",丧偶选手于霞在2020年参与了《相亲相爱》的摄制。自2012年她的丈夫和24岁的儿子双双去世，来自北方城市齐齐哈尔的于霞在接受采访时表示，她一直渴望陪伴，但却不知如何寻找。
"She was delighted to secure a spot on the show, and when her turn came, pleasantly surprised that Mr. Li said he did not mind that she was two years older. The two walked offstage as a couple. But soon, practical considerations, amplified by old age, intruded: They lived too far apart, and his home was on the fifth floor, to which she did not want to climb, she said. (There was also a more timeless problem: He was talking to another woman.) They called it off.",她很高兴能得到上节目的机会，轮到她时，李国斌说不介意她比自己大两岁，让她很惊喜。他们俩结成伴侣走下了舞台。但很快，被老龄放大的实际考虑就出现了:两人住处离得太远，他家又在五楼，她说自己不愿意爬楼。(还有一个跟年龄没太大关系的问题:他还在和另一个女人谈。)他们就这样分开了。
"Ms. Yu said she did not regret going on the show but was unsure where to continue looking for a partner. Men still want younger women, she said. ""After it didn't work out, I did feel quite lost. I'm 61 this year,"" she said. ""Really what you worry about when you're older is that if you get sick, there's no one to care for you.""","于霞说，她并不后悔参加节目，但不确定去哪里继续寻找伴侣。她说，男人始终想要更年轻的女人。""失败之后我确实感到很失落。我今年61岁了，""她说。""当你年老的时候，你真正担心的是生病了没人照顾。"""
"Indeed, the shows are far from cure-alls for older residents' loneliness. About one-third of contestants leave ""Not Too Late"" with a match, but those who stay together comprise only about one-tenth, said Ms. Leng, the producer.",确实，这些节目远非解决老年人孤独的灵丹妙药。制片人冷冰表示，大约三分之一的嘉宾在《缘来不晚》找到了伴侣，但只有约十分之一的人能一直在一起。
"When Zhang Jinghua, a 64-year-old farmer from rural Harbin, appeared on ""Care and Love"" last year, he was so nervous that his legs shook, he recalled. His brother's family had disapproved of him looking for a partner after his wife of more than 30 years died in 2017.",来自哈尔滨农村的64岁农民张景华(音)回忆道，去年当他上《相亲相爱》节目时，他紧张得双腿发抖。与他结婚30多年的妻子在2017年去世，那之后他哥哥一家一直不赞成他寻找伴侣。
"Mr. Zhang said on the show that he just wanted someone to make dumplings with. He did not match with anyone during his episode, but the producers later broadcast his phone number and he received more than 200 calls.",张景华在节目中表示，他只想找个伴一起包饺子。他在节目中没能找到伴，但后来制片人公开了他的电话号码，他接到了200多个电话。
"To avoid his family's and neighbors' gossip, he would sneak away to meet callers he was interested in. He had not yet found a long-term partner, he said earlier this year. But when he did, he would bring her home with his head held high. ""Once I succeed, why wouldn't I dare come back?"" he said with a laugh. ""What would I have to fear?""","为了避免家人和邻居的闲话，他会偷偷溜出去见他感兴趣的对象。今年早些时候，他说自己还未能找到一个长期伴侣。但当他找到之后，他会骄傲地把她带回家。""既然成功了，我为什么不敢回来?""他笑着说。""我有什么好怕的?"""
"Since China abandoned its restrictive ""zero Covid"" policy about two weeks ago, the intensity and magnitude of the country's first nationwide outbreak has remained largely a mystery. With the country ending mass testing, case counts are less useful. The government has a narrow definition of which deaths should count as caused by Covid. Anecdotal evidence, like social media postings of hospital morgues overcrowded with body bags, is quickly taken down by censors.","自中国在大约两周前放弃了限制性的""清零""政策以来，该国首次全国性疫情的强度和规模还基本上是一个谜。随着国家结束大规模检测，病例计数的作用越来越小。政府对新冠死亡采用的是一个口径狭隘的定义。社交媒体上关于医院太平间里堆满尸袋的帖子这类传闻证据，很快就会被审查人员删除。"
"Now, a picture is emerging of the virus spreading like wildfire.",现在，出现了病毒正在像野火一样蔓延的画面。
"One province and three cities have reported Covid estimates far exceeding official tallies in recent days. At a news conference on Sunday, an official in Zhejiang Province, home to 65 million people, estimated that daily Covid cases there had exceeded one million.",最近几天，一个省和三个城市报告的新冠病例估计数字远远超过官方数据。在周日的新闻发布会上，人口6500万的浙江省的一名官员估计，该省每天的新冠病例已超过100万。
"In the eastern city of Qingdao, population 10 million, a health minister said on Friday that there were roughly half a million new cases each day, a number he expected would rise sharply in the coming days, local news sites reported.",在人口1000万的东部城市青岛，据当地新闻网站报道，一名卫生官员周五表示，每天大约有50万新病例，他预计这个数字将在未来几天大幅上升。
"In Dongguan, a city of seven million in central Guangdong Province, a city health commission report on Friday estimated between 250,000 and 300,000 new cases daily.",在广东省中部拥有700万人口的城市东莞，卫生部门周五的一份报告估计，每天新增病例在25万至30万例之间。
"And in northwestern Shaanxi Province, officials in Yulin, a city of roughly 3.6 million people, logged 157,000 infected on Friday, with models estimating that more than a third of the city's population had already been infected, according to local media.",在西北的陕西省榆林市，据当地媒体报道，周五，该市录得15.7万人感染，据模型推算，该市超过三分之一的人口已经感染。榆林市约有360万人口。
"These numbers contrast sharply with those from China's national health commission, which on Friday reported about 4,000 Covid cases for the entire country. It's also a contrast with the picture the ruling Communist Party has presented since its abrupt about-face on Covid policy in early December. Health experts and state media outlets have downplayed Covid's severity, focusing on stories of recovery rather than of severe illness. The result has been a one-sided presentation of an outbreak that some experts believe could cause over a million deaths in the coming few months.",这些数字与中国国家卫生健康委员会的数据形成鲜明对比，后者上周五报告全国新增约4000例新冠病例。这也与执政的共产党自12月初在新冠政策上突然转变以来所呈现出的景象形成了鲜明对比。卫生专家和官方媒体淡化了新冠的严重程度，专注于复苏的报道，而不是严重的疾病。其结果是对疫情的片面描述，一些专家认为，未来几个月内可能有100多万人死亡。
"China has acknowledged only seven deaths from Covid in the past two weeks and a few thousand new cases daily, which health experts call a vast undercount.",过去两周，中国只承认有七人死于新冠，每天新增数千例病例，卫生专家称这一数字被严重低估。
"On Sunday, China's national health commission announced without explanation that it would no longer provide daily Covid data. The Chinese Center for Disease Control will provide that information, the commission said, without specifying how often.",周日，中国国家卫生健康委员会在未作解释的情况下宣布，将不再提供每日新冠数据。该委员会表示，将由中国疾病预防控制中心提供相关信息，但没有说明多久提供一次。
"Karen Grepin, a public health expert at the University of Hong Kong, estimates that China could be facing tens of millions of new cases a day, based on estimates extrapolated from Hong Kong's own outbreak this year.",香港大学公共卫生专家葛瑞苹(Karen Grepin) 估计，根据香港今年的疫情推算，中国每天可能面临数千万例新病例。
"Hospitals and health care workers are facing ""never-before-seen challenges,"" according to the report from the Dongguan health commission. It said that last week more than 2,500 of the city's health workers went to work with either confirmed Covid infections or high fevers. At one Dongguan hospital, roughly half of the 3,000 health workers had been infected, according to the report.","东莞市卫生部门的报告称，医院和医护人员正面临""史无前例的严峻挑战""。它说，上周，该市有2500多名卫生工作者带病坚持上岗。报道称，在东莞的一家医院，3000名医护人员中约有一半被感染。"
"Qian Jun, deputy director of Dongguan's health center, described the overloaded health care system as ""a tragic situation.""","东莞市一个社区卫生中心的副主任钱隽称，超负荷运转的医疗系统""如此惨烈之形势""。"
"In Qingdao, makeshift medical sites were rationing health packages consisting of 10 ibuprofen tablets and two rapid antigen tests per person, according to local news media reports.",据当地新闻媒体报道，在青岛，临时医疗点向每人分发健康包，里面有10片布洛芬片和两个快速抗原检测盒。
"Jin Dong-Yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said while many countries faced issues with underreporting of major outbreaks for various reasons, such as asymptomatic cases or disincentives to report, the official tallies by China's central government were so far off as to appear disingenuous.",香港大学病毒学家金冬雁表示，尽管许多国家由于各种原因(如无症状病例或报告动机不足)而面临重大疫情漏报的问题，但中国中央政府的官方统计数据相差甚远，以至于显得不真诚。
"""That's unacceptable,"" Professor Jin said. ""They need to rectify this at some point and the earlier the better.""","""这是不可接受的，""金冬雁说。""他们需要在某个时候纠正这一点，越早越好。"""
"As the gap between official data and public perception has grown, so has online ridicule. When Heilongjiang Province reported five Covid cases early this month, one online commenter remarked that he knew all of those cases personally.",随着官方数据和公众认知之间的差距越来越大，网上的嘲笑也越来越多。本月初，黑龙江省报告了5例新冠病例，一位网友评论说，这些病例他都认识。
"Even Hu Xijin, the former editor of the Communist Party paper Global Times, criticized the official numbers. In a WeChat blog posted on Saturday, he commended the bold reporting from Qingdao, contrasting it with official case counts that ""deviated widely from the experiences of the public.""","就连中共党报《环球时报》前主编胡锡进也对官方数据提出了批评。在周六发布的公众号文章中，他点赞青岛的大胆估算，并将其与""严重背离民众的感受""的官方病例统计进行了对比。"
"Such metrics are leading to an ""erosion of credibility in official statistics,"" he wrote.","他写道，这些指标正在导致对""官方公布信息严肃性的侵蚀""。"
"China's outbreak is straining not only its government's credibility and its health care system, but also the ability to provide basic fever-reducing medications. Millions now face the prospect of going without them, as pharmacies run out of the most effective medicines. In Yulin, the authorities ordered pharmacies to ration ibuprofen and other fever-reducing medication and allowed customers to buy no more than a three-day supply.",中国的疫情不仅让政府的公信力和医疗体系承压，而且让基本退烧药物的供应也很紧张。随着药店里最有效的药物告罄，成百上千万人现在面临着无药可用的可能性。在玉林，当局要求药店限量供应布洛芬和其他退烧药，只允许顾客购买不超过三天的量。
"Some officials have gone further. At least two Chinese pharmaceutical companies told The New York Times that the authorities had seized their supplies of ibuprofen and acetaminophen, preventing them from supplying their usual customers.",一些官员走得更远。至少有两家中国药企告诉《纽约时报》，当局征用了他们的布洛芬和对乙酰氨基酚供应，导致无法向老客户供货。
"Such moves recall what happened to mask manufacturers nearly three years ago, at the start of the pandemic. The actions then appeared broader, encompassing not just Chinese-owned companies but also multinationals such as the N95 mask producer 3M, which is based in St. Paul, Minn., but has long operated a mask factory in Shanghai.",这些举措让人想起了近三年前大流行开始时口罩制造商的遭遇。当时的行动范围似乎更广，不仅包括中资企业，还包括跨国公司，如N95口罩生产商3M公司，该公司总部位于明尼苏达州圣保罗市，但在上海一直有一家口罩厂。
"Together, the shortage of medication and high case counts in far-flung cities in recent days paint a picture of a virus that is spreading far faster than experts had estimated, Professor Jin said.",金冬雁说，药物短缺和最近几天大范围城市的高病例数共同描绘了一幅病毒传播速度远远超过专家估计的画面。
"""We expected explosive outbreaks,"" he said, ""but this is much, much more devastating than the one in Hong Kong earlier this year.""","""我们已经预计到疫情会暴发，""他说，""但这次比今年早些时候在香港的疫情破坏性要大得多。"""
"The hearses bearing black and yellow funeral paper flowers crept in a steady stream toward the Dongjiao crematory in eastern Beijing. Several dozen people crowded around the closed gate waiting to be let in. A man unable to get a spot in line could only watch, wondering what to do with the body of a relative who had just died of Covid.",挂着黑色与黄色纸花的灵车缓缓驶向北京东郊殡仪馆，连绵不绝。几十号人挤在紧闭的大门口等着放行。一名占不到位置的男子只能眼睁睁看着，不知该如何处理刚死于新冠的亲人遗体。
"The hospital could not keep the body there were already too many in its morgue. When he called the crematory, an employee told him he had to wait a week. When he called again, nobody answered.",医院不能存放，因为太平间已经放不下了。当他致电殡仪馆，一名工作人员告诉他，他得等上一个星期。当他再打电话，已无人接听。
"A country trying to mourn its dead from an explosive Covid outbreak is grappling with a system unprepared for the surge in fatalities. Two weeks after China abruptly abandoned its ""zero Covid"" policy, cases have soared in cities like Beijing, along with reports of people dying.","民众尽力哀悼被大规模新冠疫情暴发夺走生命的死者，未做好准备的体系难以应对死亡人数的激增。在中国突然放弃""新冠清零""政策的两周后，北京等城市感染激增，同时还出现了死亡报告。"
"Funeral home directors and sellers of funeral supplies describe a flood of phone calls from families needing help handling the bodies of relatives. On Chinese social media, people are sharing videos and photos of morgues crowded with bodies, as well as their own personal accounts of losing loved ones to the outbreak.",殡仪馆负责人和殡葬用品销售商称，许多家庭打来电话，需要他们帮助处理亲人的遗体。在中国社交媒体上，人们分享了满是遗体的太平间的视频和照片，以及在疫情中失去亲人的经历。
"But China's government is painting a less dire picture. In its official statistics and propaganda reports, China has acknowledged only seven deaths from Covid in the past two weeks, and only in Beijing. The National Health Commission even reduced the country's cumulative Covid death toll on Wednesday by one, to 5,241. Officials have explained that China counts Covid deaths only if the virus was the direct cause of a respiratory failure a definition the World Health Organization said would lead to a vast underestimate.",但中国政府描绘了一幅没那么可怕的景象。在官方统计和宣传报道中，中国在过去两周只报告了七例死亡病例，而且都在北京。国家卫健委甚至在周三将全国累计新冠死亡数减核一例，至5241人。官员们解释称，中国仅将病毒直接导致呼吸衰竭的死因算做新冠死亡，世界卫生组织表示，这样的定义将会导致死亡人数严重少计。
"The ruling Communist Party may have a political incentive to downplay the toll of an epidemic it has suddenly stopped trying to control. Xi Jinping, China's top leader, has portrayed his country's earlier success in limiting Covid deaths as evidence of China's superiority over the West, a claim that would be hard to maintain with numerous deaths.",对于突然停止控制疫情造成的损害，执政的中共可能有政治动机进行淡化。中国最高领导人习近平将中国早些时候在限制新冠死亡上所取得的成功描绘为中国比西方优越的证据，如果死亡人数太多，这种说法就很难站得住脚。
"""If they were to publicize the death figure, it would amount to a big blow to the prestige of the party,"" said Willy Lam, an expert in Chinese politics at the Jamestown Foundation, a research group.","""如果他们公开死亡数字，将对党的威望造成重大打击，""詹姆斯敦基金会的中国政治专家林和立表示。"
"But doctors and international health experts say an underestimate of the toll risks fueling public complacency about the risks of the virus. Chinese commentators and the public have widely criticized the death toll, saying it obfuscates the real picture and hurts the government's credibility.",但医生和国际卫生专家均表示，低估死亡人数可能会助长公众对病毒风险的自满情绪。中国的评论人士和公众对死亡数字进行了广泛的批评，称其掩盖了真实情况，并损害了政府信誉。
"""These are an example of 'believing in one's own lies,'"" Mei Xinyu, an economist at a research institute affiliated with the Commerce Ministry, wrote on his social media page, commenting on a daily report of Covid figures released by the government. He later posted an announcement that the father-in-law of a prominent economist had died from pneumonia induced by Covid. The man's family, he wrote, waited hours for an ambulance to arrive and take him to the hospital.","""提供自欺欺人样本，""商务部下属研究机构的经济学家梅新育在社交媒体上这样评价政府发布的每日新冠确诊报告。后来他发了一条公告，称一位著名经济学家的岳父死于新冠引发的肺炎。他表示，死者家属等了几个小时才等到救护车将其送往医院。"
"""In the end, he could only be left on the floor of the hospital mortuary, awaiting cremation,"" Mr. Mei wrote. He said that the family was having trouble getting a cremation slot and hiring a hearse. ""The family members are heartbroken.""","""最后只能放在医院太平间的地上等待火化，""梅新育写道。他说死者家属没排到火化机会，也没有殡葬车。""家属为之心碎。"""
"As is the case elsewhere, deaths in China tend to rise in winter, because of an increase in flu and other respiratory infections, even in normal times. But people working in funeral services say they have noticed a larger increase than usual. At the Yong'an funeral services business in Shijiazhuang, a city about 200 miles southwest of Beijing, an employee said that he used to handle 10 deaths per month but is now getting calls for about five each day.",与其他地方的情况一样，即便是在正常时期，中国的死亡人数在冬季也会上升，因为流感和其他呼吸道疾病会增加。但在殡葬服务行业工作的人表示，他们发现死者比以往多了很多。在北京西南方约320公里的石家庄，永安殡葬服务中心的一名员工表示，以往他每月要办理10桩丧事，但现在每天大概都能接到五个电话。
"Some Chinese media reports have acknowledged a handful of Covid-related deaths. Wang Ruoji, a 37-year-old retired soccer star, died after a Covid infection worsened an underlying condition. Caixin, a respected news outlet, wrote that Zhou Zhichun, a former senior editor at a Communist Party newspaper, died at 77 after getting Covid, with his doctors classifying the cause as sudden cardiac death.",一些中国媒体公开报道了少数与新冠相关的死亡病例。37岁的退役足球明星王若吉因感染新冠引发基础性疾病恶化去世。受人尊敬的媒体财新报道称，一家党报的原副总编辑周志春在感染新冠后去世，享年77岁，医生诊断其死因为心源性猝死。
"But on social media, users have shared official obituaries of several other prominent people who have died in recent days, including an opera singer and an artist who helped design sports mascots. Many speculated that the true cause of these deaths was being concealed with descriptions such as ""severe cold infections.""","但在社交媒体上，用户分享了近日去世的其他知名人士的官方讣告，其中包括一名京剧演员和一名帮助设计了赛事吉祥物的美术工作者。许多人推测这些死者的真正死因都被诸如""严重感冒感染""之类的描述所掩盖。"
"At a government news conference on Tuesday, Wang Guiqiang, an infectious diseases expert, said China counts only those who died from pneumonia or respiratory failure caused by Covid in its official toll. He said that cases of fatal pneumonia are less frequent because the Omicron variant that is prevalent now infects mostly the upper airway.",在周二的政府新闻发布会上，传染病专家王贵强表示，中国官方统计死亡人数仅考虑新冠引发肺炎或呼吸衰竭致死的情况。他说因为奥密克戎变异株主要侵犯上呼吸道，患上致命性肺炎的情况很少。
"Another official explained why China revised its Covid death toll down by one this week. A review by experts determined that one death reported on Tuesday was a person who had died from other diseases, Yao Xiujun, a publicity official at the Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning, said in a phone interview.",另一名官员则解释了为何中国本周将新冠死亡病例核减了一例。北京市卫健委一名宣传官员姚秀君(音)在接受电话采访时表示，经专家审定，周二报告的死亡病例死因是其他疾病。
"China's limited definition excludes the deaths of people who had underlying diseases that were aggravated by Covid. Deaths in China are also only ascribed to Covid by panels of experts convened by hospitals, potentially leaving out people who died at home or elsewhere.",这样的狭窄判定排除了新冠导致基础疾病加重的死亡。中国对新冠死亡病例的统计也仅凭医院召集的专家组判定，这可能导致在家中或其他地方死亡的病例被遗漏。
"In contrast, the United States, Britain and Hong Kong tend to include people who died with Covid, and not just of it, to varying degrees.",相较之下，美国、英国和香港在不同程度上都倾向于统计感染新冠的死者，而不仅仅是死于新冠的病例。
"China might not be alone in its approach. In Russia, the government counts only deaths confirmed to have been directly caused by the virus.",采取这种统计方法的可能并不只有中国。在俄罗斯，政府只统计直接由新冠病毒感染导致的死亡病例。
"On Wednesday, Michael Ryan, head of health emergencies at the World Health Organization, suggested that China's definition was inadequate. ""It's quite focused on respiratory failure people who die of Covid die from many different systems failures given the severity of the infection,"" he said.","周三，世界卫生组织突发卫生事件规划执行主任迈克尔·瑞安表示，中国对新冠死亡的界定是不充分的。""中国非常重视呼吸衰竭——考虑到感染严重程度，新冠死者往往死于许多不同的身体系统衰竭，""他说。"
"China's methodology, he said, ""will very much underestimate the true death toll associated with Covid.""","他表示，中国的方法将""大大低估与新冠相关的真实死亡人数""。"
"Such an underestimate has its advantages, health experts say. It could limit public panic and reduce the burden imposed on hospitals by people who are not severely ill. Already, China has been struggling to provide supplies of ibuprofen and other fever-reducing medication as people have rushed to hoard such drugs.",健康专家表示，这种低估也有其好处。这样做可以控制公众恐慌情绪，减轻非重症患者给医院造成的负担。由于民众争相囤积布洛芬和其他退烧药，中国已经难以保障此类药品的供应。
"An underestimate could also help businesses at a time when the government has been trying to rescue an economy battered by nearly three years of disruptive lockdowns and costly testing programs. In some large cities, companies and officials are encouraging people to go to work even when mildly sick with Covid.",在政府试图挽救被近三年来的破坏性封锁和耗费大量资金的检测项目重击的经济之际，低估可能也有助于企业恢复。在一些大城市，企业和官员都鼓励民众即使是新冠轻症也要坚持上班。
"But an undercount could also backfire by undermining the government's own efforts to urge the public to take necessary precautions. Many seniors in China might continue avoiding vaccination, and younger people might take the virus less seriously than they should, said Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.",但统计不足也可能适得其反，破坏政府自身敦促公众采取必要防御措施的努力。香港大学病毒学家金冬雁表示，中国许多老年人可能还会拒打疫苗，而年轻人或许会没那么重视这种病毒。
"Professor Jin said China has for decades recorded deaths from infectious diseases narrowly, including SARS in 2003 and seasonal flu. It made an exception during the Shanghai lockdown in the spring of this year, using a looser definition as the authorities sought to justify what became a bruising, two-month lockdown.",金冬雁教授表示，中国数十年来对于传染病死亡的统计范围都很狭窄，包括2003年的非典和季节性流感。但政府在今春上海封城时破例，使用了更宽泛的定义，因为当局试图证明为期两个月的严厉封锁是合理的。
"Of the 588 Covid deaths the Shanghai city government reported, one was ascribed to a heart attack, and the rest to ""underlying conditions"" or ""tumors."" Despite this inconsistency, the National Health Commission has never expunged those deaths from the national data.","在上海市政府报告的588例新冠死亡中，一例死于心脏病，其余死于""基础性疾病""或""癌症""。尽管存在这种不一致，国家卫健委从未从全国数据中将这些死亡病例删除。"
"No matter what the official numbers depict, China is expecting a wave of deaths.",无论官方数据如何，中国都将迎来一波死亡潮。
"""Although the overall case fatality rate is low, the number of people infected is very large, so this may make the absolute number of deaths caused by this risk relatively large,"" Wang Guangfa, a respiratory specialist at Peking University First Hospital, said in an interview.","""虽然总体病死率较低，但感染人数太多，因此这一风险可能导致死亡绝对人数相对较高，""北京大学第一医院呼吸科专家王广发在接受采访时表示。"
"Already, the strain is fueling public frustration.",这样的压力已经加剧了公众的不满。
"""The funeral homes are crazily packed,"" said a Beijing resident who would only give her surname, Chen, for fear of retaliation from the government. Ms. Chen said that her grandfather died on Tuesday of Covid complications, including pneumonia and kidney failure, after being in a coma for a week.","""殡仪馆人满为患，""一位北京居民说，因为害怕政府报复，她只具陈姓。陈女士说，周二，她昏迷了一周的祖父死于新冠并发症，包括肺炎和肾衰竭。"
It took two days for Ms. Chen's family to find a funeral home in Beijing that would cremate her grandfather's body. Ms. Chen also expressed skepticism over the government's Covid statistics.,陈女士一家花了两天时间才在北京找到能火化祖父遗体的殡仪馆。陈女士也对政府的新冠统计数据表示怀疑。
"""If there are only five Covid deaths in one day, I have known nearly half of them,"" she said. ""It's heartbreaking that we Beijing people have to bear the first impact of the massive spread of the virus.""","""如果一天只有五例新冠死亡，那我都认识其中将近一半了，""她说。""我们北京人要最先承受病毒大规模传播的后果，实在是太痛心了。"""
"If brevity is the soul of wit, as some wag once said, maybe no words is the wittiest option of all. Late in November, at least 10 people died in a high-rise fire in Urumqi, the regional capital of Xinjiang, in western China. It was widely believed that Covid restrictions prevented the victims from escaping, and anger spilled into the streets, first in Urumqi and then across China, where stringent anti-Covid measures have subjected citizens to home lockdowns, constant testing and confinement in grim quarantine centers. Demonstrators appeared in cities and on college campuses, criticizing Covid policies or even denouncing the Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping. Many brandished a symbol of protest: plain, unmarked sheets of white paper.",有人曾说，简洁是智慧的灵魂，那或许，无言才是最明智的选择。11月下旬，中国西部新疆的首府乌鲁木齐市一幢高层建筑发生火灾，造成至少10人丧生。民众普遍认为，是新冠防控措施导致遇难者未能逃离，愤怒情绪蔓延至街头，首先是在乌鲁木齐，然后发展到全国各地，严苛的防疫迫使公民被封在家中，不断接受核酸检测，并被关进条件恶劣的隔离中心。城市中和大学校园里出现了示威者，他们批评新冠政策，甚至要求中共及其领导人习近平下台。许多人手里拿着一个抗议的标志:普普通通、什么都没写的白纸。
"Transfixing videos emerged. At a vigil in Shanghai, mourners held sheets of paper aloft as candles flickered. Students at Beijing's Tsinghua University wielded sheets of paper and bellowed slogans calling for democracy and freedom of expression. At another Beijing rally, a crowd waved blank paper while chanting against Covid protocols. One much-shared tweet featured someone hurling stacks of paper into the air amid city traffic. Another viral clip showed a dramatic piece of street theater: a young woman marching among pedestrians holding a sheet of paper, her mouth covered with black tape, her wrists bound with chains.",网上出现了令人惊叹的视频。在上海的一场守夜活动，哀悼者在烛光中举起白纸。北京清华大学的学生挥舞着白纸，大喊着民主和言论自由的口号。在北京的另一场集会上，一群人拿着白纸，高声反对新冠政策。一条广为流传的推文展示了有人在城市车流中向空中抛洒一叠叠白纸的场面。另一条得到大量转发的视频则显示了街头的戏剧性场面:一名年轻女子拿着一张纸在人群中游行，她的嘴上贴着黑色胶带，手腕上绑着铁链。
"Commentators were quick to interpret the meaning of the ""white-paper protests."" A blank sign is both a symbol and a tactic. It is a passive-aggressive protest against censorship, a sarcastic performance of compliance that signals defiance. Its power rests in a shared understanding, by both the public and the authorities, of the unwritten message; it rests also in the awareness that to say anything at all is to run afoul of a government that brooks no opposition, suppressing even the suggestion of an intention to speak. A tweet posted days after the fire showed a photo of a man, apparently in a Shanghai mall, holding a sign reading, ""You know what I want to say."" According to the tweet, he was taken away by the police.","评论人士很快开始解读""白纸抗议""的内涵。空白既是一种象征，也是一种策略。这是对审查制度的一种消极攻击式抗议，是一种带有讽刺意味的顺从，实际上表达了反抗。它的力量在于公众和当局对未写信息的共识;也在于这样一种认知，即只要说话，就等于是在违抗这个不能容忍任何反对意见、连发声意图都要压制的政府。火灾发生数日后的一条推文展示了照片中的身处上海某购物中心的一名男子，他举了一块牌子，上面写着:""你知道我要说什么。""那条推文称，他已被警方带走。"
"In the days after the fire, Chinese Communist Party censors moved to expunge hashtags like ""A4Revolution"" (a reference to the size of the paper) and ""white paper exercise"" from social media. A sheet of paper may be the ultimate ""analog"" artifact, but it has emerged as an unusually potent digital-age totem a meme that is rebounding in fascinating ways between the street and the virtual world. For all the tumult at the barricades, the white signs may reveal more about algorithms, data flow and the way images and ideas resonate online.","火灾发生后，中共的审查人员开始在社交媒体上删除""A4革命""(A4是纸张的尺寸)和""白纸运动""等话题。一张纸或许是最好的""类比""物，但它已成为一种异常强大的数字时代图腾——即以极为有趣的形式折返于街头和虚拟世界的米姆。尽管路障附近有种种混乱，但这些白色标志可能更多地揭示了关于算法、数据流以及影像和思想在网上引发共鸣的方式。"
"The antecedents of white-paper protests stretch back at least as far as 1924, when a Krakow newspaper reportedly published a blank special supplement as a satirical rebuke to censors. In 1965, an episode of ""Candid Camera"" featured a prank in which protesters with blank placards picketed in front of a vacant lot in New York. Four years later, students at a high school in Toronto held a mock sit-in featuring blank signs and a blank list of ""demands."" An Associated Press report about the protest bore the cheeky headline "" , Students Demand.""","白纸抗议的先例最早能追溯到1924年，据称当时克拉科夫市一家报纸出版了一份空白的特刊，作为对审查人员的讽刺谴责。1965年，《偷拍》(Candid Camera)有一集内容讲的就是抗议者的恶作剧，他们拿着空白的标语牌在纽约一处空地前聚集。四年后，多伦多一所高中的学生举行了一次模拟静坐示威，亮出了空白标语和空白的""诉求""清单。美联社给这场抗议的报道安了一个恶搞标题——《学生诉求》。"
"In retrospect, those 1960s stunts seem ideologically conservative: They were parodies, staged at the height of the civil rights era and the Vietnam War, that mocked the very idea of protest. But in recent times, citizens have turned the comedy of blank signs in the opposite direction. The signs have been used as props in pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, and by Russian opponents of the Ukraine invasion. In September, following Queen Elizabeth's death, anti-monarchy demonstrators were reportedly arrested in Scotland. Soon more protesters appeared now carrying blank signs.",回头再看，上世纪60年代的那些噱头在意识形态上似乎是保守的:那是在民权时代和越战期间矛盾最激烈之时上演的拙劣模仿，嘲讽的正是抗议的概念本身。但近年来，公民已将空白标志代表的诙谐含义反转。香港的民主示威、反对入侵乌克兰的俄罗斯人都使用过这种标志。9月，在伊丽莎白女王去世后，有报道称反君主制示威者在苏格兰被捕。很快就出现了更多举着空白标志的抗议者。
"These signs tell an absurdist joke, ridiculing both censorship and those who enforce it. They function as bait: When security forces often uniformed and well armed detain a citizen holding a blank sign, the paranoia and irrationality of state power is thrown into relief. Like a shrewd act of internet trolling, the blank sign is a button-pusher that lures its target into a revealing self-own.",这些标志都代表了荒诞的玩笑，嘲笑了审查制度及其执行者。它们就像一种诱饵:当通常穿着制服、装备精良的安全部队抓捕一位举着空白标志的公民，国家权力的妄想症和非理性就会暴露无遗。这就像网络水军的精明计谋一样，空白标志是诱使目标自我暴露的开关。
"Traditional protest symbols, like banners and flags, may have less currency in the social media age. The emblems that capture the imagination tend to be humble and unexpected, with the feel of organic memes, like the umbrellas used as shields in Hong Kong. Often, these symbols strike notes of irony and absurdity. In Thailand, pro-democracy demonstrators have embraced an even more unlikely icon than white paper: inflatable rubber ducks.",横幅和旗帜这种传统的抗议标志在社交媒体时代可能已经不再通用。激发想象力的标志往往是谦和而又出乎意料的，就像某种生动的米姆，例如在香港被当作盾牌使用的雨伞。这些符号通常带有讽刺和荒诞的意味。在泰国，民主示威者选择了一个比白纸更夸张的标志:充气橡皮鸭。
"China's blank signs have proved to be superlative meme-fodder. T-shirts have popped up featuring an illustration of Winnie-the-Pooh reading a blank page a double joke aimed at Xi Jinping, who was likened to A.A. Milne's roly-poly bear in memes that are banned on the Chinese internet. The signs have inspired more ambitious spectacles. Ai Weiwei, the exiled Chinese artist, posted an Instagram video in which he is shown writing a free-speech message on blank paper in UV invisible ink. A performance-art piece featured a woman covered in white paper being sprayed with red paint by a person in a hazmat suit reminiscent of China's P.P.E.-clad ""big whites.""","中国的空白标志已被证明是绝佳的米姆素材。印着在阅读空白纸张的小熊维尼的T恤已经出现，这是嘲讽习近平的双重笑话，将他比作A·A·米恩创作的滚圆小熊的米姆，在中国互联网上被封禁。这些标志激发了更多雄心勃勃的奇观。流亡的中国艺术家艾未未发布了一段Instagram视频，他在其中用紫外线隐形墨水在白纸上写下了关于言论自由的信息。在一场行为艺术表演中，一名身披白纸女子被身穿防护服的人——让人联想到中国裹在个人防护服之下的""大白""——喷上红漆。"
"Internet battles between protesters and the powers that be are heightened in China, where the internet is heavily censored and a surveillance dragnet sweeps up life online and off. From the moment protests erupted in Urumqi, skirmishes began between users uploading images of demonstrations and the state's censorship apparatus, which worked to obliterate all traces of them. Users employed trickery to evade the algorithms designed to catch outlawed content: They recorded videos of videos, or rotated them on their sides, or used V.P.N.s to ""store"" data on sites like Twitter and Instagram, outside the purview of Chinese censors. These efforts to find cracks in the country's ""great firewall"" have been essential to the protests. There is reason to believe they have been a success: The Chinese government has since taken steps to curb its strict Covid guidelines.","在互联网受到严格审查、天网监控着线上和线下一切日常的中国，抗议者与当权者之间的网络斗争愈演愈烈。从乌鲁木齐爆发抗议的一刻起，上传示威图片和试图抹掉所有痕迹的国家审查机器就爆发了冲突。网民试图骗过旨在捕捉非法内容的算法:他们翻录视频，或是将视频反转，要么就使用VPN在Twitter和Instagram这种不受中国审查控制的网站""存放""数据。这些在中国""防火长城""中寻找裂缝的努力对抗议活动至关重要。有理由相信他们取得了成功:中国政府此后采取措施，取消了严格的新冠防控规定。"
"Of course, protesters may still face harsh consequences, especially those who dared to voice broader critiques of China's authoritarianism. But their criticisms linger in all that white paper, blank signs that carry echoes of ideas from across decades and centuries. There is the famous paradox of John Cage: ""I have nothing to say, and I am saying it."" There's the blank page in Laurence Sterne's ""Tristram Shandy,"" and the white-on-white paintings of Robert Ryman artworks whose eloquent emptiness is pregnant with possibility, expressing the ineffable. The blank sign, for the protester who wields it and the government that disdains it, is full of potential: It is a tabula rasa, upon which every imaginable complaint, exhortation, remonstration, provocation, taunt, threat and irrefutable truth might someday be inscribed. Or maybe it's more accurate to say that those things are already written there figuratively, at least in invisible ink. The signs say nothing; they speak volumes.","当然，抗议者——尤其是那些敢对中国威权提出更广泛批评的人——仍可能面临严峻后果。他们的批判在所有白纸上挥之不去，空白的标志承载了历史长河里回荡的思想。正如约翰·凯奇那句著名的悖论:""我无话可说，而我正在说。""劳伦斯·斯特恩在《项狄传》写下了空白页，罗伯特·瑞曼画出了白底画——艺术作品中空虚的传神蕴藏着可能性，表达了不可言喻的内容。对于挥舞它的抗议者和厌恶它的政府，空白标志充满了力量:它是一块白板，但总有一天上面或许就会出现所有能想象到的抱怨、控诉、抗议、挑衅、嘲讽、威胁和无可辩驳的真理。或者更准确地说，这些东西已经被(至少是象征意义上的)隐形墨水写在上面了。空白标志什么都没说;但它们掷地有声。"
"Since China dropped its strict ""zero Covid"" policy, a joke has been making the rounds on social media about the sudden shift.","自从中国放弃严格的""新冠清零""政策以来，一个关于这种急转弯的笑话一直在社交媒体上流传。"
"Three men who don't know each other sit in a prison cell. Each explains why he was arrested:""I opposed Covid testing.""""I supported Covid testing.""""I conducted Covid testing.""","三个互不相识的人坐在牢房里。每个人解释了自己被捕的原因:""我反对做核酸。""""我支持做核酸。""""我是做核酸的。"""
"The joke has yet to be broadly censored. It is a sign of just how much the Chinese Communist Party, usually a master of messaging, is struggling to come up with a coherent explanation for the policy shift and a clear directive for what to do with an explosion of cases now threatening the country's medical resources.",这个笑话还没有遭到大规模审查。这表明，通常堪称宣传大师的中共难以对政策转变做出合理解释，也未能就如何应对威胁到国家医疗资源的感染暴发给出明确指示。
"So dizzying was the switch that even two weeks later, the state's powerful propaganda and censorship system has yet to catch up to the flood of confusion and criticism seeping through the country's typically tight internet controls.",这种转向是如此令人猝不及防，以至于两周过去了，中国强大的宣传和审查体系仍未能跟上从该国管控异常严格的互联网中流出的困惑与批评的洪流。
"Apart from laying out the new Covid rules, Chinese official media still hasn't offered much guidance from top leaders on the situation. The country's hundreds of thousands of internet censors, experts say, haven't gotten guidance on what to allow and what to delete and may be confused, given that what was blocked a month ago is now official policy. Many Chinese have been asking why they put up with years of harsh lockdowns and travel restrictions, only for the leadership to abandon them and allow the virus to spread unabated.","除了公布防疫新规，中国官媒仍未给出多少最高层对此形势的指示。专家称，因为就在一个月前还会被屏蔽的内容现已成为官方政策，该国的互联网审查大军可能陷入混乱，无法确定哪些内容被允许，哪些又需要删除。许多中国人都在问，既然高层放弃""清零""，任由病毒肆虐，那他们多年来忍受严格封锁和出行限制的意义何在。"
"For China's leadership, maintaining public trust hinges, in part, on a difficult task: finding a narrative that makes sense of the reversal.",对中国领导层而言，维持公众信任在一定程度上取决于一项艰巨任务:给这样的政策逆转找个说法。
"In the weeks since ""zero Covid"" ended, China's all-encompassing propaganda and censorship machine has fallen into its old routine of deleting negative press and spreading ""positive energy"" posts that praise the struggles of individuals and the government. But experts said the three-year trauma caused by the stringent pandemic measures and the last-minute U-turn will prove hard for people to quickly move past.","自结束""新冠清零""的数周以来，中国全盘渗透的宣传和审查机器又回到了老旧套路，即删除负面报道，传播赞扬个人和政府拼搏奋斗的""正能量""内容。但专家表示，民众很难将严苛封控造成的三年创伤和最后一刻的180度大转弯轻易抛诸脑后。"
"""It will be impossible for everyone to forget completely. Many will remember 'zero Covid' deeply and clearly"" said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies China's propaganda. However, that may not lead to widespread loss of confidence in the government, he added, noting that ""people still have ways to convince themselves that things don't seem so bad now.""","""每个人都不可能彻底忘却。很多人会深刻而清楚地记住'新冠清零'，""香港中文大学研究中国政治宣传的助理教授方可成表示。不过，这可能不会导致对政府信心的普遍丧失，他补充道，""民众依然会有办法说服自己，现在的情况可能没那么糟糕了。"""
"Thus far, propagandists have hewed to past norms in handling the crisis. They have avoided excessive mentions of the policy shift, instead emphasizing social stability. State media has sympathetically called the situation ""stressful"" but otherwise portrayed it as a well-orchestrated decision to overcome a virus that is no longer as deadly as it once was.","目前，宣传人员一直遵循过去的准则来处理这场危机。他们避免反复提及政策转变，而是强调社会稳定。官媒用同情的口吻称形势""十分紧张""，但另一方面又将之描绘为计划周详的决策，为的是克服一种不再像以前那样致命的病毒。"
"Across the country, an acute shortage of medicine, videos of people crowding hospitals, and long lines outside crematories and funeral homes marked a stark contrast with the seven deaths reported by the government this week. On Tuesday, the health authorities explained that only deaths caused by coronavirus-induced pneumonia and respiratory failure would be attributed to Covid.",全国药品短缺，民众挤满医院的视频以及火葬场殡仪馆外排长队的情况，与政府本周报告的七人死亡形成了鲜明对比。周二，卫生当局解释称，只有病毒引发的肺炎和呼吸衰竭导致的死亡才会被归因于新冠。
"Anger soon erupted online, with many accusing the authorities of double standards based on their frequent and detailed reports of Covid death statistics from overseas, particularly Europe and the United States. Many used the hashtag #WhatIsTheCriteriaForDeathByCovid in complaints on Tuesday. By Wednesday, censors had begun to block such posts.","愤怒很快在网上爆发，许多网友指责当局频繁和详尽的报告海外——特别是欧洲和美国——的新冠死亡数据是双标行为。许多人在周二发出的抱怨中使用了""#新冠死亡的判断标准""这一话题。到周三，审查人员已经开始屏蔽此类内容。"
"People wrote about their relatives' deaths, urging others not to trust propaganda that Covid is now like a flu. A blood bank appealed to college students for urgent donations. Cancellations of travel reservations for the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday surged as people decided to stay home.",人们写下的亲人去世的经历，呼吁其他人不要相信新冠和流感一样的宣传。一家血库恳请大学生紧急献血。因为人们都决定待在家中，即将到来的春节假期旅游订单的取消量激增。
"State media coverage of the country's top leadership has steered clear of the ongoing outbreak. On Monday, a commentary on People's Daily justified the new policy, saying it will bring about a ""significant positive effect"" on economic recovery. While the piece said ""a lot of work is to be done,"" it stopped short of acknowledging the chaos it created.","官媒上找不到政策突变在过去两周引发的问题。官媒对于中国最高领导层的报道对正在爆发的疫情避而不谈。周一，《人民日报》的一篇评论为新政策辩护，称这将对经济恢复带来""显著积极影响""。虽然该文章称""还有大量工作要做""，但并未承认已经造成的混乱。"
"In some ways, the approach is similar to the one taken during the initial outbreak of the virus in Wuhan nearly three years ago. At the time, even as the crisis intensified, official Communist Party mouthpieces emphasized the government's control of the situation and avoided content that could would trigger alarm. China's leader, Xi Jinping, disappeared from the public spotlight to insulate himself from potential criticism. Once the virus was contained, Mr. Xi appeared in the city triumphant.",某种程度上，这和近三年前武汉首次爆发病毒时的姿态十分相似。当时即便危机已经加剧，中共的官方喉舌仍在强调政府对局势的掌控，并避免发布可能引发恐慌的内容。中国领导人习近平从公众视野消失，以免受到潜在的批评。等到病毒传播被遏制，习近平才在武汉现身宣布胜利。
"This time, it may take longer for Chinese officials to regain the message over a medical crisis driven by a virus that has, in large countries like India and the United States, killed by the hundreds of thousands as waves of illness have overwhelmed medical facilities. Aside from general comments about coordinating Covid prevention measures, Mr. Xi has remained silent. He has said nothing directly about the recent surge in cases.",面对病毒带来的医疗危机——在印度和美国等大国，疾病暴发导致医疗设施不堪重负，造成无数死亡——这一次中国官员可能需要更长时间才能夺回叙事。除了指挥疫情防控工作的泛泛之谈，习近平始终保持着沉默。他始终没有直接提及近来的病例激增。
"For now, experts said, both the censors and the propaganda officials appear to be scrambling to figure out what to do.",专家们表示，审查人员和宣传官员似乎还在忙于拿出办法。
"""I don't think I've seen a planned or orchestrated propaganda plan coming out. It's more because the general direction has changed, so the propaganda has to follow suit suddenly,"" said Mr. Fang. One major test will come when the virus spreads to smaller, rural areas with insufficient medical resources, he said.","""我还没有看到计划周详或精心策划的宣传计划。更要紧在于大方向变了，宣传必须立马跟上，""方可成说。他表示，当病毒传播到医疗资源不足、规模较小的农村地区，将是一个重大考验。"
"A small but vocal chorus online has called out the abrupt and disjointed policy changes. Asong Yu, a 30-year-old finance worker in northeastern China, has questioned in sardonic and indirect ways the sudden changes and the lack of explanation.",网上有一小群人在大声疾呼，指出政策变化的突然和不连贯。现年30岁的中国东北金融工作者阿松·于(音)用讽刺和间接的方式质疑这种转变的突然和解释的缺失。
"In one post, Mr. Yu shared a response from viral A.I. powered chatbot, ChatGPT, to the prompt, ""are there pigs that can do a 180?"" He had particular vitriol for those he called ""epidemic prevention enthusiasts,"" nationalists who had previously parroted the government's position on ""zero Covid,"" only to be jilted by Beijing's about-face. Online he called them: ""abandoned dogs being beaten by their owners.""","阿松·于在一篇帖子中分享了爆红人工智能聊天机器人ChatGPT对于问题""有会180度旋转的猪吗""的回应。他尤为尖锐地讽刺了那些他所谓的""防疫爱好者""——即此前恪守政府""新冠清零""立场的民族主义者——如何被北京的变脸所抛弃。他在网上称他们为""被主人殴打遗弃的狗""。"
"""The previous propaganda is completely opposite to the current one. I think, however stupid some people might be, they will have to wake up,"" Mr. Yu said in an interview.","""以前的宣传和现在完全相反。我想不管一些人有多蠢，他们都不得不清醒过来，""阿松·于在接受采访时表示。"
"So far, Mr. Yu's posts have avoided the censors' knife. In part, that's because there are no obvious ways to deal with such a major about-face. Censors must decide whether to delete some portion of official posts supporting ""zero Covid"" for years and how much to tolerate a new zeal for the lifting of lockdowns.","到目前为止，阿松·于的帖子都躲过了审查者的制裁。部分原因在于，还没有明确的办法来应对如此大幅度的转变。审查人员必须决定是否要删除多年来支持""新冠清零""的部分官方内容，以及应在多大程度上容忍最近对封锁解除的狂欢。"
"Some people online have already encouraged others to go out and get Covid to build up immunity. Some college students, for instance, have lamented their inability to catch it over the past month, worrying that they will get sick during graduate school entrance exams scheduled this week.",网上一些人已经在鼓励他人外出感染新冠以增强免疫力。例如过去一个月就有些大学生抱怨自己未能感染，担心他们会在本周考研期间生病。
"The sudden change in China's policy has created chaos and confusion among the tech companies that hire their own censors, and the accounts supporting the party that toe the official line, said Eric Liu, a former censor for Weibo and now an analyst at China Digital Times, a news website tracking censorship in China.",如今在追踪中国审查制度的新闻网站《中国数字时代》担任分析师的前微博审查员刘力朋表示，中国政策的突然转向，在自行聘用审查人员的科技企业以及那些支持中共遵循官方路线的账号中制造了混乱和困惑。
"""I have yet to see a very clear, hardhanded censorship order, so I think it has something to do with the chaos that they are contradicting themselves,"" Mr. Liu said, pointing out that most likely Beijing has not figured out an official narrative. That, in turn, has prevented the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet regulator, from issuing uniform orders to censors.","""我尚未看到非常明确严厉的审查指示，因此我认为这与他们自相矛盾的混乱有关，""刘力朋说，并指出北京很可能还没有想出合适的官方说法。而这反过来又让中国互联网监管机构网信办没法向审查方发布统一命令。"
"""A regulated narrative will definitely happen, but we don't know when it will happen,"" he said.","""一定会有规范叙事，只是我们不知道何时才会出现，""他说。"
"A close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with China's top leader, Xi Jinping, on Wednesday, a sign of the countries' alignment amid Russia's deepening international isolation.",周三，俄罗斯总统普京的一个亲密盟友与中国最高领导人习近平会面，这是在俄罗斯遭国际孤立不断加深之际展现出的两国联合的标志。
"Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former Russian president and prime minister, held a previously unannounced meeting with Mr. Xi in Beijing as Chinese and Russian naval ships began weeklong joint exercises in the East China Sea.",在中俄海军于东海开始为期一周的联合军演之际，俄罗斯前总统、前总理梅德韦杰夫在北京与习近平举行了一次事先并未宣布的会晤。
"China has remained a significant, if largely silent, counterweight to the international censure of Mr. Putin. Russia has backed China's claim over the island democracy of Taiwan, and trade between the two countries has increased as the United States and Europe have imposed sanctions and sought to choke off Russia's economy.",哪怕在大多时候保持沉默，但中国仍是帮助普京对抗国际谴责的重要制衡力量。俄罗斯支持中国对民主台湾的主权主张，随着美国和欧洲实施制裁并试图扼杀俄罗斯经济，中俄之间的贸易有所增长。
"Still, China has appeared reluctant to openly support Russia's war effort in Ukraine, staying away from supplying arms or actively aiding Moscow's efforts to skirt Western sanctions.",尽管如此，中国似乎不愿公开支持俄罗斯在乌克兰发动的战争，未向俄罗斯提供武器或积极帮助莫斯科规避西方制裁。
"""Russia has tried to portray a better relationship with China than reality affords,"" said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center. ""It shows how desperate they are and how China has not been as helpful as they'd like.""","""俄罗斯试图描绘出一种高于现实的俄中关系，""华盛顿史汀生中心中国项目主任孙韵表示。""这表明了他们有多么急迫，也说明中国并没有像他们希望的那样提供帮助。"""
"Mr. Medvedev is a longtime Putin ally and has emerged as one of the government's most hawkish voices advocating a hard line against Ukraine and its allies, primarily the United States. He is the deputy chairman of Mr. Putin's security council and the head of Mr. Putin's ruling party, United Russia.",梅德韦杰夫是普京的长期盟友，是政府中最强硬的声音之一，主张对乌克兰及其盟友——主要是美国——采取强硬立路线。他是普京的安全会议副主席兼普京所在执政党统一俄罗斯党的主席。
"Mr. Medvedev said in a brief video address after the meeting with Mr. Xi that he had discussed ""cooperation between the two ruling parties"" as well as ""our strategic partnership in all spheres.""","梅德韦杰夫在与习近平会面后的简短视频讲话中表示，他谈到了""两国执政党之间的合作""，以及""我们在各个领域的战略伙伴关系""。"
"For the Kremlin, the meeting served as useful counterprogramming hours before President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was scheduled to meet with President Biden. On Monday, Mr. Putin himself met with President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus to discuss deepening economic and military ties with the close Russian ally.",对克里姆林宫来说，就在乌克兰总统泽连斯基预定与拜登总统举行会晤的几小时前，这次会面有效地转移了对前者的关注。周一，普京会见了白俄罗斯总统卢卡申科，讨论与这个俄罗斯的亲密盟国深化经济合作和军事关系。
"In Beijing, Mr. Xi told Mr. Medvedev that relations between the two countries had ""stood the test of international changes"" and that their partnership was a ""long-term strategic choice made by both sides,"" according to the state broadcaster, China Central Television.","根据国家电视台中国中央电视台报道，习近平在北京对梅德韦杰夫表示，两国关系""经受住国际风云变幻的考验""，而双方合作则是""基于各自国情作出的长远战略选择""。"
"Mr. Xi emphasized that China actively supported the idea of holding peace talks over Ukraine, and said that China hoped that ""relevant parties would exercise rational restraint"" in the crisis.","习近平强调，在乌克兰问题上，中方积极劝和促谈，并称中国希望""有关各方保持理性克制""以应对危机。"
"The military drills, annual naval exercises held since 2012, cap a year that began with China and Russia pledging a ""no limits"" partnership on the eve of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since then, Beijing has kept funds flowing to buy Russian oil as the United States and Europe impose sanctions. Though Mr. Putin referred to ""questions and concerns"" raised by Mr. Xi when they met in person in September, the countries' economic and military ties have continued to deepen.","这些自2012年以来每年都会举行的海军演习，为这友好关系""没有止境""的一年画上了句号(中俄在年初俄罗斯入侵乌克兰前夕宣布了这一承诺)。自那以后，北京在美国欧洲实施制裁之时一直通过购买石油为俄罗斯提供资金。虽然普京指出9月他与习近平会面时后者提出了""疑问和担忧""，但两国的经济和军事联系仍在继续深化。"
"The exercises, involving a Russian-guided missile cruiser and Chinese destroyers, will include joint air defense and anti-submarine activities to improve coordination and cooperation between the two navies, according to statements from both countries' foreign ministries.",根据两国外交部的声明，俄罗斯一艘导弹巡洋舰和中国驱逐舰群将参与演习，演习项目包括联合防空和反潜活动，以提升两国海军协调合作的能力。
Military cooperation between the two countries has been scaling up over the past decade even though Russia and China are not formal allies that would come to each other's defense in war. Both view the United States as their chief security threat and want to establish an alternative to the international order led by Europe and the United States.,尽管俄中并非要在战争中保卫彼此的正式盟友，但两国军事合作在过去十年间不断扩大。双方都将美国视为主要安全威胁，并希望建立一个没有欧美主导的国际秩序。
"During a discussion in Moscow in October, Mr. Putin lauded the state of relations with China, saying they had ""reached an unprecedented level of openness, mutual trust and effectiveness in recent decades.""","10月在莫斯科的一次会谈中，普京赞赏了对华关系的现状，称两国关系""在近几十年来达到了前所未有的坦诚、互信和高效水平""。"
"When demand for fever-reducing drugs more than quadrupled the price of ibuprofen, a city in eastern China began rationing sales by selling the pills individually.",对退烧药的需求导致布洛芬的价格增长了三倍多后，中国东部一座城市开始用按片出售的方式限量供应。
"When a popular Chinese online pharmacy offered the antiviral drug Paxlovid, it sold out within hours.",一家受大众喜爱的中国网上药店提供抗病毒药物Paxlovid后，几个小时就销售一空。
"And when word of the medicine shortages in China reached friends and relatives in Hong Kong and Taiwan, they quickly bought vast quantities of drugs from local sellers to ship to the mainland.",中国药品短缺的消息传到香港和台湾的亲友那里后，他们立即前往药店购买大量药品寄往大陆。
"As Covid rips through parts of China, millions of Chinese are struggling to find treatment from the most basic cold remedies to take at home to more powerful antivirals for patients in hospitals. The dearth of supplies highlights how swiftly and haphazardly China reversed course by abandoning its strict ""zero Covid"" policies about two weeks ago.","随着新冠病毒席卷中国部分地区，数百万中国人正在为寻找药物费尽心机——从家用的最基本感冒药到医院为住院患者提供的更强效抗病毒药。药物短缺凸显了中国政策逆转的速度之快和杂乱无章，政府在大约两周前放弃了严格的""新冠清零""政策。"
"The whiplash of change has caught the nation's hospitals, clinics and pharmacies off guard. Across many cities, pharmacies have sold out of the most common fever and cold medicines. Many health facilities were unprepared for the onslaught of demand from patients after they were given little to no notice about needing to stockpile drugs. The shortages are fueling anger and anxiety among Chinese who until recently had been warned by the government that an uncontrolled spread of Covid would be devastating.",政策突变使全国的医院、诊所和药店措手不及。最常见的退烧药和感冒药已在许多城市的药店售罄。许多医疗机构几乎没有或根本没有收到需要储备药物的通知，面对患者需求猛增毫无准备。药物的短缺加剧了中国人的愤怒和焦虑，直到最近，政府曾一直警告，新冠病毒不受控制地传播将是毁灭性的。
"""The doctor told me there was no fever medicine,"" said Diane Ye, a 28-year-old Covid patient in Beijing, who lined up outside a hospital for hours with a fever only to be sent home with a bottle of sore throat medicine.","""医生告诉我没有退烧药了，""北京28岁的新冠病毒感染者黛安·叶(音)说，她有发烧症状，在医院外排了几个小时的队后，医生只给她开了一瓶缓解喉咙痛的药物，就让她回家了。"
"For nearly three years, the country maintained some of the toughest pandemic controls in the world, mandating mass testing and locking down cities such as Shanghai for months. Then, with little warning, the government announced a broad easing of restrictions on Dec. 7, seemingly bowing to economic pressure and rising social discontent following widespread protests in late November.",在将近三年的时间里，中国曾保持着世界上一些最严厉的防疫措施，动不动就要求全员核酸检测，对城市进行封控，比如上海今年长达两月的封城。后来，在几乎没有任何警告的情况下，政府在12月7日宣布全面放松限制，这似乎是迫于经济压力和11月下旬各地发生抗议活动后不断上升的社会不满情绪。
"In many cities, signs of outbreaks have emerged. China reported only seven deaths from Covid so far this week, but reports of crowded crematories and funeral homes have raised concerns about the accuracy of government data. Lines of people have formed at hospitals, and medication has flown off drugstore shelves.",许多城市已出现了疫情暴发的迹象。虽然本周迄今为止，中国只通报了七例新冠病毒死亡病例，但火葬场和殡仪馆爆满的报道让人们对政府数据的准确性表示怀疑。医院里排起了长队，药店货架上的药物已卖光。
"""Opening up is great, but it happened too fast and without preparation. People don't have these common medicines stocked up at home,"" said a pharmacist working at a public hospital in Beijing who only provided his last name, Zhang, given the political sensitivity of the issue.","""放开是大好事，但来得太快，而且毫无准备。人们家里没放着这些常用药，""在北京一家公立医院工作的药剂师说道，考虑到这个问题的政治敏感性，他只说自己姓张。"
"Even before the policy pivot, stocks of fever medicines had already been low, he said, because the government had strictly controlled the sale of cold and flu medication under ""zero Covid."" The policy had required buyers to register their names, a rule aimed at preventing residents from using over-the-counter drugs to reduce fevers and avoid detection by the country's pervasive health tracking system.","他说，甚至在政策急转弯之前，退烧药的库存就很低，因为政府的""新冠清零""政策严格控制感冒药和流感药的销售。为了防止民众使用非处方药退烧，躲避国内无处不在的健康追踪系统，这些药品的购买者需要实名登记。"
"""If you ease these restrictions first, say for two months, and open up once people have stuff prepared, then this rush wouldn't have happened,"" Mr. Zhang said.","""如果，比如说你两个月前先放宽这些限制，等人们准备好药物后再放开，就不会出现这种抢购了，""张先生说。"
"Many Chinese are now confronting the specter of a massive Covid outbreak that could stretch through the winter, and have been forced to improvise to fill in the gaps. Some are turning to folk remedies like canned peaches, believing they can ward off illness. One group of volunteers organized a social media campaign to deliver aid to older adults in rural areas. The group received plenty of cash donations, but little medicine because of shortages.",许多中国人现在面临着贯穿整个冬季的大规模新冠疫情的恐慌，人们被迫想办法自救。有些人转向民间偏方，比如黄桃罐头，认为它可抵御病痛。一个志愿者群体组织了一场社交媒体活动，为农村地区的老年人提供帮助。该群体收到了足够多的现金捐款，但由于缺货，几乎没有药品捐献。
"In recent days, some Chinese have ventured across the border to Macau to receive the one thing they have less chance of finding than ibuprofen: a foreign-made mRNA vaccine. China has failed to approve such vaccines despite their availability, in an apparent effort to protect the domestic industry. (Earlier this month, Beijing said China would allow German vaccines but only for German nationals in the country.)",近日来，一些中国人为了获得一种比布洛芬更难找到的东西，冒险出境到澳门，去打外国生产的mRNA疫苗。虽然这种疫苗在国外常见，但中国尚未批准使用，显然是为了保护国内的产业。(本月早些时候，北京表示，中国将允许进口德国疫苗——但仅限于在中国的德国公民使用。)
"A data analyst in southern Shenzhen, who asked to be identified only by her last name, Fan, traveled to the nearby gambling destination last week to receive an mRNA booster. She believed that the mixture of the booster plus two doses of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine she received at home would strengthen her immunity.",深圳南部的一名只说自己姓范的数据分析师上周去澳门打了mRNA疫苗的加强针。她相信，在国内接种了两剂中国科兴疫苗后，打不同疫苗的加强针会增强她的免疫力。
"She said she began stocking up on cold medicine, saline nasal sprays and masks as early as mid-November, when cases were climbing in Guangzhou, a neighboring city. When regions across China saw shortages this month, she mailed packages with supplies to dozens of relatives in Shanghai, the northern city of Xi'an and the eastern province of Fujian.",她说，她早在11月中旬就开始囤积感冒药、生理盐水鼻喷剂和口罩，当时邻近城市广州的感染病例正在上升。中国各地本月出现了药物短缺后，她给上海、北部城市西安和东部省份福建的几十名亲戚寄去药品包裹。
"Social media users have resorted to dark humor to cope with crisis, twisting a government slogan under ""zero Covid"" that reminds people that ""Anyone who should be transferred for quarantine will be transferred for quarantine."" The new version? ""Anyone who can have Covid will have Covid.""","社交媒体用户用黑色幽默来应对这场危机，他们将政府实行""清零""政策期间进行集中隔离时使用的口号""应转尽转""改为""应阳尽阳""。"
"The government has tried to reassure the public, saying it is prioritizing efforts to increase the nation's medicine stocks.",政府试图安抚公众，称正在把增加国家的药品库存作为优先事项来抓。
"State media reports called the shortages temporary and highlighted a recent push by Chinese drugmakers, under the direction of the central government, to increase supplies. China is one of the world's largest producers of pharmaceuticals, making roughly one-third of the world's supply of ibuprofen, a painkiller and fever reducer.",官媒报道称短缺是暂时性的，并强调中国制药商最近已在中央政府的指导下全力以赴增加供应。中国是世界上最大的药品生产国之一，中国生产的布洛芬(一种止痛、退烧药)约占世界供应量的三分之一。
"Local governments are also pledging to procure more drugs and distribute them to pharmacies. In the eastern city of Nanjing, officials announced they would add two million tablets of fever-reducing medicine to the market each day, starting on Dec. 18. To stretch out supplies, pharmacies were instructed to unseal packages to sell the tablets individually and to limit purchases to six pills per person.",地方政府也在承诺采购更多药品，分发给药店。东部城市南京的官员宣布，从12月18日起，每天向市场投放200万片退烧药。为了让人们都能买到药，政府指示药店将包装拆开卖，并限制每人只能买六片。
"In the central city of Wuhan, the Hubei provincial government said it would supply three million ibuprofen tablets a week mostly to medical facilities. And in the northeastern city of Jinan, more than a million tablets of ibuprofen were distributed to clinics and pharmacies, state media reported.",位于中部城市武汉的湖北省政府表示，每周将投放300万片布洛芬，主要提供给医疗机构。另据官媒报道，东北部城市济南已向诊所和药店投放了110万片布洛芬。
China's rush to address the shortfalls in medicine mirrors the flurry of last-minute deals to bring more vaccines and foreign-made treatments onto the market.,中国在忙着解决药品短缺问题的同时，还紧急批准了几款新疫苗和外国生产的治疗药物的使用授权。
"The authorities have approved four domestic vaccines in the past two weeks alone, and the state-owned pharmaceutical company China Meheco Group announced last week it had struck a deal to import and distribute Pfizer's Paxlovid, an oral treatment found to significantly cut the risk of hospitalization and death. (In April, Pfizer had also signed a separate deal with another Chinese pharmaceutical company, Zhejiang Huahai, to manufacture Paxlovid for the China market.)",仅在过去两周的时间里，当局就批准了四种国产疫苗，国有的中国医药集团上周宣布，已达成了进口和在分销辉瑞生产的抗病毒口服药Paxlovid的协议，这种药物被证明可显著降低重症和死亡风险。(今年4月，辉瑞曾与另一家中国制药公司浙江华海药业签署了为中国市场生产Paxlovid的协议。)
"The approval of Paxlovid contrasts with China's treatment of foreign Covid vaccines. The difference in this case is that China has several domestically produced alternatives for Covid jabs, but no antiviral substitute as effective as Paxlovid.",中国批准Paxlovid的做法与对待外国新冠疫苗的做法截然不同。区别在于，中国已有几种国产新冠疫苗，但没有与Paxlovid一样有效的抗病毒药物。
"""Paxlovid fills a large gap for China to treat Covid patients with severe conditions,"" said Xi Chen, a health economist at the Yale School of Public Health. ""There is no clear competitor among China's domestic antiviral drug producers.""","""Paxlovid填补了中国治疗新冠重症的一大空白，""耶鲁大学公共卫生学院卫生经济学家陈曦说。""中国本土的抗病毒药物生产商中没有明显的竞争对手。"""
"In a sign of Paxlovid's high demand in China, boxes of the drug were quickly snapped up last week through a Shanghai-based health care company called 111, Inc. on the first day China allowed the antiviral treatment to be sold online. There have been no reports of online sales since, as the drug remains scarce.","Paxlovid在中国需求很高的一个迹象是，中国上周批准网上销售抗病毒药物的第一天，上海一家名为""1药网""的医药健康平台上的Paxlovid很快被抢购一空。之后就没有关于该药在网上销售的报道了，因为这种药物继续稀缺。"
"The clamor for medicine has even spilled out of the mainland. In Taiwan, the self-ruled island, the government has urged people to moderate their purchases for China. In the Chinese city of Hong Kong, some pharmacies are limiting how much customers can buy, while others are helping mail medicine across the border.",找药的努力甚至超出了中国大陆。在自治的岛屿台湾，政府敦促民众勿大量购买转寄中国。中国香港的一些药店正在限制顾客的购买量，而有的药店则帮忙将药物寄往内地。
"Wonderful Dispensary on Hong Kong Island charges customers roughly $15 for staff there to ship a package of pills to the mainland. Tony Ng, a clerk who has worked at the store for more than two decades, said the pharmacy was cleaned out of a popular brand of acetaminophen recently.",在位于香港岛的万事达西药房，顾客要求店员将一包药物寄往内地需交相当于大约15美元的费用。已在这家药店工作了二十多年的店员托尼·吴说，药房一个大众品牌的对乙酰氨基酚最近已售罄。
"""The customers told me that they are buying for their family and friends,"" said Mr. Ng, 50. ""People cannot buy fever medicine in mainland now. They really need it.""","""客人告诉我都是买给亲戚朋友的，""现年50岁的托尼·吴说。""他们在大陆买不到退烧药，是真的需要。"""
"At the Xiehe Hospital in the city of Wuhan, an anesthesiologist who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the foreign media said his hospital was rationing fever reducers and pain relievers to patients so it wouldn't run out.",武汉协和医院的一名麻醉师说，他所在的医院对退烧药和止痛药采取定量供应的方式提供给患者，以免用光。因为院方不允许接受外媒采访，他要求不具名。
"The shortages could have been avoided with proper planning had the government taken a more gradual approach in shifting out of its ""zero Covid"" phase, the doctor said.","如果政府在放松""新冠清零""政策时采取更渐进的做法，有适当计划的话，这种短缺本来是可以避免的，这名医生说。"
"""I never thought a 180-degree change in policy was possible. I thought it would take at least half a year to gradually relax Covid controls,"" he said. ""We are totally unprepared.""","""我完全没想到政策会是这样一个180度大转弯，一下子就给放开。我以为至少要半年，慢慢地放开，""他说。""我们完全没有准备。"""
"The growing lengths people must go to in order to secure a box of medicine are sparking anger among some who blame the government for not ensuring a smooth transition out of ""zero Covid.""",为了得到一盒药，人们必须付出越来越大的努力，这已激起了一些人的愤怒，他们指责政府没有确保平稳过渡。
"""When I see the news calling for folks to help each other, I feel it is stupid,"" said Simon Zhang, a 24-year-old Beijing resident whose girlfriend is recovering from Covid. ""They are asking us not to stockpile and suggesting dividing a box of ibuprofen into several pieces to sell Why are Chinese people always rescuing ourselves?""","""当我看到新闻号召大家民众互助时，我就觉得很愚蠢，""现年24岁的北京居民西蒙·张(音)说，他的女友感染了新冠病毒，正在康复中。""他们说什么不要囤药，把一盒布洛芬剪成小份再卖……为什么我们中国人永远都在自救?"""
"The southwestern city of Chongqing was the latest frontline of Xi Jinping's ""zero Covid"" war, until it came to epitomize China's potentially devastating about-face that has cracked the Communist Party's edifice of absolute control.","中国西南部城市重庆原本是习近平""清零""战争的最新前线，但现在成为中国疫情防控大逆转的缩影，这一转变具有潜在的毁灭性，令共产党的绝对控制制度开始出现裂缝。"
"The city last month was enduring one of the biggest outbreaks cropping up across China, when the national leader, Mr. Xi, ordered officials to continue mass testing, lockdowns and quarantines. Chen Min'er, the Chongqing party secretary, devoutly complied, closing off neighborhoods and ordering the instant construction of a quarantine hospital designed to hold up to 21,000 beds.",上个月，这座城市经历了中国最大的一次疫情暴发，当时国家领导人习近平命令官员继续进行大规模检测、封锁和隔离。重庆市委书记陈敏尔忠实地遵照执行，封锁了小区，并下令立即建造一座可容纳多达2.1万张床位的方舱医院。
"""Be resolute in fighting and winning this war of annihilation against the pandemic,"" Mr. Chen, a protege of Mr. Xi, told officials on Nov. 27. ""Not a day of delay.""","""坚决打好打赢疫情歼灭战，""11月27日，习近平的亲信陈敏尔对官员们说，""一天不耽误。"""
"But 10 days later, China suddenly abandoned the ""zero Covid"" strategy on which Mr. Xi had staked his reputation. Now the country faces a surge of infections, and Mr. Xi has left officials scrambling to manage the disarray and uncertainty.","但10天后，中国突然放弃了习近平曾赌上声誉的""清零""战略。现在中国面临感染激增，习近平的做法导致官员们忙于应对混乱和不确定性。"
"China's party-run media has cast the shift as a stressful but well-considered exit, opening the way back to good economic times. Warnings about the dangers of the coronavirus have swiftly disappeared, replaced by official claims that the Omicron variant is generally mild. By holding off from easing until now, the government has saved many lives, the People's Daily said on Thursday in a long article defending Mr. Xi's pandemic strategy as ""totally correct.""","中国党媒将这一转变描述为一场承受巨大压力但经过不断平衡抉择后的退出，为重返经济繁荣时期开辟了道路。关于新冠病毒危险的警告迅速消失，取而代之的是奥密克戎变种致病性弱的官方声明。《人民日报》周四在一篇长文中称，政府直到现在才放松政策，挽救了许多生命，并为习近平的疫情防控方针政策进行辩护，称其""完全正确""。"
"In reality, an examination of how the shift unfolded in Chongqing and elsewhere reveals a government overtaken by a cascade of Covid outbreaks, confusion over directives, economic woes and then rare political protests.",实际上，审视重庆和其他地方如何展开政策转变，显示出政府已疲于应付一连串的新冠暴发、指令混乱、经济困境以及随后罕见的政治抗议。
"Mr. Xi had contrasted his prior pandemic success with the ""chaos of the West,"" brandishing it as proof of his grand narrative of a rising China: orderly, secure, farsighted. But he had no plan for measured retreat from ""zero Covid,"" leaving a bewildered populace to improvise after three years of being micromanaged.","习近平将他之前在大流行病上的成功与""西方的混乱""进行了对比，并以此证明他对崛起中国的宏大叙事:有序、安全、有远见。但他没有计划从""清零""中有步骤地撤退，却让三年被事无巨细管理起来的困惑民众去见机行事。"
"The government is racing to approve vaccines and to obtain Western medicines after shunning them. Officials, long focused on eliminating cases, are struggling to marshal resources to treat an explosion of infections. Even the Chinese Communist Party, a virtuoso at controlling the narrative, is finding it difficult to sell the policy lurch to anxious residents.",政府现在正奋力批准疫苗并获取西药，这些都是在过去回避的事。长期以来专注于消除病例的官员们正在努力调集资源来治疗激增的感染。即使中共是控制叙事的高手，也发现很难向焦虑的居民兜售这一突然转变的政策。
"This weekend, the streets of Chinese cities remained quiet, except for throngs of people at hospitals for Covid tests or treatment, an eerie reprise of Wuhan three years ago, when that city was the first gripped by the virus.",这个周末，中国城市的街道依然安静，除了医院以外:人们排成长队接受新冠病毒检测或治疗，犹如诡异地回到了三年前的武汉，当时武汉是第一个受到病毒肆虐的城市。
"""It's overall been quite chaotic, and of course part of that is the number coming down positive about one-third of people, to judge from my friends,"" said Tan Gangqiang, a psychological counselor in Chongqing who has helped residents with the stresses of lockdowns, and now, of sudden opening.","""总体上还是比较混乱，当然也是中招的也有，将近三分之一人从身边的朋友来看，""重庆心理咨询师谭刚强说，他之前帮助居民缓解封锁带来的压力，而现在变成了缓解突然开放的压力。"
"""There are many people who have been living under the official propaganda for a long time, so after being released they feel at a loss about what to do,"" he said. ""There are even some who hope that the government will restore controls.""","""很多人因为这样的在官方的宣传长期生活，解封后他们感觉到手无足措了，""他说。""甚者还有一部分希望政府恢复管控。"""
Mr. Xi's own formula for beating back Covid may have inadvertently set China up for this jolting and potentially devastating turn.,习近平自己的抗击新冠病毒的方法，可能无意中让中国陷入了这一动荡且可能具有毁灭性的转变。
"He turned China's intense top-to-bottom mobilization against the pandemic into a showcase of the party's organizational strength. For two years, his Covid war enjoyed widespread public acceptance, but eventually the effort exhausted staff, strained local finances, and appeared to drown out attempts to discuss, let alone devise, a measured transition.",他把中国自上而下的抗疫动员变成了党组织力量的展示。两年来，他的新冠病毒战得到了公众的广泛接受，但最终这种努力使工作人员筋疲力尽，地方财政紧张，而且讨论谨慎过渡到开放的尝试也被淹没，更没有机会去设计方案。
Mr. Xi has no likely successor and could stay in power for at least another decade. But the scars from the abrupt change may feed distrust in his domineering style.,习近平没有合适的继任者，可能至少再执政十年。但突然转变所留下的伤疤可能会使人们更加不信任他的专断风格。
"""The whipsaw speed of this shift is partially the extent to which this is the decision of one man. But also it's officials trying to please that one man, and trying to run where you think he's headed sprint, in fact,"" said Jeremy L. Wallace, an associate professor at Cornell University, whose book, Seeking Truth and Hiding Facts, examines China's political transformation under Mr. Xi.","康奈尔大学副教授万家瑞说:""这种快速反转部分反映了一人专权的程度。但同时也反映了官员试图取悦那个人的程度，并试图朝着他们以为他要去的地方奔跑——实际上是冲刺。""万家瑞的书《寻求真相和隐藏的事实》(Seeking Truth and Hiding Facts)考察了习近平领导下的中国政治转型。"
A system under stress,压力下的系统
"Many sensed change was in the air after protests across Chinese cities in late November against pandemic restrictions. Few, though, expected a reversal from the ""zero Covid"" strategy enshrined as essential to protecting China's 1.4 billion people from a storm of infections.","在11月下旬中国各地城市抗议流行病限制措施后，许多人感觉到空气中弥漫着变革的气息。然而几乎没有人预料到""清零""战略会发生逆转，它被奉为保护中国14亿人口免受感染风暴冲击的必要战略。"
"On Nov. 28, during the protests, China's news agency, Xinhua, had called the strategy a ""magic weapon for victory.""","11月28日，在抗议期间，中国新闻机构新华社称""清零""方针是""制胜法宝""。"
"Around the same time, Sun Chunlan, the Chinese vice premier overseeing Covid policy, told officials to ""remain steadfast.""","大约在同一时间，负责新冠政策的中国副总理孙春兰告诉官员们要""坚定不移""。"
"Then, as she gathered on Nov. 30 with health experts and officials who had been vocal defenders of zero Covid, the tone changed.",然后，当她在11月30日与卫生专家和官员会面时，语气发生了变化。
"""Our fight against the pandemic is at a new stage and comes with new tasks,"" said Ms. Sun at the meeting of the National Health Commission. Strikingly, she didn't use the term ""zero Covid,"" one of the first hints that the country was relinquishing its long-held approach.","""我国疫情防控面临新形势新任务，""孙春兰在国家卫健委会议上说。令人惊讶的是，她没有使用""清零""一词，这是该国放弃其长期坚持的做法的第一个暗示。"
"Even before the protests, the strategy had been under severe stress. By late November, outbreaks were ripping through more than 200 cities. On Nov. 7, national authorities confirmed 5,496 Covid cases; by Nov. 27 it was nearly 40,000, a record high for daily cases in the country.",甚至在抗议之前，该战略就已经承受着巨大的压力。到11月下旬，疫情席卷了200多个城市。11月7日，国家当局确认了5496例新冠病例;到11月27日，这一数字接近4万，创下该国每日病例的历史新高。
"The pooled P.C.R. testing that was a pillar of ""zero Covid"" checking samples from 20 or more people in the same test tube as a quick, cheap way to find infections stopped working in some cities. Too many positive results were clogging the queue for follow-up tests to pinpoint the carriers. In Beijing, results were taking days to come back.","核酸混检——将20人或更多人的样本放入同一试管中进行检测，是一种快速、廉价的发现感染的方法，是""清零""政策的支柱，但在一些城市失去了意义。太多阳性结果导致为查出病毒携带者而进行的后续检测滞后。在北京，结果要几天才能出来。"
"""It was in too many cities; it was spreading too far,"" said Rodney Jones, the principal at Wigram Capital Advisors, a firm that has closely monitored China's cases. ""It was a question of when would they recognize that reality.""","""太多的城市有感染;传播得太远了，""密切关注中国疫情的威格拉姆资本顾问公司负责人罗德尼·琼斯说。""问题是他们什么时候会认识到这一现实。"""
"The economy was also battered. Shoppers stayed home, either locked down or trying to avoid quarantine for accidentally passing through a designated viral hot spot. Retail sales were down almost 6 percent in November compared with a year earlier. Housing prices continued a long slide.",经济也受到了重创。购物者待在家里，要么被封锁，要么试图避免因无意中经过划定的病毒热点地区而被隔离。与去年同期相比，11月份的零售额下降了近6%。房价继续长期下滑。
"Mr. Xi has argued that Covid controls, while burdensome, had protected China's economy and health, to the envy of the world. But the distress was starting to translate into one of the party's greatest fears: worker unrest.",习近平辩称，新冠病毒控制虽然繁重，但保护了中国的经济和健康，令世界羡慕。但这种痛苦开始转化为该党最大的恐惧之一:工人骚乱。
"In Zhengzhou in central China, thousands of workers clashed with police at an iPhone plant, angry about a delay in bonuses and the handling of an outbreak.",在中国中部的郑州，数以千计iPhone工厂的工人对延迟发放奖金和工厂对疫情的处理感到愤怒，与警察发生冲突。
"In Haizhu, a textile manufacturing district in southern China, laborers poured onto the streets over food shortages and hardships under lockdown. Migrant workers, who depend on daily work for their livelihoods, went weeks without jobs.",在中国南方的纺织制造区海珠，由于食品短缺和封锁期间度日艰难，工人们涌上街头。依靠日常工作维持生计的民工数周找不到工作。
"""I couldn't make a living this year,"" said Zhou Kaice, a street porter in Chongqing. ""Some bosses I worked for started up for a few days but were then shut by lockdowns.""","""今年找不到钱，""重庆一名街头搬运工周开策说。""我给一些老板做事，他们开几天，一遇到封控就关了。"""
"Despite the strains, officials still insisted China must win its pandemic war. Provincial leaders throughout November declared their commitment to ""zero Covid,"" often citing Mr. Xi as their lodestone.","尽管压力很大，但官员们仍然坚称中国必须赢得这场大流行战争。整个11月，省级领导人都宣布了他们对""清零""的承诺，并经常表示唯习近平马首是瞻。"
"""If pandemic controls were loosened, that would inevitably create mass infections,"" said a Xinhua editorial on Nov. 19. ""Economic and social development and the public's physical health and safety would be seriously hurt.""","""一旦放松疫情防控，势必造成大规模人群感染，""新华社11月19日的一篇社论写道。""经济社会发展和人民群众生命安全、身体健康将受到严重影响。"""
"Even if city leaders understood the challenges, Shanghai's experience stood as a warning against experimentation in Covid policy. Officials there initially tried to avoid a citywide shutdown that would drag down China's economy, preferring more fine-grained closures. One early lockdown area applied to a single milk tea shop.",即便市领导了解挑战有多么艰巨，上海的经验仍给新冠政策的执行带来了警示。当地官员起初试图避免实行会拖累中国经济的全市停工政策，更倾向于精准防控。有个早期被封锁的区域仅有一家奶茶店。
"But as cases of the fast-spreading Omicron variant multiplied, central government officials reversed course and demanded a citywide lockdown, which ended up lasting two months.",但随着高传播性的奥密克戎变异株病例成倍增加，中央政府官员改变了做法，要实施全市封锁，最终封锁持续了两个月。
"""Many officials would have looked at Shanghai and decided it's still 'zero Covid' no matter what,"" said Patricia Thorton, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Oxford. ""War is a binary you're either at war or you're not at war.""","""许多官员看到上海的情况，都决定无论如何都要继续'新冠清零'，""牛津大学研究中国政治的教授蓝梦林(Patricia Thornton)说。""战争是二元论——你要么在战争状态，要么不在。"""
Rising political anger,高涨的政治愤怒
"Ms. Sun remained insistent when she visited Chongqing in late November to inspect its pandemic measures, including the hospital under construction. The city's efforts to identify and isolate infected people were showing results, she said.",11月下旬，孙春兰访问重庆时仍态度坚决，她视察了当地的防疫措施，包括一家正在建设的医院。她说，该市发现和隔离感染者的努力正在取得成效。
"""The rapid rise of the outbreak has been effectively contained,"" Ms. Sun said, according to a report released Nov. 27, the last day of her visit.","""防控工作效率不断提升，""根据11月27日她访问最后一天发布的通告，孙春兰这样说。"
"By then, China's most widespread protests since 1989 had begun. Students, workers and homeowners in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere vented against Covid controls, angered by a fire in western China that many believed, despite official denials, had killed residents trapped in their apartments by lockdowns.",当时，中国自1989年以来最广泛的抗议活动已经开始。北京、上海和其他地方的学生、工人以及房屋业主都因中国西部的一场大火而激愤，开始表达对新冠防疫措施的不满。尽管官方否认，但许多人认为相信，封控导致了被困公寓中的居民在火灾中丧生。
"""I tell you that in this world there's only one sickness, and that's poverty and having no freedom, and we've got plenty of that,"" said a Chongqing man whose tirade went viral in China.","""世界上只有一种病，它叫不自由和穷，我们现在全占了，""一名重庆男子这样说，他的激烈发言在中国广为流传。"
"""Give me liberty or give me death,"" he shouted, using the Chinese version of the American revolutionary battle cry.","""不自由毋宁死，""他用中文喊出了美国革命的战斗口号。"
"Mr. Xi told the visiting European Council president, Charles Michel, on Dec. 1 that the protests were driven mainly by frustrated youth who had borne the brunt of lockdowns, according to two officials with knowledge of the talks. Nefarious forces, Mr. Xi added, had tried to piggyback off them to destabilize the country.",据两名知情官员透露，12月1日，习近平告诉来访的欧洲理事会主席查尔斯·米歇尔，抗议主要是由心怀不满的年轻人推动的，他们受封控影响最大。习近平还说，邪恶势力企图利用他们来破坏中国的稳定。
"But the swiftness of the government's actions belied Mr. Xi's sang-froid. Six days after the meeting with Mr. Michel, China's National Health Commission released a new set of 10 rules that effectively dismantled ""zero Covid.""","但政府的火速行动与习近平的沉着态度南辕北辙。就在他与米歇尔会面的六天后，国家卫健委发布了新十条，等于实际上废弃了""新冠清零""。"
"While economic and epidemiological realities were forcing leaders to reassess their pandemic controls, the protests appeared to heighten fear that continued restrictions would ignite more demonstrations, without stifling the virus.",尽管经济和流行病学的双重现实已经迫使领导人重新评估其防疫管控，但抗议似乎加剧了担忧，即持续的封控将引发更多示威，也不能再遏制病毒。
"""The scale of the protests really seemed to send a powerful message that 'enough is enough and it's time to change',"" said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has studied China's handling of the pandemic.","""抗议的规模似乎确实发出了一个强有力的信号，即'我们受够了，是时候改变了'，""研究中国防疫的芝加哥大学政治学教授杨大利表示。"
"In the following days, officials issued many new rules: encouraging vaccinations, setting rules for protecting old age homes and other vulnerable sites, preparing villages for infections. Their message about Covid, especially the fast-moving variant, flipped from alarm to tut-tutting at any fears.",那之后几天里，官员颁布了许多新规定:鼓励疫苗接种，设立制度保护养老院和其他易感场所，为农村感染做好准备。他们对于新冠——尤其是这种快速传播的变异株——的信号，从拉响警报反转为不足为虑。
"""The virulence of the novel coronavirus' Omicron strain has clearly fallen, and most people infected only show light or no symptoms,"" Wang Guiqiang, a medical expert, told a government news conference a day after the rule changes.","""目前新冠病毒奥密克戎毒株的致病力明显下降，感染后大部分表现无症状或者轻型，""规定变更一天后，疾病专家王贵强在政府新闻发布会上表示。"
"For now, most people are staying home, either because they have Covid or fear getting it. But if deaths rise sharply, public anger could revive. Coming infections could hinder a quick economic rebound.",目前，大多数民众仍待在家中，要么因为感染了新冠，要么因为害怕感染。但如果死亡率急剧上升，公众愤怒可能卷土重来。即将到来的感染潮也可能阻碍经济的快速反弹。
"In Chongqing, at least some medical teams have left the just-built quarantine hospital, its future use unclear. A doctor in a city hospital said on social media that ""primary care has exploded"" with Covid patients, and more than half the doctors and nurses in the respiratory disease section were infected. Mr. Chen, the city's party secretary, transferred to another city on Dec. 8, part of a wider reshuffle among local leaders.","在重庆，为数不少的医疗队已经离开了刚建成的方舱医院，该医院的未来用途尚不明确。市医院的一名医生在社交媒体上称""基层医疗已经炸了""，呼吸科感染了至少一半医护人员。12月8日，随着地方领导人的一次全面调整的进行，重庆市委书记陈敏尔被调往另一座城市。"
"""Many people have told me that I'm giving up just before dawn breaks,"" said Sisi Shi, a business owner in Chongqing who decided this month to close a restaurant she owns in another Chinese city, Dali. ""But in my judgment, even with opening up, there won't be an instant revival, because there'll be wave after wave of shocks.""","""很多人说我倒在了黎明前，""重庆的企业主史思思(音)说。她本月决定关闭自己在中国另一个城市大理开的餐馆。""但是我自己判断是，疫情即使开放，不会马上回暖，因为有一波波的冲击。"""
"They posted photos of their positive Covid tests on social media. They described their symptoms as if it were something to be celebrated: fever, cough, fatigue, body ache, loss of taste and smell. They talked about how wonderful it was to no longer be afraid of being sent to quarantine camps for infections and to no longer have to worry about neighbors being locked down for weeks as a result.",他们在社交媒体上发核酸结果呈阳性的照片。他们描述自己的症状时好像那是值得庆祝的事情:发烧、咳嗽、疲劳、身体疼痛、丧失味觉和嗅觉。他们说，很高兴不用再担心被送去隔离，不用再担心牵连邻居被关在家里数周时间。
"""Savor the moment when we are able to get sick,"" an independent bookstore owner in Beijing posted on her WeChat timeline. ""Let's protect this most humble right.""","""珍惜能生病的时光，""北京一家独立书店的老板在她的微信的朋友圈里写道。""保护这最卑微的权利。"""
"Since the government abruptly dropped its stringent ""zero Covid"" restrictions last week in the face of rare nationwide protests, much of the Chinese public has embraced a new life. They have been eager to gain back some of their basic rights, even if it means the virus is now spreading quickly.","自从全国各地罕见地爆发了抗议活动、政府于上周突然放弃严厉的""新冠清零""政策以来，许多中国老百姓已接受了新生活。他们一直渴望重新获得一些基本权利，尽管这意味着新冠病毒目前正在迅速传播。"
"But beneath the relief is a collective and profound trauma that will not be easy to heal. Gripped with grief, anxiety and depression, people want a national reckoning of what went wrong. Many are now on an almost quixotic quest in the belief that the government should acknowledge its harsh policies were a severe mistake and should apologize for the harm it has caused.",但在宽慰之下是一种集体的、难以治愈的深深创伤。被悲伤、焦虑和抑郁笼罩着的人民想对国家出了什么问题算一个总帐。一些人现在甚至近乎异想天开地认为，政府应该承认严厉的清零政策是个严重的错误，并应该为政策造成的伤害道歉。
"Li Gongming, an art historian and a former member of a political advisory group run by the Chinese Communist Party, posted an article on the social media platform WeChat, urging the government of the southern city of Guangzhou to help heal the emotional and social wounds from the pandemic.",艺术史学家、前政协委员李公明在微信上发文，敦促南方城市广州的当地政府帮助愈合疫情造成的情感和社会创伤。
"""The first step should probably start with acknowledging the mistake, offering condolences to the deceased and apologizing to the public,"" he wrote. ""It should be followed by holding people accountable and by making the government pay for compensations.""","""第一步恐怕离不开承认错误、向逝者致哀、向国民道歉，""他写道。""然后是依法问责、国家赔偿。"""
"His article, published Monday, was quickly deleted.",他周一发的文章很快就被删除了。
"Another WeChat article, under the pen name ""Banchizi,"" urged the public to hold officials accountable for the heavy cost paid under the ""zero Covid"" policy, which it called ""a silly farce.""","另一篇网名""Banchizi""的人在微信上发文，呼吁公众要求官员对""新冠清零""政策的沉重代价负责，文章把""清零""政策称为""无厘头闹剧""。"
"An apology might not suffice for some health officials who lied and misled the nation, the article said; they should be prosecuted.",文章说，对一些撒谎和误导国家的卫生官员来说，光道歉可能还不够，他们应该被起诉。
"The author urged the country to tabulate the collateral deaths those from suicides, from medical treatments that were delayed or denied, and from accidents related to the pandemic restrictions.","文章作者要求国家将清零政策的附带死亡——自杀、因延误治疗或被医院拒绝收治导致的死亡，以及与""清零""政策相关的事故死亡——统计出来。"
"China rarely releases the names and identities of the victims of tragedies thought to be connected to ""zero Covid."" One such incident was when 27 people died in a bus accident on their way to a quarantine facility in southwestern province of Guizhou. Another was when 10 people perished in an apartment fire in the western city Urumqi, an event that triggered the mass street protests last month.","中国很少公布被视为""新冠清零""次生灾害受害者的姓名。其中一起灾害发生在西南省份贵州，一辆将人们转运到集中隔离设施的大巴途中翻车，导致27人死亡。另一起发生在西部城市乌鲁木齐，一栋住宅楼的火灾导致了10人死亡，这场火灾引发了上个月全国各地的街头抗议活动。"
"Tabulating their names and how they died is the ""least respect we can pay to the deceased,"" said the article by Banchizi.","列出他们的名字和死因是""给生命一个最低限度的尊严""，Banchizi的文章写道。"
"It, too, was deleted.",这篇文章也已被删除。
"Social media users called out some of the top health experts who talked up the dangers of the omicron variant to support the government's ""zero Covid"" policy, only to change their messages after the 180-degree policy change. People circulated screenshots of different headlines of the official People's Daily in recent months, joking that the newspaper is always right on the day it is published, but it contradicts itself when it's later bound together with other editions.",社交媒体用户点了几个国内著名卫生专家的名字，这些人曾为支持政府的清零政策夸大奥密克戎变异株的危险，但在政策出现180度大转弯后，他们又改变了说辞。网上疯传官媒《人民日报》近几个月来截然不同的大标题的截图，人们开玩笑说，该报当天看都正确，但合订本就自相矛盾了。
People I interviewed told me that they want the government to apologize because it would offer some comfort for what they have endured.,接受采访的人告诉我，他们希望政府道歉，因为这能为他们承受的一切提供一些安慰。
"Zhang, a college senior in eastern Jiangsu Province who asked to be identified only by her surname, has had to take more than 100 Covid tests this year and was locked down for a total of four months, including much of the fall semester. She feels depressed, finds it hard to become motivated and cries easily when reading news about Covid.",一名要求我只写她姓张的江苏省大四学生说，她今年已被迫做了100多次核酸，前前后后被封控的时间加起来有四个月，包括秋季学期的大部分时间。她感到抑郁、消极，读到新冠病毒的新闻时动不动会哭。
"She believed the government's misinformation about the pandemic in the West, so she supported locking down Shanghai in April, a position she now regrets. Now knowing better, she wants the party to apologize to ""all the innocent people who died under 'zero Covid,' people who lost their income under lockdowns and all the people who were brainwashed by the propaganda machine,"" she said.","她曾相信政府传播的关于西方疫情的错误信息，并因此支持今年4月的上海封城。她现在对当初的立场表示后悔。她说，现在知道的更多了，她想让中共为""对于那些在清零中无辜死去、因长期封控失去收入的人以及被政治机器洗脑的所有人，政府都应该认错并道歉""。"
"Like Ms. Zhang, most people I interviewed for this column only want to be identified by a single name for safety concerns.",本专栏采访的大多数人与张女士一样，出于安全考虑要求不使用全名。
"In a normal society, for a policy mistake as severe as ""zero Covid,"" the public would demand more than an apology, said Yan, a project manager at an internet company in Beijing. ""They would have wanted a new ruling party. But it's a different matter in the Chinese context.""","北京一家互联网公司的项目经理言(音)说，在正常社会里，对像""新冠清零""这样的严重政策错误，公众要求的不会只是道歉。""岂止是道歉，还要换一个党来执政了。但在我们这个语境下不是这么回事。"""
"Everybody I talked to believes that the government should apologize, but no one expects it will. The Communist Party can only be ""great, glorious and correct,"" they said, per its own description in many official speeches. And Xi Jinping, the country's top leader, has silenced nearly all dissent and criticism of his leadership.","跟我聊过的所有人都认为政府应该道歉，但没有人指望政府会这样做。他们说，中共只能是""伟光正""，这是许多官方讲话对中共的描述。而且，中国最高领导人习近平已把对中共领导层的异见和批评几乎全部压制下去了。"
"""The call for apology is very brave, and I want it, too,"" said Yan. ""But it's very unlikely to happen.""","""这种呼声非常勇敢，我也希望能看到道歉，""言说。 ""但是小概率事件。"""
"The Communist Party has never apologized to the Chinese people for any of the atrocities they have suffered during its 73 years in power. Not after more than 20 million people starved to death during the disastrous Great Leap Forward, nor when the country was thrown into a decade of chaos and economic destruction by the Cultural Revolution. And not for the one-child policy that imposed many forced abortions and is now helping foment a demographic crisis with one of the fastest aging populations in the world.",在执政的73年里，中共从来没有为中国人民在其统治下遭受的任何残暴行为道过歉。没有为灾难性的大跃进导致逾2000万人饿死道过歉。没有为文化大革命使国家陷入长达十年的混乱和经济崩溃道过歉。也没有为独生子女政策道过歉，这项政策导致了许多强制堕胎，促使中国成为世界上人口老龄化最快并面临人口危机的国家之一。
"The party even killed a literary genre called ""scar literature,"" which emerged after the Cultural Revolution in late 1970s and portrayed the sufferings that people endured during that political campaign. The party never wants anybody to focus too much on their scars because they would inevitably ask where the scars came from, said Xu Chenggang, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China's Economic and Institutions who was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution.","中共甚至扼杀了被称为""伤痕文学""的文学类型。伤痕文学出现在文革后的20世纪70年代末，写的是人们在那场政治运动中遭受的苦难。斯坦福大学中国经济与制度中心高级研究学者许成钢说，中共从来不希望有人过度关注他们的伤痕，因为他们会不可避免地想知道伤痕是从哪里来的。许成钢曾在文革期间遭受迫害。"
"Hu Xijin, a top party propagandist, senses dangers in all the demands for an apology. In a long article on the social media platform Weibo, where he has nearly 25 million followers, he wrote that the people who called the ""zero Covid"" policy a ""man-made disaster"" are too ""radical.""","中共高级吹鼓手胡锡进意识到了要求道歉的所有危险。他在自己拥有近2500万粉丝的社交媒体平台微博上发的一篇长文中写道，将""新冠清零""政策称为""人祸""的人""偏激""了。"
"The post triggered an outcry of anger and disappointment. Many college students noted that they felt like prisoners on their campuses. A commenter from Shanghai said their child was locked down in a 600-square-foot apartment for three months. ""Isn't this something that we should reflect on? Shouldn't we try to stop this from happening again and keep the power on check?"" the commenter asked.","胡锡进的文章引发了大片愤怒和失望的声音。许多大学生指出，他们感觉自己在校园里是囚徒。一个来自上海的评论留言说，他们的孩子被关在一个55平米的公寓里三个月。""不应该反思吗?不应该杜绝这种乱象，把权力关进笼子里?""评论者问道。"
"The party has stepped in to control the narrative. In a front-page commentary on Thursday, the People's Daily, the party's official newspaper, talked up how the country is coming back to life. Then it spent more than 10,000 words praising how the party and Mr. Xi guided the country through the pandemic.",中共已加强了对叙事的控制。中共喉舌《人民日报》周四在头版发表的评论中，大谈特谈国家正在如何恢复生机，然后用了一万多字赞扬中共和习近平如何带领国家度过了新冠疫情。
"""Practice has fully proved that the Communist Party of China,"" it said, ""is the most reliable backbone of the Chinese people when storms strike.""","""实践充分证明，中国共产党，""文章写道，""是风雨来袭时中国人民最可靠的主心骨。"""
"It is a clear signal that the government will stick to its victorious messaging. It wants the public to accept its narrative, forget about what happened to them and move on.",这是一个明确的信号，表明政府将坚持宣传自己获得胜利的信息。它想让公众接受这种叙事，忘掉发生在他们身上的事情，接受现实。
Some have anticipated such moves and are determined to fight back against the collective amnesia that the nation has suffered for too long. It's their own way to cope with the trauma.,一些人对这种做法已有预料，并决心要抵制这个国家长期遭受的集体失忆症。用他们自己的方式应对创伤。
"Yu, a programmer in his mid-30s, chokes up whenever he talks about the lockdown in Shanghai in the spring of this year. ""I felt like I was knocked down by the government and hammered for three months,"" he said. ""Then it told me that it did it for the sake of my well-being.""","30多岁的程序员余(音)每当谈起今年春天的上海封城时都会哽咽。""我感觉被按在地上拿铁锤锤了三个月，""他说。""然后它还说是为了你好。"""
"He is still having two recurring nightmares. In one, he would be in a war zone full of barbed wires and filled with poisonous air. In the other, he would hear a monotonous voice repeatedly blasting from a loudspeaker, ""Come down to get tested for Covid."" Then would come his test results: negative, positive, negative, positive.","他仍有两个反复出现的噩梦。在一个噩梦里，他身处布满铁丝网和有毒空气的战区。在另一个噩梦里，他会听到大喇叭里的一个单调声音不断大喊，""下来做核酸。""然后是的检测结果:阴性、阳性、阴性、阳性。"
"He believes that it's important to write down what happened. He spent the summer on an electronic book, compiling government announcements and credible online information about what happened to the 25 million Shanghai residents between March and July. He believes that it would be obvious to anybody how much the government lied and how brutally it treated the people.",他认为把发生了事情记录下来很重要。他花了整个夏天写了一本电子书，搜集了政府的公告和可靠的在线信息，讲述了2500万上海居民今年3月到7月的遭遇。他相信所有的人都明白政府撒了多少谎，对待人民的做法有多么残酷。
"""It was like an absurd nightmare,"" he wrote in the introduction. ""I can't help but ask why tragedies like this keep happening to the Chinese people.""","""仿佛做了一个荒诞的噩梦，""他在序中写道。""不由感叹类似的悲剧为何在中国老百姓身上一再重演。"""
"LONDON China withdrew six of its diplomats from Britain on Wednesday, ending a diplomatic standoff between London and Beijing over a violent clash that took place during a pro-democracy demonstration at the Chinese Consulate in the northern city of Manchester.",伦敦——周三，中国从英国召回六名外交官，结束了伦敦和北京之间的外交僵局，这场僵局是因中国驻英国北部城市曼彻斯特领事馆门前举行民主示威期间发生暴力冲突导致的。
The British authorities had asked six Chinese diplomats to waive their official immunity to allow police to investigate how a protester from Hong Kong was injured after being dragged onto the consulate grounds and beaten on Oct. 16.,10月16日，一名香港抗议者被拖进领事馆的地盘并遭到殴打而受伤，英国当局要求六名中国外交官放弃官方豁免权，以便警方展开调查。
"Instead, China decided to repatriate the six officials, including one of its senior diplomats, the consul general, Zheng Xiyuan. He has denied that he beat a protester, though not involvement in the incident.",然而，中国决定召回这六名官员，其中包括一名高级外交官、总领事郑曦原。他否认自己殴打了抗议者，但没有否认参与该事件。
"In a statement, the Chinese Embassy said Mr. Zheng's return to China was part of ""a normal rotation of Chinese consular officers.""","在一则声明中，中国大使馆表示郑曦原回中国属于""中方正常的人员轮换""。"
"The episode underscored the growing tension between the two nations as the British government hardens its policy toward Beijing, while still trying to engage with the Chinese government. Against the backdrop of China's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, Britain had offered visas to tens of thousands of residents of its former colony, a move that angered the authorities in Beijing.",随着英国政府对北京变得强硬，同时仍努力与中国政府接触，这一事件凸显了两国之间日益紧张的关系。在中国镇压香港民主抗议者的背景下，英国向其前殖民地的数万名居民提供了签证，此举激怒了北京当局。
"In a speech last month, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain said that the ""golden era"" in relations with China was at an end, identifying the country as a ""systemic challenge to our values and interests.""","在上个月的一次演讲中，英国首相里希·苏纳克表示，与中国关系的""黄金时代""已经结束，并将中国认定为""对我们的价值观和利益的系统性挑战""。"
"He stopped short, however, of describing China as a threat and said that Western nations should work with Beijing on shared challenges such as climate change and the health of the global economy.",然而，他没有将中国描述为威胁，而是说西方国家应该与北京合作应对气候变化和全球经济健康等共同挑战。
"The diplomatic moves on Wednesday seemed in line with that carefully calibrated policy, resolving the incident in Manchester without formally expelling the Chinese diplomats from Britain. Such a step might have provoked a response from China and increased tensions.",周三的外交行动似乎符合这一经过精心调整的政策，曼彻斯特事件在没有正式将中国外交官驱逐出境的情况下得到了解决。驱逐举动可能会激起中国的回应，并加剧紧张局势。
"Speaking in London, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said that a deadline for action set by Britain over the case had expired on Wednesday.",英国外交大臣詹姆斯·克莱弗利在伦敦发表讲话说，英国就此案设定的行动期限已于周三到期。
"""In response to our request, the Chinese government have now removed from the U.K. those officials including the consul general himself,"" Mr. Cleverly said. ""This demonstrates that our adherence to the rule of law, the seriousness with which we take these incidents, has had an effect and we will continue on the world stage and domestically to abide by the rule of law and expect others to do likewise.""","""应我们的要求，中国政府现已从英国召回那些官员，包括总领事本人，""克莱弗利说。""这表明我们对法治的坚持，我们对这些事件的严肃态度，已经产生了影响，我们将继续在世界舞台和国内遵守法治，并期望其他国家也这样做。"""
"Mr. Cleverly added that it was ""right that the Chinese government have now removed these officials from the U.K.""","克莱弗利补充说，""中国政府现在将这些官员从英国召回是正确的。"""
"After the clash in Manchester, Bob Chan, the pro-democracy protester at the center of the dispute, told British media that, while demonstrating outside the consulate, he was dragged inside its grounds and attacked.",在曼彻斯特的冲突发生后，处于冲突中心的民主抗议者鲍勃·陈告诉英国媒体，他在领事馆外示威时被拖到领事馆内并遭到袭击。
"""I held on to the gate, where I was kicked and punched. I could not hold on for long and was eventually pulled into the grounds of the consul. It was then my hair was pulled, and I felt punches and kicks from several men,"" Mr. Chan told a news conference, adding that the assault only stopped when a man who turned out to be a uniformed officer from the Greater Manchester Police pulled him outside the gate.","陈先生在新闻发布会上说，""我抓住大门时被拳脚相向。我没能抓住多久，最终被拉进了领事馆。这时，我的头发被拉扯，觉得有几个人对我拳打脚踢。""他还说，直到一名男子将我拉出大门，袭击才停止，原来那是大曼彻斯特警察局的一名穿制服的警官。"
"""I never thought that something like this could happen in the U.K.,"" he added.","他还说:""我从没想过在英国会发生这样的事情。"""
"Speaking to Sky News, Mr. Zheng denied beating anybody but, when asked if he pulled Mr. Chan into the consulate by his hair, he accused the protester of abusing his country and leader, adding: ""I think it's my duty.""","在接受天空新闻采访时，郑曦原否认打人，但当被问及他是否抓住陈先生的头发将其拉进领事馆时，他指责抗议者辱骂他的国家和领导人，并补充说:""我认为这是我的责任。"""
"In a statement issued on Wednesday by the Inter Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international group of legislators, Mr. Chan said that ""while it may have taken two months for this to happen, I believe this is one way of solving this complicated diplomatic problem.""","在国际立法者团体""对华政策跨国议会联盟""在周三发表的一份声明中，陈先生说:""虽然花了两个月的时间才走到这一步，但我相信这是解决这一复杂外交问题的一个方式。"""
"""I relocated to this country with my family to live freely. What happened on 16 October 2022 was unacceptable and illegal, and the withdrawal of these Chinese diplomats gives me a sense of closure,"" he added.","他还说:""我和家人搬到了这个国家是为了自由地生活。2022年10月16日发生的事情是不可接受的，也是非法的，这些中国外交官的召回让我感觉事件已经结束了。"""
"In its statement, the Chinese Embassy accused Britain of failing to ""protect the safety and dignity"" of the consulate. It called the protesters ""violent rioters"" and accused them of assaulting consulate personnel.","在声明中，中国大使馆指控英国未能""保护中方总领馆馆舍和人员安全与尊严""，还将抗议者称为""暴徒""，并且指控他们袭击中方总领馆人员。"
"The departures were not enough to satisfy some of the most vocal critics of China in Britain's Parliament, including Iain Duncan Smith, a senior Conservative Party lawmaker. He is one of a number of members of the British Parliament who has been sanctioned by China for spreading what it said were ""lies and disinformation"" about human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.","对于英国议会中一些对中国最直言不讳的批评者，这些外交官的召回还不足以让他们感到满意，其中包括保守党资深议员伊恩·邓肯·史密斯。他是受到中国制裁的多名英国议会成员之一，中国称他们散布所谓侵犯新疆少数民族人权的""谎言和虚假信息""。"
"""The flagrant assault on a peaceful democracy campaigner in Manchester needs more than allowing those responsible to leave the U.K. uncharged and with their heads held high,"" Mr. Duncan Smith said in a statement. ""Letting China take them back isn't justice. We should have kicked them out weeks ago.""","""曼彻斯特一位和平的民主活动人士公然遭受攻击，负有责任的人没有受到指控还昂着头离开英国，这样的处理是不够的，""邓肯·史密斯在一份声明中说。""让中国将他们召回是不公正的。我们应该在几周前就把他们赶出去。"""
"Since China dramatically reversed course and loosened its zero-tolerance approach to Covid last week, Beijing has gone all out to convince the public that it can weather the potential risks of lifting restrictions and still put the world's second-largest economy back on track.","自从中国上周180度急转弯，放松了""新冠清零""政策以来，政府一直在竭尽全力让公众相信，国家能经受住解除防控措施的潜在风险，并能让世界这个第二大经济体的经济重回正轨。"
"Its once bleak prognostications have turned downright optimistic: Covid-19 is entering the ""last stage"" and will soon become a manageable seasonal illness, said one of China's leading voices on the coronavirus. The virus's spread will peak in a month, predicted another prominent Chinese epidemiologist. A top state TV news anchor declared that ""we are on the road"" to ending the crisis, with the latest Covid variants less dangerous and officials saying the country's medical preparedness will protect against the most catastrophic outcomes.","政府对疫情曾经悲观的预言已转变成极为乐观，国内新冠病毒方面的一位主要专家说，疫情正在进入""最后一程""，很快会变成一种可控制的季节性疾病。另一位著名的中国流行病学家则预测，新冠病毒将在一个月内达到感染峰值。中央电视台的一位著名新闻主播宣称，""我们正式迈向了结束疫情生活的道路。""官员们纷纷表示，新冠病毒最新变异株的致病性已经降低，国家有充足的医疗准备，能防止出现最灾难性的后果。"
"Despite those assurances, China faces much uncertainty over how the coming months will play out. Information is opaque and unreliable, which will make it difficult to gauge Beijing's handling of the coming wave of Covid infections. The government's desire to save face after an embarrassing retreat from its hallmark pandemic policy will only muddy the picture.","尽管有这些保证，中国在未来几个月将发生什么仍有很多不确定性。信息的不透明和不可靠让人们难以判断中国政府应对正在出现的一波新冠病毒感染浪潮的做法。政府在尴尬地放弃了标志性的""新冠清零""政策后要挽回面子的想法只会使情况变得更加难辨。"
"Already, there are signs that China is leveraging propaganda to reinforce its message that the situation is under control. And absent a reliable flow of information, businesses and investors from outside the country are left to speculate on just how long it will take for the economy to recover.",已经有迹象表明，中国正在动用宣传工具来强化一个信息，即国内局面已得到控制。由于缺乏可靠的信息流动，来自国外的企业和投资者只能猜测中国经济复苏将需要多长时间。
Even the most basic question of how many people are infected with Covid in China right now is hard to answer because the government has relaxed mass testing requirements and made reporting at-home test results voluntary.,就连中国目前有多少人感染了新冠病毒这个最基本的问题也很难回答，因为政府放松了大规模核酸检测的要求，允许在家使用抗原检测的人自愿报告结果。
"China reported 2,291 newly confirmed cases on Tuesday, a fraction of the roughly 30,000 new infections a day that the country was reporting before it lifted the mass testing requirement. Case numbers are bound to be suppressed even further after China's National Health Commission said on Wednesday that it would stop reporting asymptomatic infections, which made up the vast majority of positive results in the past.",中国周二通报了2291例新增确诊病例，这个数字是取消大规模核酸检测要求之前每天通报的约3万例新增病例的零头。国家卫生健康委员会周三表示将停止通报无症状感染者，今后的确诊病例数注定会偏低，因为以前的确诊病例中核酸阳性的无症状感染者占大多数。
"The downturn in the number of reported infections belies anecdotal evidence of a surging number of positive cases and crowded hospitals with people waiting to be treated. With the change in testing policy, many cities and counties across the country are spreading the mantra of ""don't get tested unless necessary"" on official social media. ""The statistics are meaningless,"" said Jorg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.","通报的感染病例降低，与阳性人数激增的传闻以及医院里挤满了候诊者的情况不符。随着检测政策的变化，全国许多市县正在其官方社交媒体帐号上传播""非必要不检测""的口号。""官方的统计数据毫无意义，""中国欧盟商会会长伍德克(Jörg Wuttke)说。"
"Some of China's data stretches the boundaries of reason for a country with a population of 1.4 billion people. China said there had not been a single Covid-related death since it lifted pandemic restrictions six days ago. By comparison, the United States reported 469 Covid-related deaths on Tuesday alone.","对一个拥有14亿人口的国家来说，中国的一些统计数据超出了合理的界限。中国称，自从六天前放松了""新冠清零""政策以来，还没有出现一例与新冠病毒相关的死亡。相比之下，美国仅在周二一天就有469例与新冠肺炎相关的死亡病例。"
"Since the early months of the pandemic, virologists have raised questions about China's official mortality figures, challenging the way that the country's hospitals classify Covid deaths. Instead of including people who died after contracting Covid-19 in official data, as is the norm in other countries, Chinese hospitals typically attribute deaths to pre-existing or chronic illnesses, such as cancer or a heart condition, they said.",从新冠病毒大流行的最初几个月起，病毒学家就一直怀疑中国官方通报的死亡数据，对中国医院定义新冠病毒死亡的方式提出了质疑。病毒学家说，其他国家的标准是将感染了新冠病毒后死亡的人都包括在死亡病例统计中，但中国的官方数字不包括这些死亡，中国医院通常将这些人的死因归于已有的基础病或慢性病，例如癌症或心脏病。
"Underreporting Covid cases is not unique to China, but the country remains especially inscrutable. In reporting ""severe"" bouts of Covid, the government discloses only the change in the number of cases from the day before, without reporting a total figure. China said it had three more severe cases on Tuesday than on Monday.","漏报新冠病毒死亡病例的国家不只是中国，但中国的数据尤其让人难以捉摸。政府通报的新冠病毒""重症""病例数只给出与前一天相比的变化，不报病例总数。中国周二通报的重症病例比周一多三例。"
"The lack of reliable data on Covid cases also makes it hard to assess how long it will take the economy to bounce back. The global picture is not looking promising, with both the United States and Europe charting a path toward recession, hurting demand for Chinese exports, a usually dependable pillar of the global economy.",缺乏新冠感染病例的可靠数据也让人很难评估恢复经济将需要多长时间。全球的经济形势看来并不乐观，美国和欧洲的经济都有出现衰退的可能，这会损害对中国商品出口的需求，中国的出口通常是全球经济的一个可靠支柱。
"Under China's no-holds-barred Covid policy, the constant threat of lockdowns and unpredictable quarantines also kept shoppers out of stores, tethered travelers to their homes and discouraged diners from eating out for the better part of three years. But even if customers are now allowed to go out freely, there is still a great deal of trepidation about what lies ahead.","中国不惜一切代价实行""新冠清零""政策时，人们曾面临着什么时候会被封控、会被集中隔离无休止的威胁，让购物者不愿去商店购物，让人们不能出门旅行，也让民众在近三年的时间里不愿外出就餐。尽管现在已允许人们自由出入，但民众仍对未来会发生什么非常惶恐。"
"Zheng Jingrong, a shop owner who sells handmade imported clothes in Beijing, said she hadn't bothered to reopen her store yet because there were still no customers.",北京一家销售进口手工服装的店主郑景蓉(音)说，她不打算重新开张，因为仍然没有顾客光临。
"""My feeling now is that everyone is afraid of testing positive, and those who are timid dare not go out,"" she said. Relaxing the country's Covid rules is a good first step, but the government needs to do more to support ordinary people and small businesses, Ms. Zheng said, adding that ""nothing is certain at the moment.""","""现在的感受就是大伙都怕阳了，胆小的就不敢出门，""她说。虽然中国放松严格的""新冠清零""政策是个良好的开端，但政府需要采取更多措施支持普通人和小企业，郑女士说，""目前没有什么确定性。"""
"Ting Lu, chief China economist for Nomura, a Japanese brokerage, said he wasn't ""too optimistic"" about a sharp recovery in the Chinese economy, because he expects continued disruptions from an overwhelmed health care system and a surge in infections. He added that he expected pent-up demand in the economy to be ""relatively weak"" next year after three years of lockdowns depleted the finances of many Chinese households.","日本券商野村证券首席中国经济学家陆挺表示，他对中国经济会很快复苏不""太乐观""，因为他预计，感染激增和不堪重负的医疗体系将继续给经济造成破坏。他还说，预计被压抑的需求对明年经济的刺激作用会""相对较弱""，因为近三年的封控已耗尽了中国许多家庭的积蓄。"
"Part of the uncertainty hanging over how China will emerge from ""zero Covid"" is that no country of this size has pivoted this quickly, this drastically shifting seemingly overnight from full-on assault against Covid to learning to live with the virus. Long-established rules are changing by the day.","在一定程度上，笼罩在中国如何走出""新冠清零""头上的不确定性在于，没有一个如此大的国家如此迅速、彻底地改变做法，中国从竭尽全力遏制新冠病毒到学会与病毒共存的转变，似乎发生在一夜之间。执行了很久的规定每天都在变。"
"As of last week, asymptomatic or light cases no longer required hospital stays. All restrictions on purchasing flu and pain relief medication were also lifted, igniting a run on fever pills and even some traditional Chinese medicines. On Tuesday, China also disabled a travel tracking app, one of many smartphone apps that the government used to keep tabs on the whereabouts of Chinese citizens to assess their Covid risk.",从上周开始，无症状或轻症感染者不再需要住院治疗。政府取消了禁止药店出售感冒药和止痛药的所有限制，导致药店的退烧药甚至一些中成药被抢购一空。中国周二还停止了行程码的使用，那是一款政府为了评估人们接触新冠病毒的风险，用来跟踪人们旅行的手机应用之一。
"Two months ago, before throngs of people took to the streets to protest the government's draconian Covid policies, Xi Jinping, China's leader, said Covid posed such a grave public health risk that fighting the virus required an ""all-out war.""","两个月前，很多人走上街头抗议政府严厉的""新冠清零""政策的活动还没有发生，那时，中国领导人习近平曾表示，因为新冠病毒对公共卫生构成的严重风险，有必要对病毒展开一场""全面战争""。"
"""It's amazing how in two weeks the entire control system has evaporated,"" Mr. Wuttke said. ""What does this do to business? I don't know.""","""整个防控系统在不到两周的时间里消失，令人大为惊奇，""伍德克说。""这对企业有什么影响?我不知道。"""
"Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said when Australia and New Zealand abandoned their zero-Covid ambitions last year, they were able to do so somewhat successfully because they had implemented ""effective vaccination programs with effective vaccines.""","爱丁堡大学传染病流行病学教授马克·伍尔豪斯表示，澳大利亚和新西兰去年放弃他们追求的清零目标时，他们之所能在一定程度上取得成功，是因为他们已""使用有效疫苗开展了有效的疫苗接种计划""。"
"However, in the case of China, both of those factors are in doubt. In China, roughly two-thirds of people over 60 and only 40 percent of people over 80 have received a booster shot. The World Health Organization has said the boosters are critical when it comes to China's homegrown vaccines, which use inactivated virus and are shown to be less effective than foreign alternatives that use newer mRNA technology.",但对中国情况而言，疫苗的有效性和接种计划的有效性都值得怀疑。中国60岁以上的人口当中大约三分之二打了疫苗加强针，而80岁以上的老年人中只有40%打了加强针。世界卫生组织认为，打加强针对中国国产疫苗至关重要，因为国产疫苗使用的是灭活病毒，已被证明不如使用新的mRNA技术的外国疫苗有效。
"On Wednesday, China's health regulator said it was rolling out a second vaccine booster for high-risk groups and people over 60.",中国政府周三表示，将在感染高风险人群、60岁以上老年人群中开展第二剂次加强免疫接种。
"Without extensive coverage and a highly effective vaccine, there is the ""potential for a very big public health problem,"" Mr. Woolhouse said.","疫苗覆盖范围不广、缺少高效力疫苗，""有引发重大的公共卫生问题的可能""，伍尔豪斯说。"
"For Zhu Yan, who owns a hostel by Qionghai Lake, a tourist destination in Sichuan Province, the Covid restrictions had damaged her business. She said there were still no visitors because people are afraid of contracting the virus. While it may take some time for the economy and her business to recover, she said she was at least feeling hopeful again.",朱艳(音)在四川省旅游胜地邛海湖畔拥有一家小旅馆，新冠病毒防控措施曾让她的生意受损。她说现在仍没有游客，因为人们害怕感染病毒。尽管经济和生意的恢复可能还需要一段时间，但她说，她至少再次感到了希望。
"Ms. Zhu, 40, said she was hoping that China could reach herd immunity so that life could return to normal. In fact, she hopes to test positive soon because she figures it is better to get Covid early on.",现年40岁的朱女士说，她希望中国能够实现群体免疫，让生活恢复正常。事实上，她希望自己能快点阳，因为她觉得最好早点感染新冠病毒。
"""It is impossible to lock everyone up at home and lock them up forever, right?"" Ms. Zhu said. ""What should come will come, you can't escape. You have to take this path, and everyone has to take this step, so that China can get on with normal work and life.""","""不可能把所有人关死在家里，永远关住，对不对?""朱女士说。""该来的就会来的，你跑不掉的。你必须要走这条路，大家都要踏出这一步，中国才能恢复正常的，工作生活各方面。"""
"JIUQUAN SATELLITE LAUNCH CENTER Thirty years ago, the Chinese government initiated a secret plan for its space program, including a key goal of building a space station by 2020.",酒泉卫星发射中心——30年前，中国政府启动了一项秘密太空计划，其中包括到2020年建立一个空间站的主要目标。
"At the time, the country was 11 years from sending its first astronaut into space, and its space efforts were going through a rough patch: Chinese rockets failed in 1991, 1992, 1995 and twice in 1996. The worst failure, in 1996, was a rocket that tipped to the side, flew in the wrong direction and exploded 22 seconds after launch, showering a Chinese village with falling wreckage and flaming fuel that killed or injured at least 63 people.",当时距离中国将首名航天员送入太空还有11年的时间，且它的航天事业正在经历一个艰难的阶段:中国的火箭在1991年、1992年、1995年和1996年(两次)先后遭遇发射失败。最严重的是1996年的一次发射，火箭向一侧倾斜，飞向错误的方向，并在发射22秒后爆炸，残骸和燃烧的燃料四溅，落在了一个中国村庄，造成至少63人死伤。
"While grand spaceflight plans of some nations have ended up many years behind schedule, China completed the assembly in orbit of its Tiangong space station in late October, only 22 months later than planned. And on Nov. 29, the Shenzhou 15 mission blasted off from China's Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center deep in the Gobi Desert and took three astronauts to the space station to begin permanent occupancy of the outpost.",一些国家的宏大航天计划经历了数年的拖延，但中国在10月底完成了天宫空间站的轨道组装，仅比计划晚了22个月。11月29日，神舟十五号从位于戈壁滩的中国酒泉卫星发射中心发射升空，并将三名航天员送往空间站，开始长期在轨驻留。
"These human spaceflight achievements, combined with recent space probes to the moon and Mars, add to the evidence that China is running a steady space marathon rather than competing in a head-to-head space race with the United States. That China's space program is making good time toward its long-term goals was reinforced during a rare visit for foreign media to the country's heavily guarded desert rocket base for the Nov. 29 launch including lengthy interviews with senior Chinese space officials by in for The New York Times.",这些载人航天成就，加上近些年对月球和火星的太空探索，进一步证明了中国正在稳步进行一场太空马拉松，而不是与美国进行正面交锋的太空竞赛。中国的太空计划正在向其长期目标大步迈进，在外媒罕见地获邀造访这个戒备森严的沙漠火箭基地，观摩11月29日的发射的过程中，这一点得到了进一步印证，《纽约时报》在此期间对中国高级航天官员进行了长时间的采访。
The Pentagon predicted in August that China would surpass American capabilities in space as soon as 2045.,五角大楼方面在今年8月预测，中国最快于2045年超越美国的太空能力。
"""I think it's entirely possible they could catch up and surpass us, absolutely,"" said Lt. General Nina M. Armagno, the staff director of the United States Space Force, at a conference in Sydney the day before the launch of Shenzhou 15. ""The progress they've made has been stunning stunningly fast.""","""我认为他们完全有可能赶超我们，绝对有可能，""美国太空军参谋长尼娜·M·阿玛尼奥中将在神舟十五号发射前一天在悉尼举行的一次会议上说道。""他们的进步令人震惊——速度快得惊人。"""
"China's program left the starting line in 1986, decades after the height of the U.S.-Soviet space race. That was when Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader then, approved Project 863, a science and technology development program that included plans for a crewed spacecraft.",中国的太空计划始于1986年，彼时美苏太空竞赛的高潮已经过去了几十年。中国时任最高领导人邓小平批准了863计划，那是一个高科技研究发展计划，其中包括载人航天器。
"The program began to pick up speed in 1992 with Project 921. ""The goal set back then was to complete the construction of the Chinese space station around 2020,"" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's crewed space program.","1992年，随着921工程的启动，中国的太空计划开始提速。""当年定的目标就是要在2020年前后完成中国空间站的建造，""中国载人航天工程总设计师周建平说。"
"Despite initial embarrassment as rockets kept blowing up instead of reaching space, China picked up the pace in the years that followed. American companies, looking for an inexpensive way to put satellites into space, helped China fix its rocket quality problems. In 2003, Boeing ended up agreeing to pay $32 million in fines for violations of American arms exports controls by a company that it had acquired, Hughes Space and Communications.",尽管最初由于火箭不断爆炸而没有进入太空让中国陷入尴尬境地，但在接下来的一些年里，中国加快了步伐。四处寻找能以成本低廉的方式将卫星送入太空的美国企业帮助中国解决了火箭质量问题。2003年，波音最终同意缴纳3200万美元的罚款，因为它收购的休斯航天通信公司违反了美国的武器出口管制。
"Congress ended up banning American space agencies in 2011 from spending any money to cooperate in space with China, except in limited circumstances. The ban, enacted in response to worries about technology theft and human rights violations, blocked any chance of inviting China to join the International Space Station.",国会最终在2011年禁止美国的航天机构动用任何资金与中国展开太空方面的合作，仅有少数例外。这项禁令是出于对窃取技术和侵犯人权的担忧而颁布的，完全截断了邀请中国加入国际空间站的机会。
"Frank Wolf, the retired Republican congressman who pushed through the legislation, said in a recent email that he still believed the legislation was needed. ""Bottom line, we should not be collaborating with China,"" he said.","推动这项立法的退休共和党议员弗兰克·沃尔夫最近在一封电子邮件中表示，他依然认为此举是必要的。""归根结底，我们不该与中国合作，""他说。"
"China has also tapped into Russian expertise extensively over the years, going back to the founding of Jiuquan in 1958 as a military base for the development of China's first intercontinental ballistic missiles. Spacecraft carrying the Shenzhou missions strongly resemble Russia's Soyuz spacecraft.",从1958年将酒泉定为中国首批洲际弹道导弹研发的军事基地开始，中国多年来还广泛利用了俄罗斯的专业知识。承载神舟任务的飞船与俄罗斯的联盟号飞船看起来非常相似。
The country's space officials say that every component of their spacecraft is made in China. But they acknowledge having benefited from cooperation over the years with their northern neighbor.,中国航天官员宣称飞船的所有部件均由中国制造。但他们也承认，多年来与北方邻国的合作令人受益。
"""China's manned spaceflight has also had a lot of exchanges with Russia in the process of development 100 percent localization does not mean that there is no exchange or cooperation,"" Mr. Zhou said.","""中国载人航天在发展的过程中也和俄罗斯有过很多交流，百分之百的国产化并不意味着我们在技术上不交流不合作，""周建平表示。"
China is now pursuing its own programs and has not partnered with Russia for its new space station.,中国目前正在推进自己的航天项目，没有与俄罗斯合作建设新的空间站。
"Having already made big strides in space in recent years, a half dozen Chinese space officials outlined their plans for the coming years in interviews at the launch center, which sits in a vast, frozen expanse of gray gravel in northwestern China, almost four hours' drive from the nearest large town.",近年来，中国太空事业已经取得长足进展，六名中国航天官员在发射中心接受采访时介绍了未来几年的规划。该中心坐落于中国西北部一片广袤冰冷的灰色荒漠中，距离最近的大城市有近四小时的车程。
"The Tiangong space station weighs nearly 100 tons. That is barely more than the American Skylab that launched in 1973, and it is less than the Mir space station that the Soviet Union began assembling in space in 1986.",天宫空间站重达近百吨，比1973年发射的美国天空实验室空间站略重，轻于苏联1986年开始在太空组装的和平号空间站。
"Tiangong is being portrayed by state media to the Chinese public as a three-bedroom home in the sky. Still, it is a lot smaller than the International Space Station, which is about 450 tons and has sleeping space for seven.","官媒向中国公众描述的天宫空间站是一个""三居室""的天空之家。尽管如此，它还是比国际空间站小得多，后者重约450吨，有可供七人使用的睡眠空间。"
"What the Chinese space station may lack in heft, Chinese officials are trying to offset with efficient management of space a polite phrase for crowding in astronauts and experiments. But space experts in the West have also suggested that the I.S.S. is bigger than it needs to be, particularly given the miniaturization of computers and other scientific equipment since its development began in 1994.",或许该空间站重量不足，但中国官员正在试图用高效的空间管理来弥补——这是把宇航员的生活环境和实验环境挤在一起的礼貌说辞。但西方航天专家也表示，国际空间站的规模超出实际需要，特别是考虑到自1994年开始建设以来，计算机和其他科学设备都已经小型化。
"Starting with the arrival of the three Shenzhou 15 astronauts on Nov. 30, China now plans for its space station to be occupied continuously by at least three astronauts. That will expand to six astronauts during their weeklong overlap every six months when a replacement crew arrives still short of the International Space Station's usual complement of seven astronauts.",从11月30日三名神舟十五号宇航员抵达空间站开始，中国现在计划维持空间站始终有至少三名宇航员入驻的状态。每六个月都会有轮替人员抵达，在为期一周的交接期，空间站容纳的宇航员将达到六人——仍然低于国际空间站常规容纳的七人。
"Ji Qiming, assistant director general of the China Manned Space Program's engineering office, said that the Shenzhou 15 astronauts would first debug equipment aboard the newly completed space station. They will ""complete the unlocking, installation and testing for 15 scientific experiment racks and carry out more than 40 space science experiments and technical tests in the field of space science research and applications, space medicine, space technology and so forth,"" he said, without providing specifics.","中国载人航天工程办公室主任助理季启明表示，神舟十五号宇航员将首先在新建成的空间站上调试设备。他们将""完成15个科学实验机柜解锁、安装和测试，开展空间科学研究与应用航天医学、航天技术等领域的40余项空间科学实验和技术实验""，他说道，但没有披露细节。"
"With efficient space management, the Chinese space station will offer four-fifths as many racks for experiments as the International Space Station does, Mr. Zhou said. One of the experiments will be an extremely cold atomic clock.",周建平表示，通过高效的空间管理，中国空间站提供的实验机柜数量将会是国际空间站的五分之四。其中一项实验内容将是极冷原子钟。
"""This can play a very good role in some basic physics research, such as non-Newtonian gravitation and gravitational redshift"" research, he said.","""这个可以对一些基础物理方面的研究起到很好的作用，比如说非牛顿引力、引力红移等，""他说。"
"As soon as next year, the space station will also have a separately launched telescope, Xuntian, orbiting nearby to survey the universe at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths in many ways, a more sophisticated version of NASA's 32-year-old Hubble Space Telescope.",最快到明年，该空间站还将单独发射巡天号空间望远镜，在附近轨道上以光学和紫外线波长观测宇宙——在许多方面上，这种观测要比美国宇航局运行了32年之久的哈勃空间望远镜更加精密。
"""The characteristic of the sky survey telescope is that it can do large-scale sky surveys we plan to complete surveying 42 percent of the sky's area in 10 years,"" Mr. Zhou said. ""We expect that it can obtain some very important results, especially that our telescope should be unique in the world in the ultraviolet wavelengths.""","""巡天望远镜的特点就是可以做大范围的巡天测量，我们计划是用10年的时间完成大概42%的天区的巡天，""周建平说。""我们可以期待它可以获得一些很重要的成果，特别是我们这个望远镜在紫外波段，应该是全球独一无二的。"""
"The Shenzhou 15 team are set to conduct three or four spacewalks in the coming months as well, Mr. Ji said. They will also use a new robotic cargo airlock that allows scientific experiments to be put out into the frozen vacuum of space.",季启明表示，神舟十五号的乘组人员还将在未来几个月进行三到四次太空行走。他们还将用上新型货物气闸舱，可以在冰冷的太空真空中进行科学实验。
"""It will reach a very low level of temperature so that we can study some very important phenomena in fundamental physics, such as Bose-Einstein condensate,"" Mr. Zhou said, referring to a condensed state of matter only found at temperatures close to absolute zero.","""它会达到一个非常低的温度的水平，这样我们可以研究基础物理中的一些非常重要的现象，比如玻色–爱因斯坦凝聚这一类的问题，""周建平说，指的是在接近绝对零度的状态下才能发现的物质凝聚态。"
"Despite limited direct cooperation, Chinese officials say that they have learned important lessons by watching their American counterparts. Chinese officials are glad, for example, that they did not follow an early decision by NASA in the 1970s: to build a large but costly space plane like the space shuttle.",尽管直接合作有限，中国官员仍表示，通过观察美国同行的工作，他们已经吸取了重要教训。例如，中国官员对于没有遵循美国宇航局在20世纪70年代的一项早期决定感到满意:即打造一架像航天飞机一样大型但昂贵的太空飞机。
"Instead, they have been impressed by the work of Elon Musk's rocket company.",相反，他们对伊隆·马斯克的火箭公司的成就印象深刻。
"""In 2009, when I first learned about SpaceX in a meeting in the U.S., I was surprised: I never heard of this company when I was in the U.S. before, how did it grow into such a large company so quickly,"" Mr. Zhou said.","周建平说:""我最早和SpaceX接触，是在2009年在美国的一个会上……我很惊讶:我以前在美国的时候从来没有听说过这家公司，它竟然这么快就成长为这么大的公司。"""
"From watching SpaceX, China's space officials see value in making reusable rockets and spacecraft.",通过SpaceX，中国航天官员看到了制造可重复使用的火箭和航天器的价值。
"""The space shuttle is very complicated,"" Mr. Zhou said, while the capsules China and SpaceX are using are ""relatively easier technologically to ensure reliability and safety, and it is also more economical."" He later asserted that, ""within a few years, we will be able to achieve the reuse of re-entry capsules for our new generation spaceships.""","""航天飞机非常复杂，""周建平说，而中国和SpaceX使用的太空舱""技术上更容易保证可靠，安全也更为经济""。他随后还断言，""我相信几年内我们就可以实现我们的新一代飞船的返回舱的重复使用。"""
Developing reusable rocket technology in China has become even more important following considerable international criticism of its Long March 5B rockets. China allowed massive core boosters from these rockets to fall out of control to Earth while sending each of the three modules of the Tiangong space station into orbit.,中国长征五号乙火箭遭到国际上的大量批评后，开发可重复使用的火箭技术变得更加重要。中国在将天宫空间站的三个模块分别送入轨道的过程中，让这些火箭的大型核心助推器不受控制地落到地球上。
"R. Nicholas Burns, the United States ambassador to China, said in an interview that he had encouraged China ""to be more cautious about the uncontrolled re-entry of large rocket bodies.""","美国驻华大使尼古拉斯·伯恩斯在接受采访时表示，他曾敦促中国""在大型火箭体失控重返大气层方面更加谨慎""。"
"China has bristled at criticism of the Long March 5B's core boosters. One caused damage during a test flight in 2020 when it fell in West Africa, but none of the rocket stages have hurt or killed anyone so far. At least one more launch of the rocket is planned in 2023, when the Xuntian telescope goes to orbit.",中国对长征五号乙运载火箭的核心助推器受到的批评大为不满。其中一枚在2020年的试飞中坠落在西非，造成了损失，但到目前为止，尚无任何一级火箭造成人员伤亡。在2023年，至少还有一次火箭发射计划，届时将把巡天号太空望远镜将进入轨道。
"Chinese officials say they don't just want to avoid uncontrolled re-entry, but to reuse rockets.",中国官员表示，他们不仅要避免不受控制的火箭返回，还要重复使用火箭。
"""We will take reuse as an important technical goal of our projects reuse will bring technical challenges, but it will bring better economics and will also enable better development of the aerospace industry,"" Mr. Zhou said","""我们都会将重复使用作为我们工程的一个重要的技术目标。重复使用会带来技术上的挑战，但是它会带来更好的经济性，也会带来航天产业的一个更好的发展，""周建平说"
"Rong Yi, chief designer of the Long March 2F carrier rocket that took the Shenzhou 15 mission into space, said that on Nov. 26, China had tested a prototype for a reusable rocket booster that burned liquid oxygen and kerosene. Even before then, she said, China had been working hard on steering technologies to make sure that a reusable rocket would land in a specific location.",将神舟十五号任务送入太空的长征二号F运载火箭总设计师容易表示，11月26日，中国测试了一种烧液氧煤油的可重复使用火箭助推器原型。她说，甚至在此之前，中国就一直在努力研发转向技术，以确保可重复使用的火箭能够降落在特定位置。
"Additionally, He Yu, chief commander of crewed spaceship systems at the China Academy of Space Technology, said that, in May 2020, China had already tested a reusable prototype for a spaceship capsule.",此外，中国空间技术研究院载人飞船系统总指挥何宇表示，2020年5月，中国已经测试了可重复使用的飞船舱原型。
The effort to develop reusable spacecraft is running parallel to Chinese officials' plans to put astronauts on the moon. They have not announced a precise timetable but have previously hinted that it would not happen later than 2030.,可重复使用航天器的开发工作与中国官方将宇航员送上月球的计划同步进行。他们尚未公布确切的时间表，但此前曾暗示不会晚于2030年。
Mr. Ji and Mr. Zhou each said that considerable work had already been done on a crewed lunar lander.,季启明和周建平均表示，在载人登月器方面已经做了大量工作。
"""These works have laid a solid foundation for the manned lunar exploration project,"" Mr. Ji said during a news conference at the Jiuquan launch center, before making an allusion to Chinese mythology: ""I believe the dream of Chinese people to embrace the moon from the ninth heaven will come true in the near future.""","""这些工作为载人月球探测工程奠定了坚实的基础，""季启明在酒泉发射中心的新闻发布会上说，然后他引用了中国神话:""我相信中国人九天揽月的梦想将在不远将来成为现实。"""
"But sending a person to the moon has been done. Sending a person to Mars is an even bigger prize for China. It has placed an emphasis on shortening the duration of such a trip, perhaps with nuclear propulsion instead of conventional rocket engines. Officials are also determined that any journey will be a round-trip from which all astronauts return alive and in good health.",但是载人登月已经有人做到了。把人送上火星对中国来说是一个更大的奖赏。它着重于缩短飞行时间，也许会使用核推进而不是传统的火箭发动机。官员们还确定，每次任务都将是往返飞行，所有宇航员都将活着并健康地返回。
"""Technically, it is feasible in theory, but it has huge challenges in engineering because the scale is very large, we have estimated at least 900 days of travel"" based on current technologies, Mr. Zhou said.","""技术上从理论上讲都可行，但是它工程上有巨大的挑战，因为规模非常大，我们估算过至少900多天的旅程行程，""周建平说。"
"With nuclear propulsion, the trip could be trimmed to 500 days, he said, without predicting whether China would adopt that approach.",他说，有了核动力，行程可以缩短到500天，但没有预测中国是否会采用这种方法。
"Huang Weifen, chief designer of China's astronaut program, said she was looking at ways to make sure that astronauts could stay healthy for a 500-day trip.",中国航天员计划总设计师黄伟芬表示，她正在寻找方法确保航天员在500天的旅程中保持健康。
"""It is another qualitative leap in flying a very big challenge for people in terms of the medical issues, the psychological issues and living guarantees,"" she said.","""它又是一个质的飞跃，对人来讲非常大的一个挑战，就是医学方面的问题，心理方面的问题，""她说。"
"Despite all these difficulties, China is intent on sticking to its long-term plan for space.",尽管存在所有这些困难，中国仍决心坚持其长期的太空计划。
"""Landing on the moon, landing on Mars, are very significant progress in the development of human civilization,"" Mr. Zhou said. ""We may understand and realize its further value step by step. But its role in the development of our human civilization is huge, so it is worth our efforts it's worth fighting for.""","""我认为登陆火星登陆月球也好，登陆火星也好，它是人类文明发展的一个非常重大的进步，""周建平说。""当然说它进一步的作用，我们可能还要一步步地看，一步步地才能去认识它，才能兑现它，但是它本身对于我们人类文明的发展的作用是巨大的，所以值得我们去努力，值得我们去奋斗。"""
"Restaurants have closed because too many staff members have tested positive for Covid. The usually ubiquitous food delivery workers zipping through traffic on their scooters have nearly vanished because of infections. Pharmacies have been emptied of cold medicine, and supermarkets have been running low on the essentials: disinfectant solution, antibacterial wipes, beer.",由于太多的员工核酸阳性，餐馆已经关门。以前街头随处可见的骑着小摩托车在车流中穿梭的外卖送餐员已几乎消失，因为他们中很多人感染了新冠病毒。药店的感冒药被抢购一空，超市的必需品也告罄:消毒液、抗菌湿巾、啤酒。
"Less than a week after the Chinese government lifted its stringent ""zero Covid"" restrictions, Beijing looks like a city in the throes of a lockdown this time, self-imposed by residents. Sidewalks and pedestrian shopping streets are barren, and once busy traffic thoroughfares are deserted. Residents are hunkering down indoors and hoarding medicine as a wave of Covid sweeps across the Chinese capital.","中国政府取消了严格的""新冠清零""政策后不到一周，北京看起来像是一座处于封控困境下的城市，只不过这次是民众自己强加的。人行道和步行购物街人迹稀少，曾经繁忙的交通要道现在变得空空荡荡。随着一轮新冠疫情席卷中国首都，民众都躲在家中并囤积药物。"
"""No one dares to come out now,"" said Yue Jiajun, a Beijing restaurant owner, who initially celebrated when customers were allowed to dine indoors last week only to learn later that the surge in infections would keep them away.","""现在放开没人敢出来，没有人，""北京一家餐馆的老板岳家军(音)说，政府上周允许顾客堂食后，一开始他还挺高兴的，后来才发现感染激增会让顾客不敢来吃饭。"
"""Even takeaway, I have no customers,"" said Mr. Yue, who admitted that there probably weren't enough delivery drivers for his orders anyway.","""外卖一样，也没有客人，""岳先生说，不过他承认，就算有人下单，可能也没有足够的外卖送餐员。"
"All over the city, residents were gripped by the sinking realization that a virus most of the world had already experienced was spreading freely and rapidly for the first time, three years after it emerged. Weibo, China's popular social media service, was awash with people around the country sharing news of their infections and their personal experiences with Covid.",整座城市的居民都有一种不祥的意识，那就是，世界上大部分地区已经历过的病毒在出现了三年后，正首次在北京不受限制地、迅速地传播。受欢迎的社交媒体平台——微博充满了全国各地的人们分享感染新冠病毒的消息和患病经历。
"""Fifty to 60 percent of my relatives and friends have tested positive,"" wrote one person on Weibo, a social media site.","""目前亲戚朋友里的阳性大概增加到了50%到60%，""一名网友在微博上写道。"
"Liu Qiangdong, the chief executive of the e-commerce site JD.com, and Wang Shi, a real estate tycoon, shared on Weibo their experiences about recovering from Covid. A virus-stricken Zhang Lan, the founder of a popular restaurant chain, South Beauty Group, summoned the energy to hawk vitamin supplements and sausage as potential remedies on a livestream.",电子商务网站京东的首席执行官刘强东和房地产大亨王石都在微博上分享了他们感染新冠病毒后康复的经历。人气连锁餐厅俏江南集团的创始人张兰也感染了病毒，尽管状态不佳，她仍在网上直播带货，推销维生素和香肠作为治病补充措施。
"""I'm here to encourage you,"" Ms. Zhang told her viewers. ""Adjust your mentality, drink plenty of water. You'll be fine.""","""我在这里就是鼓励你，""张兰告诉她的观众。""调整好心态，多喝水，没事。"""
"Medicine has become hard to find, either at hospital clinics or at pharmacies. Many residents complain that the city should have done more to anticipate the Covid outbreak and to stockpile drugs ahead of time.",药物已变得很难找到，无论是在医院还是在药店。许多居民抱怨，北京应该对预料之中的疫情暴发有更多的准备，应该提前储备药物。
"""The most urgent issue is the shortage of medicine,"" said a 25-year-old Beijing resident who gave only his family name, Wang, given the political sensitivity of the issue.","""最紧缺的是没有药，""一名现年25岁的北京居民说，由于讨论疫情问题的政治敏感性，他只说自己姓王。"
Mr. Wang said that he developed a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and a sore throat on Saturday morning and became dizzy. He tested positive for coronavirus on a rapid antigen test at home and went to a fever clinic at a hospital.,王先生说，他周六早上发烧37.8度，喉咙痛，头晕。他在家中做了快速抗原检测，阳性后去了一家医院的发热门诊。
"""I don't know if I'm doing it right at home, so I came to the hospital to find out if there are any precautions,"" Mr. Wang said, adding that he tried to obtain ibuprofen, a painkiller, and a popular herbal remedy called Lianhua Qingwen that has been the subject of price gouging.","""在家不知道做得对不对，来医院了解有没有什么注意事项，""王先生说，还说他想让医生给他开止痛药布洛芬和一种名为连花清瘟的抢手中成药，后者的价格已遭到哄抬。"
"The doctor instead prescribed loxoprofen, a different painkiller, and Ganmao Qingre granules, a less coveted herbal remedy. ""Many medicines in great demand are not available now, and I don't know if other medicines prescribed can have the same effect,"" Mr. Wang said.","医生给他开了另一种止痛药洛索洛芬和一种人气没有那么高的中成药——感冒清热冲剂。""因为现在很多药没有，开的其他药不知道能不能有大效果，热门的药基本卖光了，""王先生说。"
Vincent Chen said he resorted to begging friends outside Beijing to send him fever medication after he couldn't find any at his local pharmacies or online. He had to splurge on an express delivery company because ordinary services were either too busy or didn't have enough staff.,文森特·陈(音)说，他在本地药店或网上都找不到退烧药，后来求他在北京以外的朋友把退烧药寄来。他不得不为此花了一大笔钱快递费，因为普通投递服务忙不过来或人手不够。
"""Couriers are paralyzed,"" said Mr. Chen, 35.","""其他快递也瘫痪了，""现年35岁的陈先生说。"
Others have caught on. Tutorials are now spreading on Weibo teaching city dwellers how to purchase drugs from pharmacies in the countryside.,人们各有奇招。微博上现在流传着教城市居民如何从农村药店买药的攻略。
"The hoarding of remedies isn't limited to cough medicine and lozenges. Stores are now running out of jarred peaches because they're believed to be packed with enough nutrients to ward off the virus. The sweet snack is popular in northeastern China for treating cold symptoms, but it now appears to be winning converts elsewhere as people try to gain an edge on the illness. State media has had to weigh in, declaring there's no proof peaches make a difference.",囤积的药品不仅限于止咳药和润喉糖。商店里的黄桃罐头现已售罄，因为据信它们富含足以抵御病毒的营养。这种甜品在中国东北地区颇受欢迎，当地人用它来缓解感冒症状，但现在随着人们想方设法战胜新冠病毒，黄桃罐头似乎正在其他地方赢得信徒。官方媒体不得不出面澄清，称没有证据表明黄桃罐头有任何药效作用。
"It wasn't the only time in the last week the government has had to step in to try to calm a frenzy over an elixir. The State Administration for Market Regulation, a market watchdog, warned producers and retailers about runaway prices after Lianhua Qingwen, the herbal remedy, started selling at more than triple its regular price.","这不是政府上周唯一一次试图平息人们寻找""神药""的狂热。国家市场监督管理总局已就中成药价格失控问题向生产商和零售商发出警告，这之前已出现了以高于正常价格三倍多的价格出售连花清瘟的情况。"
"""It is strictly forbidden to drive up prices,"" the regulator said on Friday.","""严禁哄抬物价，""国家市监局上周五通报说。"
"Shares of Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical, the maker of Lianhua Qingwen, have jumped more than 20 percent on the Shenzhen stock market since Covid restrictions were relaxed.",自从政府放松新冠病毒防控措施以来，连花清瘟的制造商石家庄以岭药业的股票已在深圳股市上涨了逾20%。
"The shortages don't appear to have extended to food. Beijing has repeatedly promised that groceries would remain adequate through the pandemic. The capital, given its political importance, has traditionally had priority for food supplies.",短缺问题似乎没有扩大到食物。北京已一再承诺保持在疫情期间生活必需品供应充足。鉴于首都的政治重要性，北京历来在食物供应上享有优先权。
"Large piles of oranges, corn, cabbage and other produce were still available at supermarkets in the city that were able to round up enough staff to remain open. The only sections with dwindling inventory were for cleaning products and booze as customers tried to hedge how much time they'd need to stay indoors.",在北京仍有足够员工维持营业的超市里，橙子、玉米、卷心菜和其他农产品供应充足。只是清洁产品和酒类的货架正在变空，因为顾客们试图为他们需要在室内待多久做准备。
Other businesses aren't so fortunate as grocery stores. China tried to revitalize its travel industry last week by ending the many restrictions on travel between provinces. But some Beijing hotels have stopped admitting new guests because they have too few staff to look after them.,其他生意就没有超市那么幸运了。中国为试图重振旅游业已在上周取消了对国内旅行的限制，但北京的一些酒店已不再接收新客人，因为酒店的员工太少，无法为客人提供服务。
"The severity of Beijing's outbreak is hard to discern. China's mass testing system is being dismantled, so the number of infections is unknown. The city recorded 559 confirmed cases and 468 asymptomatic infections on Monday. That's down from 1,163 confirmed cases and 3,503 asymptomatic infections on Dec. 5, the last day authorities required a negative test to enter public spaces.",北京疫情的严重程度难以判断。中国正在拆除国内的大规模核酸检测系统，因此无法知道感染人数。北京市周一通报了559例确诊病例和468例无症状感染者，低于12月5日通报的1163例确诊病例和3503例无症状感染者。12月5日是当局要求进入公共场所需出示核酸检测阴性证明的最后一天。
"Other available data suggests a city experiencing a surge in cases. Li Ang, a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, said at a news conference on Monday that the number of calls for emergency services on Friday was six times higher than normal and that visits to fever clinics had increased 16-fold in a week.",其他可得到的数据表明，北京的感染人数激增。北京市卫健委新闻发言人李昂在周一的新闻发布会上说，120急救电话呼入量急剧增加，上周五的呼入量是平时的六倍，全市发热门诊上周的就诊人次是一周前的16倍。
"One of the biggest questions is whether China can maintain medical care for people who fall seriously ill with Covid or who have unrelated conditions requiring treatment. Beijing, with some of the country's best hospitals, has an advantage over rural areas. The city appealed on Saturday for people not to call the medical emergency hotline if they were asymptomatic or had only mild cases.",一个最大的问题是，中国能否为感染新冠病毒的重症患者或患有其他不相关疾病的人提供所需的救治和医疗服务。北京与农村地区相比有很多优势，拥有国内一些最好的医院。北京上周六呼吁人们如果无症状或轻症，不要拨打120急救电话。
"Several older people leaving a hospital in the Dongcheng district on Saturday said in separate interviews that they had received treatment, including for kidney dialysis and an injured foot.",记者上周六先后采访了离开东城区一家医院的几位老人，他们表示得到了治疗，包括透析和脚伤。
"But a 66-year-old man, complaining about a week of chronic pain at the base of his back, said that he had been turned away because the emergency room was full. The man, who gave only his family name, Gao, given the political sensitivity in discussing China's pandemic response, said that he would try again later.",但是一名66岁的男子抱怨说，他患有慢性腰痛，已经疼了一周，他说没能看成急诊，因为号都挂完了。由于讨论中国应对新冠病毒大流行做法的政治敏感性，这名男子只说自己姓高，他说，他来日会再试着挂一次号。
"""I am still in pain,"" he said. ""I will come again.""","""我现在还是疼，""他说。""我会再来。"""
"Mandy Liu, a 21-year-old university student in Beijing, believes that anyone who has lived in China during the pandemic can see that the country's future is looking increasingly uncertain.",在21岁的北京大学生曼迪·刘看来，但凡疫情期间生活在中国的人都能看出来这个国家的未来看起来越来越不确定。

She has not received a single offer.",疫情的防控措施令人窒息，就业形势严峻。她将于明年毕业，届时将获得旅游管理学位，并且提交了80多份工作申请。目前她尚未接到一份录用通知。
"Many young people had followed what the Chinese Communist Party told them to do, only to be left disillusioned, Ms. Liu said. ""What we are seeing is that people are struggling to survive.""","刘女士说，许多年轻人听中国共产党的话，结果却大失所望。""我们所看到的是民不聊生。"""
"That discontent bubbled over in recent weeks as throngs of students, job seekers and young professionals stormed the streets in major cities across China to protest the government's iron-fisted Covid rules. The unrest brought into view the party's longstanding concern that a shortage of jobs and economic opportunities for young people posed a threat to social stability.",最近几周，这种不满情绪不断涌现，在中国许多大城市，有大批学生、求职者和年轻专业人士冲上街道，抗议政府的铁腕防疫手段。这场动乱凸显了该党长期以来的担忧，即年轻人缺乏就业机会和经济机会将威胁到社会稳定。
"On Wednesday, Beijing caved to the protesters' demands and relaxed many of its ""zero Covid"" restrictions. But the bigger and more vexing problem remains: An ugly job market with too many applicants jostling for too few jobs could mean that China's decades of economic prosperity may soon be out of reach for many young people.","周三，北京屈服于抗议者的要求，放宽了许多""清零""限制。但更大、更令人头疼的问题依然存在:恶劣的就业形势，求职者太多而工作机会太少，这可能意味着中国几十年的经济繁荣很快对许多年轻人来说可能就会变得遥不可及。"
"Youth unemployment is still close to the highest levels on record, with another 11.6 million college graduates preparing to join the work force next year. ""The students want to protest, because we do feel that our situation is getting worse,"" said Ms. Liu, who did not participate in the recent protests.","青年失业率依然接近历史最高水平，明年将有1160万大学毕业生加入劳动力大军。""因为学生想抗议，我们确实感受到了我们的环境，有在变差，""刘女士说(她没有参加最近的抗议活动)。"
"Covid restrictions drained momentum from an economy already reeling from a collapse in the property market. A government crackdown on fast-growing industries such as technology and private education has sapped opportunities in the private sector, intensifying competition for civil servant jobs and admission into graduate schools.",新冠的限制措施耗尽了经济的动力，而经济已经因房地产市场崩溃而步履蹒跚。政府打压科技和民办教育等快速发展的行业，削弱了民营部门的机会，加剧了考公和考研的竞争。
"The narrowing prospects have betrayed the expectations of a generation of young people raised in relative prosperity as beneficiaries of an ascendant economy that provided steady employment and rising incomes for their parents. Students were told that by studying hard, they, too, could enjoy a better life.",不断收窄的前景辜负了这一代在相对富裕的环境中长大的年轻人，崛起的经济为他们的父母提供了稳定的就业机会和不断增加的收入，使他们因之受益。学生们接受的教导是，只要努力学习，他们也可以享受更好的生活。
"""The promise was if you educate yourself, you will get a good-paying job. That is no longer materializing,"" said Max Zenglein, chief economist at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. ""To be the first generation that is going to be disappointed, that creates a lot of emotional pressure.""","""这个承诺是如果你接受教育，你就会得到一份高薪工作。这不再现实，""柏林墨卡托中国研究所首席经济学家曾林(Max Zenglein)说。""他们成为第一代将要感到失望的人，这会产生很大的情绪压力。"""
"When Xi Jinping, China's leader, addressed the Communist Party congress in 2017, he declared that ""a nation will prosper only when its young people thrive."" He repeated the mantra again in October before the start of a precedent-defying third term, adding that China's youths were ""filled with greater optimism and enterprise.""","中国领导人习近平在2017年的共产党代表大会上的讲话中宣称，""少年强则国强。""在打破先例的第三个任期开始前，他在10月再次重复了这句口号，并补充说，中国的""青年一代更加积极向上""。"
"But the words rang hollow. Frustration was building with a growing number of youths out of work and the draconian Covid restrictions limiting the opportunities for young people to work, travel and socialize.",但是这些话听起来很空洞。越来越多的年轻人失业，严厉的新冠措施限制了年轻人工作、旅行和社交的机会，大家的挫败感越来越大。
"In July, the jobless rate for people between the ages of 16 and 24 reached nearly 20 percent the highest level since China started announcing the figure in 2018. The rate has ticked down, but it is still triple the national average.",7月，16至24岁人群的失业率达到近20%，这是自2018年中国开始公布这一数字以来的最高水平。这一数字已有所下降，但仍是全民平均水平的三倍。
"The graduates who have secured jobs are paid less. The average monthly salary for 2022 college graduates who found a job was 12 percent less than what 2021 graduates received, according to a survey by the Chinese job site Zhaopin.",找到工作的毕业生工资较低。中国求职网站智联招聘的一项调查显示，2022年找到工作的大学毕业生的平均月薪比2021年毕业生低12%。
"The lack of postgraduation options has gotten so bad that when one prominent entrepreneur advised students to take a ""gap year"" to travel within China, the video went viral and came under heavy criticism for being out of touch with the challenges facing young people in the country.","毕业后的选择十分匮乏，以至于当一位著名企业家建议学生花""间隔年""在国内旅行时，这段视频被广泛传播并受到严厉批评，因为它与中国年轻人面临的挑战脱节。"
"With fewer private sector jobs, young people are being forced to seek alternatives that were considered less appealing during boom times. There has been a record number of applicants for graduate schools, national teaching positions and civil service jobs.",随着民营部门工作岗位的减少，年轻人被迫寻找在繁荣时期不怎么有吸引力的替代方案。考研、考教职和考公务员的人数创历史新高。
"Last month, China delayed the national Civil Service exam amid a rise in Covid infections. Civil Service jobs are considered some of the most stable in the country, with the exam tracing back more than 1,400 years. Alice Li, 23, is preparing to take the exam when it is rescheduled. She will be among 2.6 million applications fighting for 37,100 jobs about 70 applicants for every spot.",上个月，由于感染数的增加，中国推迟了国家公务员考试。公务员职位被认为是该国最稳定的职位之一，这种性质的考试历史可以追溯到1400多年前。23岁的爱丽丝·李正准备参加重新安排的考试。她将成为260万名竞争者当中的一员，争夺37100个职位——每个职位大约有70名申请者。
"The growing demand for government jobs is a testament to how Mr. Xi has reshaped China with an expanded role for the state, forcing businesses to take a back seat to the needs of the Communist Party.",越来越多人申请政府职位证明了习近平如何通过扩大国家的作用来重塑中国，迫使企业让位于共产党的需求。
"Ms. Li was working at a technology start-up in Shanghai this year when, at the height of the city's Covid outbreak, her boss informed her that the company was laying off 30 percent of its staff, including her. After losing her marketing job, she started to prepare for the Civil Service exam an option that she never considered until she felt the sting of losing her job.",今年，在上海疫情最严重的时候，李女士正在该市一家科技初创公司工作，老板通知她，该公司将裁员30%，其中就包括她。失去营销工作后，她开始准备公务员考试——她过去从未考虑过这个选择，直到感受到失去工作的痛楚。
"""It's hard enough for us to find a proper job, and harder for us to stay,"" Ms. Li said. ""I have to believe that the public sectors would be the last ones to fall during the economic crisis.""","""我们找一份合适的工作已经够难了，保住工作就更难了，""李女士说。""我不得不相信，公共部门将是经济危机期间最后倒下的部门。"""
"China's labor market has struggled to keep pace with the country's influx of university students. In the last two decades, the number of college graduates in China has increased sevenfold.",中国的劳动力市场一直难以跟上大学生涌入的步伐。在过去的二十年里，中国的大学毕业生人数增加了七倍。
"While the number of college graduates has continued to grow an 8 percent increase set for 2023 the pandemic has also robbed students of formative social experiences during university life, adding to their frustration and anxiety.",虽然大学毕业生人数持续增长——2023年将增长8%——但疫情也剥夺了学生在大学生活中形成社会经验的机会，增加了他们的沮丧和焦虑。
"Iris Feng, a senior at a university in Beijing, said her college life had been dominated by Covid restrictions. Before the protests, she said, her school erected a fence this year to restrict students from going to or leaving campus. Then it added a second layer of fencing, and officials installed an alarm that would go off if people got too close. Students needed to make appointments to go onto a field on campus or head to the laboratory to study. Cafeteria chairs were removed because students were no longer allowed to eat there.",北京一所大学的大四学生伊丽丝·冯说，她的大学生活一直被新冠限制措施左右。她说，在抗议活动发生之前，她所在的学校今年竖起了围栏，限制学生进出校园。然后又增加了第二层围栏，官员们安装了一个警报器，如果有人靠得太近就会响起。学生需要预约才能进入校园的操场或前往实验室学习。食堂的椅子移走了，学生不许在里面用餐。
"""University was equivalent to living a dull, dull life. I think this sacrifice was unnecessary,"" said Ms. Feng, who had not returned to her hometown in two years because she feared she wouldn't be admitted back onto campus.","""大学就等于过着枯燥乏味的生活。我认为这种牺牲是不必要的，""冯女士说，她已经两年没有回老家了，因为她担心自己无法再回到学校。"
"When the protests broke out, some universities allowed students to return home after months of being locked down and provided shuttle buses to ferry students to train stations and airports. Some questioned whether the move was a concession to student protesters or a tactic to disperse them and prevent them from organizing future demonstrations.",抗议活动爆发后，一些大学允许学生在被封锁数月后返乡，并提供接驳巴士将学生送往火车站和机场。一些人质疑此举到底是对学生抗议者做出的让步，还是一种驱散他们的策略，以防他们继续组织示威活动。
"As part of China's announcement to ease pandemic measures this week, Beijing said schools must hold in-person classes and open libraries, cafeterias and other facilities if there were no outbreaks on campus. But as graduation nears next summer, the question of what awaits these students when they enter the job market is becoming more urgent.",作为本周宣布的放松防控措施的一部分，北京表示，如果校园没有疫情，学校必须进行线下授课，并开放图书馆、食堂和其他设施。但是，随着明年夏天毕业季的临近，这些学生将进入就业市场，他们届时将面临什么样的情况，这个问题变得更加紧迫。
"Elsa Han, 21, wants to work for a tech company after graduation because she does not like the stuffy office culture of state-owned enterprises or government jobs. Ideally, she said, she would like a full-time role with the large internet conglomerate where she is interning. She knows the chances are slim because she expects more than 100 interns to apply for the one open position she is eyeing there.",21岁的艾尔莎·韩希望毕业后去一家科技公司工作，因为她不喜欢国有企业或政府部门古板的办公室文化。她说，理想情况下，她希望在她目前实习的大型互联网集团拿到全职职位。她知道机会很渺茫，因为她预计，自己看中的一个空缺职位将有100多名实习生申请。
"If she can't find a job, Ms. Han said, she hopes to travel abroad and leave China. ""In the current environment in China,"" she said, ""I don't think I'm living a happy life.""","韩女士说，如果找不到工作，她希望前往国外，离开中国。""现在在中国的大的环境下，""她说，""我觉得我并不是生活得很开心。"""
The Chinese government is on a mission: to convince older citizens that its latest Covid-19 vaccines are easy to take and effective.,中国政府正在执行一项任务:让老年人相信最新的国产新冠疫苗接种起来容易，而且有效。
"In state-run media, a woman at a clinic in Tianjin said ""there was no discomfort"" with a new inhaled vaccine, while a woman in Shanghai quipped that getting her booster was ""a bit like drinking milk tea."" A man in Wenzhou reassured the hesitant, ""it doesn't hurt at all, and it's a little sweet.""","官媒上，天津一名女子在接种点接种了新的吸入式疫苗后称""没有任何不适""，上海一名女子接种了加强剂后打趣地说""有点像喝奶茶""。温州一名男子说""一点都不疼，还有点甜""，以打消犹豫不决者的疑虑。"
"Such state-sponsored messaging is critical as the Chinese government drops its onerous Covid restrictions and braces for a surge in cases that could overwhelm its medical resources. It not only needs to convince people that the virus is nothing to fear, but also that vaccines are essential to protect against the most severe outcomes of the disease. The outbreaks in the coming weeks and months and how deadly they will be depend in part on whether older adults are willing to be inoculated.","随着中国政府放弃繁苛的""新冠清零""政策，准备应对可能造成医疗资源挤兑的感染人数激增，这种官方推动的信息传递至关重要。政府不仅需要让人们相信新冠病毒并不可怕，还要让人们相信疫苗对于预防这种疾病的最严重后果至关重要。中国未来几周和几个月的疫情——以及疫情将导致多少人死亡——部分取决于老年人的疫苗接种意愿。"
"Since its dramatic about-face to dismantle its ""zero Covid"" strategy last week, China has been downplaying the severity of the Omicron variant rippling through cities, essentially encouraging the country to learn to live with Covid. A top epidemiologist noted on Sunday that the death rate is similar to the common flu. Another health expert said authorities were prepared for the strain on the country's medical system.","自从政府上周急转弯，突然取消了""新冠清零""政策以来，中国一直在淡化目前在多个城市传播的奥密克戎变异株的严重性，基本上是在鼓励国人学会与新冠病毒疾病共处。一位知名流行病学家周日指出，奥密克戎的致死率与普通流感的类似。另一位卫生专家则说，当局已准备好应对国内医疗系统将面临的压力。"
"On Monday, China reported 8,561 new local cases, compared to around 30,000 before the strategy shifted. The figures have become increasingly unreliable as officials have all but stopped regular mass testing in recent days and made reporting of home testing voluntary.",中国周一通报了8561例新增本土感染病例，而这个数字在政策大转弯前是3万例左右。由于官员们已在最近几天几乎停止了常规的大规模核酸检测，让使用快速抗原自检的人自愿报告阳性结果，政府宣布的感染数字已变得越来越不可靠。
"Uncertainties over the new approach, and the rushed rollback of the rules, are mounting.",新的防疫做法和仓促放松所带来的不确定性正在增加。
"Within China's oldest segment of the population, 40 percent have not received a booster; the World Health Organization has said such doses are especially vital with Chinese vaccines, which use inactivated virus and are usually less effective than foreign counterparts that use newer mRNA technology. And many families are still hesitant about the safety of vaccines for their elder relatives, even as new inhalable vaccines are being portrayed as less scary than those that require a needle.",中国年龄最大的人口当中仍有40%未接种加强针;世界卫生组织说，接种加强针对中国国产疫苗尤为重要，因为国产疫苗使用的是灭活病毒，效力通常不如使用更新的mRNA技术的外国疫苗。许多家庭仍对老年亲属接种疫苗的安全性犹豫不决，尽管新的吸入式疫苗被描述为不像需要打针的疫苗那么吓人。
"Health experts warn that the vaccination campaign may be too late to defend against the current wave of cases. Singapore, where officials lifted strict measures late last year, spent months communicating and preparing before easing measures.",卫生专家警告，疫苗接种运动对预防当前这轮感染浪潮来说可能为时已晚。去年底取消严格防控措施之前，新加坡的官员们花了好几个月的时间与民众沟通，为放宽防疫措施做准备。
"The authorities in Hong Kong neglected to encourage its older population to get vaccinated until it was in the middle of a major outbreak earlier this year. Without a high level of inoculation at the time, the virus killed people at a rate that exceeded nearly every country since the start of the pandemic.",香港当局起初没有重视对老年人接种疫苗的鼓励，直到今年早些时候陷入一轮重大疫情中后才采取相关行动。由于当时老年人的疫苗接种率不够高，香港那轮新冠疫情的病死率超过了自大流行开始以来的几乎所有国家和地区。
"""Ideally, you would be prepared before you open the gates,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""This is really not a recipe for a smooth transition it's going to be a bumpy ride.""","""理想情况下，你会在打开大门之前做好准备，""美国外交关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠说。""目前的做法真不是平稳过渡的秘诀——前面的道路将充满颠簸。"""
"As China's authoritarian government faced angry and rare protests against its Covid restrictions, policymakers two weeks ago launched a new vaccination drive targeting older citizens, a tacit recognition that in order to ease the rules, they needed to do more to protect the most vulnerable.",由于发生了针对中国威权主义政府新冠清零政策罕见、愤怒的抗议活动，决策者们曾在两周前开始了加强针对老年人的新一轮疫苗接种运动，这等于是在默认，为了放松管控，政府需要采取更多措施保护最易感的人群。
"Officials pledged to bring vaccines to nursing homes, go door-to-door and use mobile stations. They swiftly rolled out one newly approved inhaled vaccine, touting it in a steady stream of television reports, newspaper articles and local health fact sheets as ""easy,"" ""convenient,"" and ""like breathing fresh air.""","官员们承诺的措施包括将疫苗送进养老院，挨家挨户上门接种，使用移动接种点。政府迅速推出了一种新批准的吸入式疫苗，并接二连三地出现在电视报道、报纸文章以及各地发放的防疫指南中，标榜这种疫苗的使用""简单、方便""，""感觉像吸了一口新鲜的空气""。"
Officials have to overcome a deeply ingrained skepticism that they helped instill.,官员们不得不克服他们帮助老年人形成的对疫苗根深蒂固的怀疑态度。
"In early 2021, when China introduced its domestic vaccine, regulators restricted use to people between the ages of 18 to 59, inadvertently fueling misinformation and hesitancy within one of the most vulnerable segments of the population.",中国2021年初推出国产疫苗时，监管机构曾把疫苗的使用限制在18至59岁的人群，无意中在一个最易感人群中助长了对疫苗的错误信息和犹豫。
"""That led to a firestorm of people saying it's not safe for the elderly,"" said Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. ""They are quite keen to avoid that narrative right now.""","""这在人群中引发了一个爆炸性说法，认为疫苗对老年人不安全，""香港大学病毒学家薛达(Siddharth Sridhar)说。""他们现在非常想改变这种说法。"""
"Many families urged their older relatives to stay home, thinking the inoculations might complicate chronic health conditions. Temporary vaccination clinics were reluctant to give older people a shot, since the facilities didn't have their health records on hand. Neighborhood health workers and family members alike asked whether it was worth risking potential side effects when cases were essentially nonexistent in many cities.",许多家庭曾劝阻家里的老年人不去接种，认为接种疫苗可能会使他们的慢性病恶化。临时设立的疫苗接种点也不愿意给老年人打疫苗，因为这些诊所无法看到老年人的病历。社区卫生工作者和家庭成员都在问，在许多城市基本上不存在新冠病毒感染病例的情况下，冒着可能出现副作用的风险接种疫苗是否值得。
"Nicolas Tian, 24, urged his grandparents not to get vaccinated, citing concern over authorities restricting the doses to younger populations.",现年24岁的尼古拉斯·田(音)曾劝阻爷爷奶奶不要接种疫苗，理由是当局将疫苗的使用限制在青年和成年人口是对疫苗有所担心。
"""In the beginning, people generally thought that people older than 60 years old were not suitable candidates for vaccination,"" said Mr. Tian, who lives in the northeastern province of Shandong. He got vaccinated, but only because his government job required it.","""一开始，我们普遍认为六十岁以上不适合接种新冠疫苗，""家住山东省的田先生说。他接种了疫苗，但那是因为他在政府工作，必须接种。"
"Many public-sector workers were among the first groups to get vaccinated at a time when doses were still limited. While his employer called it a perk, Mr. Tian wasn't convinced.",在疫苗供应仍有限的时候，许多在政府部门工作的人属于第一批接种群体。虽然他的工作单位称接种疫苗是福利，但田先生并不相信。
"""We all knew it was treating us like lab rats, or at least I personally took it that way,"" he said.","""我们都知道这就是把我们当小白鼠，至少我自己是这么觉得的，""他说。"
"When his workplace later recommended that each employee find five people to get inoculated, he felt authorities had changed the requirements in a rush to boost the vaccination rate. He strongly discouraged family members from getting the shot.",后来他的工作单位建议每个员工找五名愿意接种疫苗的人时，他觉得当局是在匆忙改变要求，以提高疫苗接种率。他强烈劝阻家人不要打疫苗。
"""Although authorities said there was no harm in getting vaccinated, the popular thinking was that, 'it is better not to have elderly people vaccinated.'""","""虽然政府说接种疫苗没有伤害，但大家口耳相传的都是'最好别让老人家打疫苗。'"""
"Since approving Chinese vaccines, officials have provided little information other than to assure the public that they are safe.",自从中国批准了国产疫苗以来，官员们除了向公众保证疫苗安全外，几乎没有提供过任何信息。
"Authorities have recently approved six domestic vaccines, four of them in the past week. Two of the vaccines do not require a needle and are instead administered through a nasal spray or inhaled through a nebulizer, technology considered the frontier for the future prevention of Covid.",当局最近批准了六种国产疫苗，其中四种是在过去一周批准的。其中有两种不需要打针，而是通过鼻喷或雾化器吸入，这种技术被认为是未来预防新冠病毒疾病的前沿技术。
"Health experts and doctors quoted in state media have embraced the inhaled vaccines, saying they are effective, safe and suitable for older populations, without providing detailed data.",官方媒体援引健康专家和医生的话说，他们接受吸入式疫苗，称其安全有效、适合老年人使用，但没有提供详细数据。
"""The most obvious advantage of inhaled vaccine is that it reduces the fear of injection,"" Zhang Xin, a medical worker, said in the state-run news outlet Xinhua of Convidecia Air, a Covid vaccine developed by CanSino Biologics that was approved in September.","""吸入式新冠疫苗，它的最明显的一个好处就是减轻了大家对于针剂疫苗的恐惧，""官媒新华社报道医务工作者张鑫对克威莎雾优的看法时说，克威莎雾优是由康希诺生物研发的新冠疫苗，于今年9月获批。"
"Scientists hope that by inducing an immune response in the nasal cavities and the lungs, an inhaled vaccine could offer significant protection, particularly against transmission. In reality, little is known about the real-world effectiveness of the new inhaled vaccines, which are being studied around the world but have not been broadly put to the test.",科学家们希望吸入式疫苗能通过在鼻腔和肺诱发免疫响应，提供相当程度的保护，尤其是针对感染的保护。实际上，人们对新型吸入式疫苗在现实世界中的效力知之甚少，虽然世界各地都在研究这种疫苗，但还没有对其进行广泛的临床试验。
"Early studies point to their potential power in fighting off severe illness. A nasal spray developed by Hong Kong University, together with Xiamen University and Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy, has proved in phase III trials to be 80 percent effective against Omicron as a booster following two doses of inactivated vaccines and 55 percent effective in unvaccinated people.",早期的研究提到吸入式疫苗在防止重症上有潜在作用。对香港大学与厦门大学和北京万泰生物药业共同研发的鼻腔喷雾剂的三期临床试验表明，接种了两剂灭活疫苗后将鼻喷疫苗作为加强剂使用，对抵抗奥密克戎感染有80%的效力;未接种疫苗者使用鼻喷疫苗，对抵抗奥密克戎感染有55%的效力。
"Even without complete information, the prospect of a coming tsunami of cases has been enough to prompt action.",即使没有完整的信息，即将到来的感染潮前景也足以促使人们采取行动。
"Mary Ma's grandmother is nearly 90 years old and has already received two shots. Ms. Ma, who lives with her grandmother and mother in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in 2019, has worried about the adverse effects on seniors. She is also worried about inadvertently exposing her grandmother to Covid by taking her to get vaccinated, because she said the designated hospitals for vaccinations are the same as those that treat Covid patients.",玛丽·马(音)年近90岁的外婆已打过两针疫苗。马女士与外婆和母亲一起住在武汉，新冠病毒最早是2019年在那里出现的。马女士一直担心疫苗对老年人的副作用，也担心带外婆去接种疫苗会无意中让她接触到新冠病毒，因为接种疫苗的定点医院也收治感染者，马女士说。
"But Ms. Ma, 24, said she recognizes that being up-to-date on vaccinations is more important than ever now that pandemic restrictions have been lifted.",但现年24岁的马女士说，她认识到，现在及时接种疫苗比以往任何时候都更加重要，因为政府解除了遏制大流行的限制措施。
"""Even though my grandmother stays at home most of the time, I am still worried about the risk that our young family members may bring the virus back home,"" Ms. Ma said.","""虽然我外婆每天呆在家里，就怕万一我们年轻人出门把病毒带回来了，""马女士说。"
"""I think she should get vaccinated,"" she said.","""所以觉得还是应该打一下，""马女士说。"
"He met with Saudi Arabia's king and the leaders of Egypt, Tunisia, Kuwait and Sudan. He pledged to expand ports along the Red Sea, invest in petrochemicals and usher in a wave of Chinese tourism.",他会见了沙特阿拉伯国王以及埃及、突尼斯、科威特和苏丹的领导人。他承诺扩建红海沿岸港口，投资石化产品，并掀起中国人的旅游热潮。
"After years of alienating other countries with his foreign ministry's abrasive style of diplomacy and then retreating into semi-isolation for most of the pandemic, China's leader, Xi Jinping, is returning to the global stage to repair China's position and catch up to the United States, which Beijing sees as having emerged stronger from the coronavirus crisis than expected.",多年来，他的外交部门以粗暴的外交风格疏远其他国家，然后在大流行病的大部分时间里退回到半孤立状态。现在，中国领导人习近平正在重返全球舞台，以修复中国的地位并追赶美国，在北京看来，美国从新冠病毒危机中恢复过来的能力比预期的要强大。
"Saudi Arabia is the latest leg in Mr. Xi's diplomatic drive, after a soft reset with President Biden last month in Indonesia that pulled the countries' ties out of a nosedive. The Chinese leader has met with at least 29 heads of state since he emerged from the pandemic in September.",沙特阿拉伯是习近平外交努力的最新一站，上个月他与拜登总统在印度尼西亚进行了软重启，使两国关系从急转直下的状态中解脱出来。自大流行以来，这位中国领导人在9月首次外访，至今已经会见了至少29位国家元首。
"In that time, he's ended a yearslong freeze on high-level talks with Australia by meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and rolled out a red carpet for Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany in Beijing to shore up one of China's most important economic partnerships.",在那段时间里，他与澳大利亚总理安东尼·阿尔巴尼斯会面，结束了与澳大利亚长达数年的高层会谈冻结，并在北京欢迎德国总理奥拉夫·肖尔茨访华，以支持中国最重要的经济伙伴关系之一。
"On Friday, in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Mr. Xi said China plans to cooperate with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries in the fields of nuclear energy, nuclear security and space exploration.",周五，习近平在沙特首都利雅得表示，中国计划与沙特阿拉伯和其他海湾国家在核能、核安全和太空探索领域开展合作。
"The engagement is a welcome change for foreign leaders who have long wondered when they would get to hold face-to-face talks again with Mr. Xi, either to court him as the head of the world's second-largest economy, or to counter him as a powerful autocrat seeking to reshape the global order. Many come away disappointed to learn that Mr. Xi has not wavered on key issues like Taiwan or support for Russia.",对于外国领导人来说，这次接触是一个可喜的变化，他们长期以来一直想知道什么时候才能再次与习近平进行面对面会谈，要么是为了向世界第二大经济体的领导人示好，要么是为了对抗这位寻求重塑全球秩序的强大专制者。许多人在得知习近平在台湾或支持俄罗斯等关键问题上没有动摇时失望而归。
"""Xi is deliberately courting America's allies meeting or hosting the leaders of Western democracies from Germany to Japan,"" said Danny Russel, a vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and former assistant secretary of state. Now, with his visit to Saudi Arabia, ""Xi is demonstrating that the United States is not the only game in town.""","""习近平在故意拉拢美国的盟友——会见或接待从德国到日本的西方民主国家的领导人，""亚洲协会政策研究所副总裁、前助理国务卿丹尼·拉塞尔说。现在他访问沙特阿拉伯，""习近平正在证明这里不止美国一个参与者。"""
"The meetings also have domestic political value for Mr. Xi, turning the spotlight away from a difficult unwinding of his signature ""zero Covid"" policy and burnishing his image as a global leader fighting for Chinese interests.","这些会晤对习近平来说也具有国内政治价值，将人们的注意力从他标志性的""清零""政策的艰难解除上转移开，并提升了他作为为中国利益而战的全球领导人的形象。"
"Chinese state media outlets have given his travels prominent play, proclaiming that ties between China and Saudi Arabia have reached an ""important milestone!"" They highlighted the hero's welcome he received in Saudi Arabia, which included an escort from the Royal Saudi Air Force, a 21-gun salute with cannons, and a formation of Saudi aerobatic jets shooting ribbons of red and yellow vapor, in the colors of the Chinese flag.","中国官方媒体对他的出访进行了突出的报道，宣称中国和沙特阿拉伯之间的关系已经达到了""重要的里程碑!""他们强调他在沙特阿拉伯受到的英雄般的礼遇，包括沙特皇家空军的护送、21响礼炮致敬，以及沙特特技喷气机编队喷射出象征中国国旗的红色和黄色烟雾带。"
"""The Gulf summit allows the propaganda organs to shift attention to something more positive: Xi's statesmanship,"" said Willy Lam, a veteran analyst of Chinese politics in Hong Kong and a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation.","""海湾峰会让宣传机构将注意力转移到更正面的事情上:习近平的国家领导人风度，""香港中国政治资深分析师、詹姆斯敦基金会高级研究员林和立说。"
"The new diplomatic tack follows years of inward focus for Mr. Xi, who was preoccupied with blunting the effects of the pandemic and consolidating support for his norm-breaking third term at a Communist Party congress in October.",习近平在多年专注于内政之后采取了这一新外交策略，他在10月的共产党代表大会上专注于降低大流行病的影响，并巩固对他打破常规的第三个任期的支持。
"Harsh pandemic restrictions that left millions confined to their homes for long stretches and all but closed off international travel deepened China's isolation at a time when the world was growing more distrustful of Beijing and splintering into geopolitical blocs over security and technology, drawing comparisons to the Cold War.",在世界对北京越来越不信任并在安全和技术问题上分裂成地缘政治集团之际，严厉的疫情防控措施使数百万人长期封控在家，国际旅行几乎被完全关闭，这加深了中国的孤立，这种形势被与冷战相提并论。
"By contrast, the United States is coming out of the pandemic with stronger relationships in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Europe, while strengthening regional security pacts with India, Australia and Britain. At the same time, one of China's closest strategic allies, Russia, finds itself increasingly on the fringes.",相比之下，美国正从大流行中解脱出来，与日本、韩国、菲律宾和欧洲的关系更加牢固，同时加强了与印度、澳大利亚和英国的地区安全协定。与此同时，俄罗斯——中国最亲密的战略盟友之一——发现自己越来越处于边缘地位。
"Mr. Xi appears to want to steady relations with Washington, which hit their lowest point in half a century this year after Beijing froze diplomatic channels with Washington in response to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August, and after the Biden administration imposed a sweeping export ban on semiconductor technology to China in early October.",习近平似乎希望稳定与华盛顿的关系。今年中美关系跌至半个世纪以来的最低点。8月，议长南希·佩洛西访问台湾，北京以冻结与华盛顿的外交渠道作为回应。10月初，拜登政府实施了一项全面禁止向中国出口半导体技术的禁令。
"The relationship began to thaw after the party congress, when senior Chinese foreign ministry officials started engaging with Western countries again, a Western official said.",一位西方官员说，党代会后，中国外交部高级官员再次开始与西方国家接触，两国关系开始解冻。
That led to the closely watched meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Biden on Nov. 14 at the Group of 20 summit in Indonesia.,这促成习近平和拜登于11月14日在印度尼西亚举行的20国集团峰会上举行了备受关注的会晤。
"China's re-engagement does not spell an end to Beijing's assertive posture under Mr. Xi, a leader who has depicted the West as hostile bullies and inspired a pugnacious brand of ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy, named after a pair of nationalistic action films.","中国的重新参与并不意味着北京在习近平领导下的强势姿态结束，这位领导人将西方描绘成充满敌意的恶霸，并激励了一种具有挑衅性的""战狼""外交，其名源于两部民族主义动作片。"
"Mr. Xi has not relented on the thorniest issues dividing China and the West Beijing's increasing pressure on Taiwan, its crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong, and support for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as he wages war in Ukraine, to name a few.",在中国和西方有分歧的问题上，习近平在最棘手的问题上毫不留情——例如，北京对台湾施加越来越大的压力，打压香港的自由，支持俄罗斯总统普京在乌克兰发动战争。
"Western experts say it's too early to declare Mr. Xi's recharged diplomacy a charm offensive not until they see China abandon some of its more coercive behavior, like its blocking of imports from Lithuania to punish the Baltic state for agreeing to let Taiwan open a trade office in its capital, Vilnius, last year.",西方专家表示，现在就将习近平重新激活的外交称作魅力攻势还为时过早——除非他们看到中国放弃一些更具胁迫性的行为，比如阻止从立陶宛进口商品，以此惩罚该波罗的海国家去年同意让台湾在其首都维尔纽斯设立贸易办公室。
"A more accurate reading on Mr. Xi might be gleaned from his confrontation with Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at the end of the Group of 20 summit. Mr. Xi was caught by a news camera scolding Mr. Trudeau and accusing him of leaking a conversation between the two leaders. When Mr. Trudeau suggested that the pair work through their disagreements, Mr. Xi bristled and said, ""Let's create the conditions first.""","从习近平在20国集团峰会结束时与加拿大总理贾斯汀·特鲁多的对峙或许能得到对他更准确的解读。新闻镜头拍到习近平指责特鲁多，称他泄露了两国领导人的谈话。当特鲁多建议两人解决分歧时，习近平不悦地说，""(我们首先要)创造条件。"""
"That self-assuredness is why analysts don't expect Mr. Xi to appear chastened by the protests last month against China's strict pandemic measures and the subsequent collapse of his ""zero Covid"" policy, which he had held up as an example of the country's superiority in preventing the high numbers of deaths seen elsewhere.","习近平的这种胸有成竹让分析人士认为他不会因上个月的抗议活动以及""清零""政策随后瓦解而表现出缓和。上个月人们针对中国严格的疫情防控措施进行了抗议，而他坚持认为""清零""政策是该国在防止其他国家出现的大量死亡方面具有优越性。"
"""From Beijing's perspective,"" Mr. Russel said, ""the surge of diplomacy following Xi's extended self-quarantine and his triumphal reappointment at the 20th party congress reflects Beijing's growing pre-eminence on the international stage.""","""从北京的角度来看，""拉塞尔说，""习近平长期自我隔离后的外交热潮以及在第20届党代会上的胜利连任，反映了北京在国际舞台上日益突出的地位。"""
"That was underscored by the pomp of Mr. Xi's Saudi welcome, marking the Chinese leader's first visit to the kingdom in six years. The pageantry contrasted with Mr. Biden's more subdued visit to Saudi Arabia over the summer, remembered best for an awkward fist-bump greeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler.",习近平在沙特得到的热烈欢迎凸显了这一点，这是这位中国领导人六年来首次访问沙特。盛大的场面与拜登在夏季对沙特阿拉伯的访问形成鲜明对比，拜登与沙特阿拉伯事实上的统治者王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼尴尬地碰拳问候。
"Mr. Xi, who is hoping to weaken U.S. influence in the region, held talks with King Salman of Saudi Arabia on Thursday and signed a strategic partnership agreement with the kingdom. The pact strengthens diplomatic and economic ties in an already complex relationship that has diversified beyond oil to include arms, technology and infrastructure.",习近平希望削弱美国在该地区的影响力，他在周四与沙特阿拉伯国王萨勒曼举行了会谈，并与该国签署了战略伙伴关系协议。该协议加强了外交和经济关系，而两国本已复杂的关系已经从石油领域扩展到武器、技术和基础设施领域。
"The Chinese leader's arrival in Saudi Arabia comes as relations between Washington and Riyadh have steadily frayed, first over the 2018 murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and, most recently, over the October decision to cut oil production by OPEC Plus, an energy producers' cartel in which Saudi Arabia wields a key role.",中国领导人抵达沙特阿拉伯之际，正值华盛顿和利雅得之间的关系不断恶化，首先是2018年华盛顿邮报专栏作家贾迈勒·卡舒吉被谋杀，而最近，OPEC+于10月决定削减石油产量，沙特阿拉伯在该能源生产组织中发挥着关键作用。
"The Gulf is considered ripe for Chinese expansion because of growing perceptions among Saudi officials, scholars and businesspeople that the United States has lost interest and is diverting resources to Asia and Europe.",人们认为中国在海湾的扩张时机已成熟，因为沙特官员、学者和商人越来越认为美国已经失去兴趣，并将资源转移到亚洲和欧洲。
"Unlike Washington, Beijing is not asking leaders to choose sides. China's stated policy of noninterference means that issues like human rights never get in the way of business. Beijing says it accepts Riyadh's flimsy explanation for Mr. Khashoggi's death, while the Saudis have rejected efforts to condemn China's mass detention of Muslim Uyghurs.",与华盛顿不同，北京并不要求领导人选边站。中国声明的不干涉政策意味着人权等问题永远不会妨碍生意。北京表示，它接受利雅得对卡舒吉之死的站不住脚的解释，而沙特则拒绝谴责中国对维吾尔穆斯林的大规模拘禁。
"Friendly relations in the Gulf are paramount for China, which counts on the region as its top supplier of oil. It's also a key node along its Belt and Road Initiative, and an important market for Chinese consumer goods and technology. Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, which is banned in the United States, provides 5G networks in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.","海湾地区的友好关系对中国来说至关重要，该地区是其最大的石油供应国。它也是""一带一路""倡议的重要节点，并且是中国消费品和技术的重要市场。在美国被禁止的中国电信巨头华为在沙特阿拉伯、卡塔尔、科威特和阿拉伯联合酋长国提供5G网络。"
"""With the U.S. in retreat and Russia caught in the Ukraine crisis, China can play a constructive role in the transformation of the Middle East regional order,"" Cui Shoujun, a professor at Renmin University's School of International Studies in Beijing, said of Mr. Xi's ambitions in the region.","""当美国节节败退、俄罗斯又陷入乌克兰危机，中国可以在中东地区的秩序转型中发挥根本性作用，""位于北京的中国人民大学国际关系学院教授崔守军这样评价习近平在该地区的野心。"
"The contest for countries like those in the Gulf region could grow more fierce as the United States and its closest allies harden their positions on China. In his first foreign policy speech as Britain's prime minister last month, Rishi Sunak declared the ""golden era"" of relations with China over. And in Canada, a long-anticipated government Indo-Pacific strategy paper released last month described China as ""an increasingly disruptive global power.""","随着美国及其最亲密盟友的对华立场愈发强硬，在诸如海湾地区等国家的争夺可能会变得更激励。上个月，里希·苏纳克在上任英国首相后的首次外交政策讲话中宣布，对华关系的""黄金时代""已经终结。在加拿大，受期待已久的政府印太战略文件于上个月发布，将中国描述为""一个破坏性日增的全球力量""。"
"Mr. Xi is wagering that he can weather those more difficult relationships if he can win enough support in the global south and persuade U.S. partners that their economic futures are wedded to China's economy. Hindering his efforts is the war in Ukraine, which has demonstrated to Europe the perils of growing too dependent on an adversary.",习近平正在赌如果能在南方世界赢得足够多的支持，并让美国的合作伙伴相信其经济未来与中国经济紧密相连，他就可以承受住那些关系恶化带来的后果。乌克兰战争阻挠了他的努力，因其向欧洲证明了过度依赖对手的危险。
"""China missed a crucial opportunity to rehabilitate ties with the West when Russia invaded Ukraine,"" said Yuen Yuen Ang, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan who studies China. ""Initially, a minority of pragmatists in Beijing warned that siding with Russia in an unjust war would further isolate China. This prediction has come true. So now, Beijing is under intense pressure to find new friends.""","""当俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，中国错过了一个修复对西方关系的重大机遇，""研究中国问题的密歇根大学政治学教授洪源远说。""北京的实用主义少数派起初警告称，在一场非正义战争中支持俄罗斯会导致中国的处境进一步被孤立。这一预言已经成为现实。所以到现在，北京正面临寻找新盟友的巨大压力。"""
"Until recently, China, the world's most populous nation, was also the world's last Covid holdout. But in a matter of weeks it will be hit by a wave that a top health official predicts could infect many hundreds of millions of people.",作为全球第一人口大国，中国直到最近都仍是世界上最后一个坚持抵抗新冠的国家。但在未来几周，中国将迎来一大波疫情的冲击，一名高级卫生官员预测可能会有多达数亿人感染。
"This week, Beijing took its biggest step toward living with Covid, all but abandoning an unpopular and costly ""zero Covid"" policy of lockdowns and mass quarantines it had hoped would eliminate infections. The abrupt pivot has raised the specter of tremendous strain on a health care system that is overstretched even in normal times. That could get worse in a month, when people travel across the country to see their families during the Lunar New Year holiday.","本周，北京朝着与新冠共存迈出了最重大的一步，彻底放弃了不受欢迎且代价高昂的""新冠清零""政策，即通过封锁和大规模隔离来达到清除感染的目的。这一急转弯引发了对医疗系统压力过大的担忧，即便在常态下，医疗系统也已经处于超负荷运转状态。一个月后情况可能变得更糟，届时全国各地的民众都将在春节期间踏上探亲的旅途。"
"Feng Zijian, an adviser on China's Covid task force, said this week that the surge could infect 60 percent of the country's 1.4 billion population or more than 840 million people. For most Chinese, it will be their first encounter with Covid.",中国新冠防控专家组的顾问冯子健本周表示，这波激增的疫情可能会感染全国14亿人口的60%，即超过8.4亿人。对于大多数中国人来说，这将是他们第一次接触新冠病毒。
"Like many countries, China is now facing Omicron variants that are highly infectious, but have so far been milder than earlier iterations. Unlike the rest of the world, China had nearly three years to prepare for this surge. But it spent most of that time focusing on lockdowns instead of on vaccinations and preparing the population for living with Covid, a prospect that many experts had warned would be inevitable.",与许多国家一样，中国如今面临奥密克戎变异株的威胁，这种病毒具有高传染性，但目前要比此前的变异株更加温和。与全世界不同的是，中国有近三年的时间来为感染激增做好准备。但它把大部分时间都花在了封控而非疫苗接种之上，未能帮助民众做好与新冠共存的准备，哪怕许多专家都警告过，这样的结果不可避免。
"""A tsunami of cases is coming no matter if they stick to zero Covid or not,"" said Jin Dong-Yan, a virologist at Hong Kong University.","""无论他们是否坚持新冠清零，都会出现大量感染，""香港大学病毒学家金冬雁说。"
"The question is how many cases will become severe and require more serious medical attention. Even the current picture is unclear. According to official data released by the National Health Commission, there were 159 severe cases of Covid nationwide by Friday, an increase of about 60 from the start of the month.",问题在于有多少感染者会发展为重症，需要更多医疗护理。甚至连当下情形都并不明朗。根据国家卫健委公布的官方数据，截至周五，全国共有159例重症患者，比本月初增加了约60例。
"""That number is still very low because in reality there should be many more confirmed cases that are going underreported now,"" Mr. Jin said. Another difficulty: the definition of a ""severe"" case can vary from one city to another, he added.","""这个数字还是很低，因为实际上现在应该有很多确诊病例被漏报，""金冬雁说。他还补充说，另一个难点在于，对""重症""的定义可能因地而异。"
"What is clear is that the government is bracing for the wave to be big. Officials on Friday announced plans to double the capacity of critical care beds and to increase the number of doctors and nurses staffing such wards. Also in the works: to upgrade temporary facilities previously built to quarantine people deemed close contacts, turning them into secondary hospitals. Officials additionally said that workers at the community level would classify residents by risk level assigning color codes denoting risk based on vaccination status, age, and other health conditions, a shift away from surveillance that had tracked residents based on contact tracing and infections.",可以确定的是，政府正在为这波感染巨浪做准备。官方周五宣布，计划将医院的重症监护床位容量翻一倍，并为其增加医护人手。此外还要升级以往为隔离密接者建造的临时设施，将其改为亚定点医院。官员们还表示，社区工作人员将划分居民风险级别，根据疫苗接种情况、年龄和其他健康状况，为其分配不同颜色的标记，代表不同程度的风险，不再依据密接追踪和感染情况监测居民。
"China wants to ration hospital beds for the most severe cases, but officials now need to convince the majority of infected people to stay home, despite having told them for years to fear Covid. A triage system has been set up to funnel Covid patients to community health centers, but most people are unaccustomed to seeing a doctor outside the hospital. The government is relying on an army of volunteers to field phone calls and deliver cold medicine and Covid test kits to the sick at home, but there are already early signs of understaffing and of shortages of the necessary supplies.",中国希望将医院床位留给病情最重的感染者，但几年来一直在渲染新冠恐惧的官员们现在要做的，是说服大多数感染者居家隔离。将新冠患者安排至社区卫生中心就诊的分流机制已经建立，但大多数民众并不习惯去医院以外的地方看病。政府依靠大批志愿者拨打电话，为居家病例送去感冒药品和新冠病毒检测试剂盒，但已有初步迹象表明人手配备不足，必要用品也出现短缺。
"To some extent, the complications China is facing as it opens up are not unique. Other countries that have shifted from strict pandemic controls to adapting to the virus have experienced some level of shock as people unused to the virus flooded hospitals for help. But in places like Singapore and New Zealand, that change was more controlled. Officials removed restrictions only after telling the public what to expect and when, allowing hospital systems more time to prepare for the oncoming surge, and citizens more time to get vaccinated.",某种程度上，中国在开放过程中面临的复杂情况并不特殊。从严防疫情转向适应病毒的国家都经历了一定的冲击，因为不习惯病毒的民众会涌入医院寻求帮助。但在新加坡和新西兰等地，转变是比较可控的。官员们在告知公众未来将出现何种情况之后才放松了管制，让医院系统有更多时间为即将到来的感染激增做准备，也让公民有更多时间完成疫苗接种。
"""Singapore adopted a cautious approach with a gradual opening up,"" said Paul Anantharajah Tambyah, a practicing infectious diseases doctor and president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. Mild and moderate cases were treated outside of the hospital system, he added. ""That helped communications a lot and was easier for the general population to accept than a dramatic shift towards a 'business as usual' approach.""","""新加坡采取了逐步放开的谨慎办法，""执业传染病医师兼亚太临床微生物学及感染病会主席保罗·安纳塔拉贾·坦比亚说。他还表示，轻度和中度病例都得在医院系统之外接受治疗。""这对沟通大有助益，对大众来说也比'一切恢复如常'那种急转弯更易于接受。"""
"China is only now trying to step up a vaccination campaign that had mostly stalled in the spring as resources were diverted to building and enforcing a national mass testing system. More than 600 million vaccinated people have not yet received a booster shot, a necessary prerequisite to prevent serious cases among those given the Chinese vaccines, which have been proven to be weaker, according to the World Health Organization. Among those 80 and older, only 40 percent have had booster vaccinations.",中国现在才开始加速疫苗接种，由于资源都被转移到全国性大规模检测系统的建设和执行之上，这项工作在春季已基本停滞。根据世界卫生组织的数据，中国有超过6亿疫苗接种者尚未注射加强针，这是预防接种已被证明防护力较弱的中国疫苗的人出现严重病例的必要先决条件。在80岁及以上的人群中，只有40%的人接种了加强针。
"After the loosening was announced on Wednesday, officials hastened to write new guidelines on everything from home isolation to rapid antigen testing and to free up resources for a coming deluge of cases.",在周三宣布放松后，官员们匆忙编写了从居家隔离到抗原检测在内的各种新规定，并为即将到来的大规模感染腾出资源。
"Dale Fisher, a professor of medicine and the head of the National Infection Prevention and Control Committee of Singapore's Health Ministry, said that Chinese health officials would need to ensure that extra hospital beds were ready, ventilators on hand and medical staff redeployed.",医学教授兼新加坡卫生部国家感染防控委员会主席戴尔·费舍尔表示，中国卫生官员必须准备好更多病床、随时可用的呼吸机，并对医务人员进行调动。
"China has moved quickly in recent days to do this, more than doubling its intensive care bed capacity to 10 beds per 100,000 people, up from less than four just a month ago.",中国近来迅速采取行动，将重症监护床位的数量增加了一倍多，从一个月前的每10万人不到四张增加到了10张。
"The National Health Commission on Friday also said it could redirect 106,000 doctors and 177,700 nurses to intensive care units. According to the most recent official figures reported in 2020, China has three registered nurses for every 1,000 people and two practicing physicians for every 1,000 people.",国家卫健委周五还表示，可能将106000名医生和177700名护士调至重症监护病房工作。根据最近于2020年公布的官方数据，中国为每千人服务的注册护士为三人，执业医师则为两人。
"Some of the changes have created confusion as authorities act quickly in response to new measures. In cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the authorities removed many testing booths almost as soon as the new guidelines on Wednesday called for testing requirements to be limited. But by Friday, the National Health Commission said that testing sites should not be arbitrarily removed, and that they should be made available for those who need to enter nursing homes and medical facilities, where a negative test result is still required.",随着当局对新措施迅速作出反应，一些变动带来了混乱。在北京、上海等城市，周三要求减少核酸检测的新规刚下达，当局就拆除了许多检测点。但到周五，国家卫健委又表示不应随意拆除检测点，这些检测点应为那些必须进入仍需核酸阴性证明的养老院和医疗机构的人开放。
"As cases mount in Beijing, many people have been lining up at hospitals and laying in supplies of fever-reducing medication and home test kits. Some city residents reported that hospitals were turning away people with symptoms, telling them that their cases must first be reported by local neighborhood officials.",随着北京的感染增加，许多人在医院排起长队购买退烧药和家用检测试剂盒。一些城市的居民报告说，医院拒绝接诊有症状的人，告知他们阳性病例必须先由街道官员报告。
"Wakeman Wang, a resident in Beijing, said he had hoped to take his 7-year-old son to see a doctor after he had briefly choked on a fish bone earlier this week. But the boy had tested positive for Covid. Mr. Wang's local neighborhood worker tasked with overseeing pandemic policies at the community level told him health workers were unable to arrange a closed-loop transfer to a hospital and suggested that Mr. Wang either take the child to the hospital by himself or call family doctors.",北京居民韦克曼·王说，他七岁的儿子本周早些时候被鱼骨卡了喉咙，他想带儿子看医生，但儿子的核酸结果是阳性。负责监督社区防疫政策的居委会工作人员告诉他，医务人员无法安排就医的闭环转诊，建议他要么自己带孩子去医院，要么致电家庭医生。
"Mr. Wang said his wife tried calling several local family doctors who had been quickly assembled to help sort out community medical issues, but none of the numbers she tried worked.",韦克曼·王说他的妻子试着给当地好几位家庭医生打电话，这些医生曾被迅速召集起来帮助解决社区医疗问题，但没有一个号码能打通。
"""I felt desperate and guilty,"" he said. ""When my child was in danger, I couldn't solve the problem, and I couldn't ensure his safety.""","""我很绝望也很内疚，""韦克曼·王说。""当我的孩子遇到危险，我却没法解决问题，也没法确保他的安全。"""
"Scarlet Zhang, a resident in Fengtai, a district in the city's southwest, said she tried to go to a hospital after testing positive with a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit.",北京市西南部丰台区居民斯佳丽·张说，她在检测呈阳性且发烧近38摄氏度之后试图前往医院就医。
"She said she tried several times to call an ambulance, but the municipal emergency number, comparable to 911 in the United States, was always busy. A pharmacy near her home was out of fever medication, she said.",她说自己叫了好几次救护车，但打120总是占线。她说她家附近一家药店已经没有退烧药了。
"""It is my third day having a fever, I cannot get advice from a professional, and I don't know what to do now,"" she said.","""我都发烧三天了，没有专业人士给我建议，我现在不知道该怎么办，""她说。"
"Because of the hard line previously taken on the severity of the virus, Chinese officials now face a big challenge to assuage the public's fears, Mr. Fisher said.",费舍尔表示，由于此前对病毒严重性的不妥协立场，中国官员如今的巨大挑战在于如何缓解公众的恐惧心理。
"""The messaging to the public is really tricky when you've been saying for two to three years that this is deadly, and now you are saying, 'If you get it, just stay home and isolate yourself,'"" he added.","""两三年来一直宣称病毒是致命的，现在却说'感染了就在家里自我隔离'，让公众接受这种信息难度是很大的，""他补充道。"
"After the Chinese government announced this week that it would retreat from its harsh Covid policies, many Chinese expressed their gratitude to the protesters who had boldly spoken out against the punishing restrictions. After three long years, people throughout China could try to get back to normal life.",在中国政府本周宣布将放弃严厉的新冠病毒政策后，许多中国人对那些勇敢反对惩罚性限制措施的抗议者表达了感激之情。经历了漫长的三年，全中国的民众都可以努力恢复正常生活了。
"""Thank you, brave young people"" was a widely shared comment on Chinese social media platforms. Some people posted Time magazine's new ""Heroes of the Year"" cover, honoring Iranian women, and compared China's protesters to them: ""Salute the brave women of Iran. Salute the brave young people.""","在中国的社交媒体平台上，人们纷纷转发""谢谢年轻人""这样一句评论。有人贴出《时代》杂志最新一期伊朗女性荣获""年度英雄""的封面，将中国的抗议者与她们相提并论:""向伊朗勇敢的女性致敬。向勇敢的年轻人致敬。"""
"But many of those who protested last month were reluctant to celebrate, because they want more: They want the government to concede that ""zero Covid"" was a grave mistake. They're still filled with anger, frustration and sadness. Newly empowered by activism, they want to keep fighting for their rights and to hold their government accountable.","但许多上个月参加抗议的人觉得还没有到庆祝的时候，因为他们想更进一步:希望政府承认""清零""是一个严重的错误。他们仍有满腔的愤怒、沮丧和悲伤。政治行动主义赋予他们新的力量，他们希望继续为自己的权利而战，并追究政府的责任。"
"They are gratified that the Chinese public is being freed from the constant tests, quarantines and lockdowns that have become fixtures of their lives. Yet they're angry that the government hasn't apologized, and probably never will, for its misstep one that caused much unnecessary death and hardship.",他们很高兴看到中国公众正在从长期的检测、隔离和封锁中摆脱出来，这些措施已经成为了大家生活中的一部分。然而，令他们愤怒的是，政府没有为失误道歉，而且可能永远也不会道歉——这一失误造成了许多不必要的死亡和苦难。
"They know their destinies are still subject to the will of one person, the country's top leader, Xi Jinping. They're worried that China's lack of proper preparation for eased restrictions will leave the public once again suffering the consequences of bad governance.",他们知道，自己的命运仍然受制于一个人的意志，即国家最高领导人习近平。他们担心，中国在放宽限制方面缺乏适当的准备，将使公众再次遭受治理不善的后果。
"Miranda, a journalist who protested in Shanghai, said her biggest takeaway from three years of ""zero Covid"" was that people can die when a country takes a wrong turn. ""That cost is too high,"" she said.","曾在上海参加抗议活动的记者米兰达说，她从三年的""清零""中获取的最重要的经验是，一个国家走错路线会导致死亡。""这个牺牲着实太大了，""她说。"
"Another protester, Tung, a college student in the eastern city of Nanjing, invoked the memory of the doctor who was silenced in 2020 after trying to warn China about the coronavirus. He later died of the virus.",另一名抗议者董同学是东部城市南京的一名大学生，他回忆起那位试图向中国发出新冠病毒警告的医生，后来这位医生于2020年被噤声。他后来死于新冠病毒。
"""Dr. Li Wenliang won't be able to come back,"" she said. ""Nor will many people who lost their lives under the overzealous pandemic control policies. Or the dignity that was denied and trampled upon. Or the normal campus life of our college years.""","""李文亮不会回来，""她说。""因为过度防疫政策失去生命的人不会回来，被践踏，受屈辱的尊严不会回来。我们作为大学生，失去三年多正常大学生活再也回不来了。"""
"Calling herself and her fellow protesters ""people of destiny,"" she said, ""I will keep fighting.""","她称自己和参加抗议活动的同伴都是""被时代选中的人""。她说:""我一定会长期战斗下去。"""
It's hard to tell to what extent the November protests the most political and widespread since the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations played a role in the government's decision to lift the restrictions sooner than most people had expected. The economy had been tanking for a while. There had been many confrontations between local authorities and residents.,政府做出了解除限制的决定，早于大多数人的预期，很难判断这在多大程度上是由11月的抗议活动促成的。这次抗议活动是自1989年民主示威以来最具政治性和最广泛的一次。经济已经低迷了一段时间。地方当局和民众之间发生过多次冲突。
"But the reason Beijing acted when it did was obvious to many who took part in the demonstrations, as well as some who did not: The protests broke open a crack in an oppressive darkness, letting in light and hope.",但对许多参加示威的人和一部分没有参加示威的人来说，中国政府采取行动的原因都是显而易见的:抗议活动在压抑的黑暗中打开了一道裂缝，带进了光明和希望。
"""Because of the protesters, I'm full of hope for China's future,"" said Tate, who has been a high school teacher for more than three decades in the southern city of Shenzhen. Ye Qing, a legal scholar in Beijing, wrote on Twitter about a Nov. 27 protest in Shanghai: ""This is when the people restarted this country. Time may have finally started.""","""因为这些抗议者，我现在对中国的未来充满信心，""在南方城市深圳当了三十多年高中教师的泰特说。北京的法学家叶青在Twitter上写到11月27日上海的抗议活动时说:""这是人民重启这个国家的第一秒钟，时间也许真的开始了。"""
"The protesters I have talked to are sober about their role, and about the future.",与我交谈过的抗议者都很清醒地意识到他们的角色和未来。
"But they are now even more motivated to take their destiny into their own hands. They realize that because they cannot vote, the government is free to impose more policies like ""zero Covid,"" just as it caused disasters like the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution in their parents' and grandparents' generations.","但他们现在更有动力将自己的命运掌握在自己手中。他们意识到，因为不能投票，政府可以自由地实施更多类似""清零""的政策，如同他们的父母和祖父母那一代遭受的大跃进和文化大革命那样的灾难。"
They know they're confronting the most powerful authoritarian government on the planet and the most iron-fisted Chinese leader in decades. Their recent protests certainly had no impact on the power structure in Beijing.,他们明白，自己面对的是全世界最强大的专制政府和数十年来中国最铁腕的领导人。他们近来的抗议活动当然不会影响到北京的权力架构。
"But they broke the myth that it's beyond challenge. Overnight, many Chinese, especially the young protesters, realized that Mr. Xi isn't God and his grip on power isn't unbreakable, several Chinese scholars told me.",但他们打破了不可挑战的神话。几位中国学者告诉我，一夜之间，许多中国人——尤其是年轻抗议者——都意识到习近平并非上帝，他对权力的掌控也并非牢不可破。
"I have been talking to the protesters almost every day, and I've heard this sentiment over and over: ""One person shouldn't have so much power.""","我几乎每天都与抗议者交流，不断听到这样的说法:""一个人不应该有那么大权力。"""
"Three of them were detained by the police for 24 hours, and another was called in for questioning. A fifth person I spoke to was harassed repeatedly by her student counselor, who even called her parents. The others are lying low.",其中三名抗议者被警方拘留了24小时，还有一人被叫去问话。与我交谈过的第五名抗议者被辅导员多次骚扰，后者甚至还打电话给她的父母。其他抗议者都选择低调行事。
"All of them said they wouldn't hesitate to take to the streets in the future or get involved in other forms of protest, such as using the iPhone's Airdrop feature to share slogans with subway riders or writing them out as graffiti on public toilets.",他们均表示，今后还是会毫不犹豫地走上街头，或是选择其他抗议形式，比如利用iPhone的隔空投送功能向地铁乘客分享抗议口号，或在公共厕所涂鸦。
"All the people I interviewed asked me to use no more than their first name, family name, nickname or English name to protect their safety.",我采访的所有人为了安全，都要求我仅使用他们的名、姓、昵称或英文名。
"One of the protesters who were detained said her blood had been drawn, her irises scanned and her phone taken away. She was ordered to take all her clothes off for a body cavity search. The experience left her fearful. Still, she shared her experience on my Chinese podcast, so others would know what to expect.",一名被拘捕的抗议者说，她被抽血和虹膜扫描，手机也被没收。她还被要求脱光所有衣服进行体腔检查。这次经历让她十分害怕。尽管如此，她还是在我的中文播客上将她的经历分享出来，好让其他人知道后果是什么样的。
"She said she hadn't been political in the past. But that changed after censors deleted eight of her accounts on the Weibo platform because she had posted, or reposted, about tragic social events, many of which involved women.",她说自己以前没有参与过政治。但因为发布或转发关于悲惨社会事件的内容(其中许多都涉及女性议题)，导致她被微博平台八次删除账号，之后她的态度发生了转变。
"People protested for different reasons, she said. For her, it was about freedom of speech; for some others, it was a cry to be free of censorship, to watch the movies they wanted. But they share a goal: They want a new government.",她说，大家抗议的原因各有不同。她要的是言论自由;另一些人呼吁废除审查制度，看他们想看的电影。但他们都有共同的目标，那就是希望建立一个新式政府。
The future of the movement that these protesters hope they have started lies in two things: their organization and the public's support.,这些抗议者点燃的运动未来能否存续取决于两点:他们的组织水平，以及公众的支持。
"They won over some middle-aged people, who experienced their own political awakenings. A few of them have reached out to me to express their gratitude to protesters.",他们赢得了一些中年群体的支持，这些人也经历了自己的政治觉醒。其中一些人向我表达了他们对抗议者的感激之情。
The protesters know that it's nearly impossible to compete with a government that has the most technologically sophisticated propaganda apparatus in human history.,抗议者都清楚，与一个拥有人类历史上技术最先进的宣传机器的政府对抗，基本不可能有胜算。
"Miranda, the journalist, said she planned to spend more time talking to her friends, trying to win them over. The next time protesters make their voices heard, she said, they will have more supporters on their side.",那位叫米兰达的记者说，她打算与朋友进行更多对话，努力赢得他们的支持。她说，等到下一次抗议者再发出自己的声音，就会有更多人站在他们这边。
"One evening last month, Atong, another student in Nanjing, went out by himself to post handwritten protest signs, because he didn't trust anyone enough to ask them to come along, and because two people would have been more conspicuous. Now he is one of 80 students from his university in an encrypted chat group, who call themselves ""rebels"" and are exchanging ideas about what to do next.","上月的一个晚上，南京学生阿彤(音)独自在外张贴手写的抗议标语，他无法信任任何人，不敢邀请其他人一起，而且两人行动会更加引人注目。现在，他成为了所在大学一个加密聊天群里80名学生的一员，他们自称""叛逆者""，正在讨论下一步该怎么办。"
"He pointed to a few recent rallies at universities, at which students successfully negotiated changes in Covid policies with their administrators. That would have been unimaginable a few weeks earlier, he said.",他指出，在最近几次大学集会中，学生们都通过与校方谈判成功改变了新冠政策。他说，这在几周前都是不可想象的。
"But, I asked the demonstrators, what if this quiet resistance fizzles out? What if years pass and nothing changes?",但我也问了这些示威者，如果这种低调的抵抗失败了怎么办?如果几年后一切还没有改变怎么办?
"Most said they were ready to stay at it. A recent college graduate, Xia, said she had witnessed the government cracking down on the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. people like her in recent years. She felt she had to fight back.",大多数抗议者表示，他们做好了坚持到底的准备。刚从大学毕业的夏某说，近年来政府打压像她这样的L.G.B.T.Q.群体的权利，她都看在眼里。她觉得自己必须反击。
"""It could take us five to 10 years or even more,"" she said. ""For many of us, we would be satisfied if we could see a free and democratic China in our lifetime.""","""可能五到十年，甚至十几年，""她说。""很多人说有生之年能看到发生改变的话就已经很欣慰了。"""
"At a hospital in the affluent Beijing district of Chaoyang, close to 100 people lined up outdoors in near-freezing weather on Friday at a clinic designated for fever patients. Some residents flocked to pharmacies, buying up dwindling stocks of at-home antigen coronavirus test kits and herbal medicines. Many chose to stay home, leaving the capital's usually busy streets quiet except for the puttering of motorbikes driven by food delivery workers.",在北京富裕的朝阳区一家医院外，上周五有近100人在接近零度的寒冷气温下排队等待看发热门诊。有些居民涌进药店抢购库存越来越少的抗原检测试剂盒和中药。许多人选择待在家里，让首都通常繁忙的街道异常安静，只剩下外卖送餐员骑摩托车从路上经过的声音。
"Beijing is bracing for a surge in coronavirus cases, as extensive controls that had kept the virus at bay for nearly three years have been abruptly abandoned this week after China rolled back its strict pandemic policy.",北京正在为新冠病毒感染病例激增做准备。随着中国上周放松了严格的大流行防控政策，各地已突然放弃了曾将病毒遏制了近三年的大规模控制措施。
"Across the country, officials have been scrambling to protect hospitals from being overwhelmed as more people become infected. At many of Beijing's hospitals, health workers screen people who show up with fevers to identify those who are seriously ill and send home those with milder symptoms.",随着感染者越来越多，各地官员已想尽办法防止出现医疗挤兑。在北京的许多医院，医护人员对发热者进行初筛，找到症状严重者，并让症状较轻的人回家。
"Part of the challenge for the ruling Communist Party is that less than 1 percent of people in China have had Covid through November, and so many are vulnerable to infection. The general public has also been told by state media for nearly three years that the virus leads to severe illness and death, a justification for the lockdowns and mass quarantines that set off widespread protests last month in a rare challenge to the government.",执政的中共面临的部分挑战是，截至今年11月，中国只有不到1%的人感染过新冠病毒，还有众多易感人群。近三年来，官媒也一直向公众传达新冠病毒会导致严重疾病和死亡的信息，为大范围封控和大规模集中隔离提供理由。这些防疫措施在上个月引发了大范围的抗议活动，让政府受到了一次罕见的挑战。
"Health experts and Chinese officials are stepping up efforts to urge residents not to go to hospitals unless necessary. With the help of the government's propaganda apparatus, they have been assuring residents that they have little to fear from the Omicron variants currently spreading around the country.",卫生专家和中国官员正在加紧努力，呼吁居民非必要不去医院。政府的宣传机器正在帮助官员们向老百姓打保票，不必担心目前在全国蔓延的奥密克戎变异株。
"""The infections are not scary,"" Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory scientist who is highly regarded in China, said at a conference on Friday that was covered by state media. ""Ninety-nine percent of the people who get infected can fully recover within 7 to 10 days. As long as we get plenty of rest, isolate ourselves and stay at home, we can recover quickly.""","据官媒报道，在国内享有盛誉的呼吸系统疾病专家钟南山上周五在一个会议上说，""奥密克戎感染不可怕，99%可在7-10天内完全恢复，重点应放在防控重症上(自我保护，定点医院，医护人员保护)。"""
"As the government has moved away from mass testing and contact tracing to focus on ramping up vaccinations and treating those who are severely ill, the scale of China's outbreaks is increasingly unclear. Nationwide, the number of new cases has fallen, to just over 16,000 on Thursday, down from around 40,000 a day in early December a decline so unlikely that even a prominent nationalist called the picture ""distorted"" and questioned the need for the government to continue releasing case counts.","随着政府不再进行全员核酸检测、不再追踪接触者，而是将重点放在加强疫苗接种和治疗重症患者上，人们对中国目前的感染规模越来越不清楚。全国范围内，日均新增确诊病例已从12月初的约4万例下降到上周四的1.6万多例，下降得如此不可思议，就连一位著名的民族主义者也称""数字严重失真""，并质疑政府是否有必要继续发布感染病例数。"
"""This problem should be exposed, and the numbers should be returned to their true appearance, or they should not be reported at all,"" said Hu Xijin, the former editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, on Weibo, a popular social media site. ""This is not conducive to maintaining the seriousness of official information nor is it conducive to shaping everyone's objective understanding of the spread of the epidemic.""","""应该把这个问题捅破，让数字回归真实面貌，或者干脆不报了，""中共报纸《环球时报》前总编辑胡锡进在微博上写道。""这不利于维护官方信息的严肃性，也不利于塑造大家对疫情传播情况的客观认知。"""
"In Beijing, where P.C.R. testing booths have disappeared from many sidewalks, at least 2,600 cases were recorded on Thursday, according to the government, but that tally is widely seen as a significant undercount.",北京许多设置在人行道上的核酸采样亭已经消失，市政府上周四通报了至少2600例新增感染，但人们普遍认为这个数字严重过低。
"A gray-haired woman near the front of the line on Friday evening at a fever clinic next to a hospital in the Chaoyang district said that she had been standing outdoors in the line for almost five hours. The woman who only gave her family name, Liu, in discussing her personal health said that she had developed a mild fever on Thursday that lingered on Friday.",上周五晚，在朝阳区一家医院旁边的发热门诊，排在队伍最前面的一名头发花白的女子说，她已经在室外排了近五个小时的队。由于讨论的是个人健康问题，这名女子只说自己姓刘，她说她周四开始发低烧，到了周五还没退。
"""I couldn't find any cold or fever medicine in any pharmacy, so I came here,"" she said. ""I did not expect I would wait such a long time.""","""我在药店买不到感冒药退烧药，所以来了，""她说。""没想到要等那么长时间。"""
"Although the line at the fever clinic had about only 100 people, it moved very slowly. A few workers in hazmat suits, N95 masks and plastic face shields were stationed inside and were screening patients.",排队看发热门诊的人虽然只有100名左右，但队伍向前移动的速度非常慢。几名身穿防护服、戴着N95口罩和塑料防护面罩的工作人员在里面对患者进行初筛。
People in line seemed to have developed their own consensus on medical urgency. A woman arrived with an elderly man slumped in a wheelchair and wordlessly pushed him straight past the line and through the fever clinic's doors. No one objected.,排队的人似乎已对就医的紧迫性形成了自己的共识。一名女子带着一名坐轮椅的老人来到这里，一言不发地推着他径直从排队的人身边走过，进了发热门诊的门。没有人阻止他们。
"Across the street, a dozen people waited in another slow-moving line on the sidewalk outside a pharmacy. They included a migrant worker who said he was hoping to buy anything that would relieve his low-grade fever and sore throat.",街对面，一家药店外的人行道上，另一个十几人排出的队伍向前缓缓地移动着。排队者包括一名外来务工者，他说他希望能买到缓解低烧和喉咙痛症状的药，什么药都行。
"The worker, who gave only his surname, Chen, said he was disappointed when he learned from others in the line that the pharmacy was sold out of fever medicine.",这名只自称姓陈的务工者说，他从排队的其他人那里听到药房的退烧药都卖完了时，他感到很失望。
"""I will see what I can get,"" he said. ""If this place has no medicines, other places would not have them either.""","""我看看能买到什么，""他说。""如果这里没有，其他地方也没了。"""
Some residents said that they already had the virus but were not seriously ill.,一些居民说，他们已经感染了病毒，但症状并不严重。
"Hannah Yang, 38, a manager at a film distribution company in Beijing, said more than half of her colleagues had tested positive this week. ""Most of the people feel there's no need to see a doctor,"" she said. ""More people are stockpiling medicine.""","北京一家电影发行公司的经理，现年38岁的汉娜·杨(音)说，她一半以上的同事上周都阳性了。""大多数人觉得没必要去看医生，""她说。""越来越多的人在囤药。"""
"She said that she and her son, an elementary school student, also tested positive on Friday morning. ""I feel nothing,"" Ms. Yang said. ""It seems that the virus is very gentle."" She said that her symptoms were a lot milder than the cold she had three months ago.","她说，她和儿子都在周五早上检测出了阳性，她儿子还是一名小学生。""我没什么感觉，""杨女士说。""看来病毒很温和。""她说，她的症状比三个月前得感冒时轻很多。"
"""I feel there must be many positive cases in Beijing,"" she said. ""No one is seriously fortifying against the virus anymore.""","""我觉得北京肯定有很多阳性病例，""她说。""没人还在那么认真地防御病毒。"""
"Despite the government's reassurances, the abrupt dismantling of three years of bureaucratic machinery to halt the spread of the virus has prompted concern from medical experts outside of mainland China. The experts had been calling instead for China to conduct a six-month vaccination campaign before opening up.",尽管政府作出了保证，但突然废除为遏制病毒传播已建立三年的官僚体系引起了中国大陆以外的医学专家的担忧。 专家们曾一直呼吁中国在开放前开展一次为期六个月的疫苗接种运动。
"A year ago, China was vaccinating more than 20 million people a day. But that effort fizzled out last June, with vaccinations falling to a couple hundred thousand people a day. After pushing residents to have two shots and a booster last year, China has not yet moved on to administering fourth doses. So most of the population has had no recent protection.",一年前，中国每天平均有逾2000万人次接种疫苗。但接种疫苗的努力虎头蛇尾，到去年6月时，每天接种疫苗的人次已下降到几十万。在去年动员接种了两剂疫苗的居民打加强针后，中国一直没有开始接种第四剂疫苗。所以大多数人最近都没有获得免疫保护。
China also has yet to approve mRNA vaccines. Its vaccines rely instead on an older technology that has been proven in other countries to be less effective than mRNA vaccines.,中国也还没有批准mRNA疫苗。国产疫苗用的是一种较为陈旧的技术，其他地方的临床试验已证明国产疫苗不如mRNA疫苗有效。
"Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said that China needed to rapidly increase use of the Chinese vaccines that are available, while also importing mRNA vaccines for the inoculation campaign. And China should buy as much Paxlovid and other oral treatments for coronavirus infections as possible, Professor Jin said.",香港大学病毒学家金冬雁说，中国需要迅速增加现有国产疫苗的使用，同时也需要为开展接种运动进口mRNA疫苗。中国应该购买尽可能多的奈玛特韦和利托那韦以及其他治疗新冠病毒感染的口服药物，金冬雁说。
"But even these steps may now be insufficient. The current wave of cases is spreading so quickly, Professor Jin said, that China should consider putting unvaccinated elderly, who are the most vulnerable, into recently built makeshift hospitals for their own protection. These makeshift hospitals were used until the last few days to isolate Covid patients.",但就算采取了这些步骤，可能还不够。金冬雁表示，当前的感染浪潮蔓延得如此之快，以至于中国应该考虑将最脆弱的未接种疫苗的老年人送进方舱医院保护起来。直到最近几天，这些临时建成的医院曾一直用于隔离新冠病毒感染者。
"Having large numbers of people in China catch Covid at the same time could help the country move past the pandemic swiftly by building up a natural immunity, but it risks causing many deaths, Professor Jin said. Outside China's major cities, the country's health care system is chronically underfunded and short-staffed. A wave of severely ill patients could quickly overwhelm hospitals in small towns that have few if any intensive-care beds.",中国有大批人同时感染新冠病毒，这可能会帮助国人建立自然免疫力，从而迅速度过这场大流行，但也有可能导致许多人死亡，金冬雁说。中国主要城市之外的医疗保健系统长期以来资金不足、人员短缺。一波重病患者可能会让乡镇医院不堪重负，这些医院的重症监护床位很少。
"Asked about the likelihood that 80 or 90 percent of China's population might catch the virus, Professor Jin said: ""That's very probable, and the question is within how long they get it and what's scary is, they don't seem to have a road map.""","当被问及中国80%或90%的人口感染新冠病毒的可能性时，金冬雁说:""很可能发生这种情况。问题是他们会在多近的时间里看到这种情况——可怕的是，他们似乎没有一个路线图。"""
"A day after China's ruling Communist Party announced a broad rollback of the ""zero Covid"" restrictions that had smothered the economy and transformed life in the country, the propaganda apparatus on Thursday began the daunting task of promoting an audacious revision of history.","周四，在执政的中共宣布广泛取消扼杀经济、改变国民日常生活的""新冠清零""限制的第二天，中国的宣传机器开始了一项艰巨任务，那就是推动对历史的大胆修正。"
"While the rest of the world concluded months ago that the coronavirus was becoming less deadly, Beijing presented the development as fresh news to explain its abrupt decision to undo the lockdowns that prompted widespread protests. In doing so, it also made a high-risk bet that vaccination rates in China are sufficient, or soon will be, to prevent a severe outbreak that overwhelms the nation's hospitals.",虽然全世界其他地区在很久之前就已得出新冠病毒致死率正在下降的结论，但北京将这一事态发展当作全新信号，以此解释为何突然取消引发了广泛抗议的封锁措施。此举也意味当局下了一个高风险赌注，即中国的疫苗接种率能达到——或是很快能达到——防止导致全国医院不堪重负水平的严重暴发。
"""The pathogenicity of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus now is significantly reduced,"" Wang Guiqiang, a health expert, told reporters in Beijing at a news briefing on Thursday that was widely covered in state media. ""Everyone should treat it with a normal heart there is no need to be nervous or even fearful.""","""目前新冠病毒奥密克戎毒株的致病力明显下降，""卫生专家王贵强周四在北京的新闻发布会上对记者表示，官方媒体对此进行了广泛报道。""大家还是以平常心对待它，不必要紧张甚至恐惧。"""
"State television also trumpeted assertions that more than 90 percent of cases of the year-old Omicron variant are mild or asymptomatic, without explaining the sudden embrace of such conclusions. The health commission released details on how residents should quarantine at home if they test positive, instead of at hospitals. Workers began tearing down testing booths. Officials detailed new limits on when and how local authorities can impose lockdowns.",国家电视台还大胆断言，对于已经传播一年之久的奥密克戎变异株，九成以上病例都是轻症或无症状感染者，却没有解释突然支持此类结论的理由。卫健委公开宣传居民在测出阳性后应如何在家隔离而不是去医院。工人开始拆除核酸检测点。官员们详细解释了地方政府何时以及如何实施封锁的新规定。
"There were scenes of both relief and confusion over the easing of the lockdowns. Rush-hour traffic returned to Beijing's long empty roads. People posted selfies marking their return to work and to dining at restaurants. But any celebratory mood seemed dampened by worries about getting sick, with people rushing to order home Covid test kits and fever medications.",对于封锁的放松，民众在如释重负的同时也感到困惑。北京空旷已久的马路上，高峰时段又出现了车水马龙的景象。人们纷纷晒出复工和去餐馆吃饭的自拍照。但对生病的担忧似乎浇灭了庆祝的心情，民众纷纷抢购新冠快速检测试剂盒和退烧药。
"Even China's leader, Xi Jinping, seemed to distance himself from the unwinding of his signature policy, traveling to the Gulf for several regional summits one of the few overseas trips he has taken during the pandemic. Mr. Xi's travels were highlighted on the front page of the People's Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, where there was no mention of ""zero Covid"" or its overhaul.","就连中国领导人习近平似乎也与其标志性政策的松动保持了距离，前往海湾地区参加多场地区峰会，而这是他在疫情期间为数不多的海外访问活动。中共喉舌《人民日报》的头版重点报道了习近平的出访，对""新冠清零""及该政策的全面调整只字不提。"
"For months, state media commentaries and experts had played up the threat of Omicron to justify his strict policy of lockdowns, mass quarantines and testing that had disrupted daily life.",数月以来，官媒评论和专家声音一直在渲染奥密克戎的威胁，以证明习近平扰乱日常生活的严厉封锁、大规模隔离和检测政策的合理性。
"""They knew the severity of Omicron, but they did not want to tell people the truth. Instead they started to exaggerate the severity of the disease, the virulence, in order to justify the policy of 'zero Covid,'"" said Yanzhong Huang, a global health specialist and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.","""他们知道奥密克戎的严重程度，但不愿告诉民众真相。相反，他们开始夸大这种疾病的严重性和病毒的致病力，只为证明清零政策的合理性，""全球卫生问题专家、美国外交关系委员会高级研究员黄严忠表示。"
"""Suddenly, you have all these experts coming out to justify why this policy relaxation is necessary,"" he said, referring to health officials whose messages around the pandemic have pivoted drastically in recent days.","""突然之间，所有这些专家又站出来说明为何放松这一政策是必要的，""他说道，指的是卫生官员最近在疫情相关信息上的急剧转向。"
"China's jarring, whiplash-inducing narrative shift around Omicron points to the challenge for the party as it tries to prevent this week's sudden abandoning of ""zero Covid"" from being construed as an admission of failure and a stain on Mr. Xi's legacy. For years, China has pushed a triumphalist narrative about its top-down, heavy-handed approach to eradicating infections, saying that only the Communist Party, under Mr. Xi's leadership, had the will and ability to save lives.","中国关于奥密克戎突如其来的急刹车式叙事转变，说明了中共所面临的挑战，即防止本周突然放弃""新冠清零""的举措被解读为认输，并给习近平的政治遗产留下污点。几年来，中国一直在宣扬采取自上而下的高压手段根除感染的必胜论，称只有习近平领导下的共产党才有意愿和能力拯救生命。"
"The changes the government announced on Wednesday which would limit lockdowns and scrap mass mandatory quarantines and hospitalization for most cases amounted to a reversal of ""zero Covid"" in the face of public opposition and mounting economic costs. But the party is deploying the full force of its propaganda and censorship apparatus to depict the transition as part of the plan all along.","面对公众的反抗和不断加剧的经济代价，政府在周三宣布的调整——限制封控范围并基本取消大规模强制隔离和收治——相当于对""新冠清零""的逆转。但中共正在动用政治宣传和审查机器的全部力量，将这种转变描述为运筹帷幄的规划。"
"More crucially, state media appeared to be distancing the policy shift from Mr. Xi, in stark contrast to the summer of 2020 when they had highlighted Mr. Xi's declaration of victory against Covid when the restrictions curbed infections. Even the term ""zero Covid"" has suddenly disappeared from official statements and officials' remarks.","更为关键的在于，官媒似乎将政策转变与习近平拉开了距离，这与2020年夏天的情况形成鲜明对比，当时封控遏制了感染，官媒都在强调习近平宣布抗击新冠疫情的胜利。现在，连""新冠清零""的说法都突然从官方公告和官员发言中消失。"
"Opening China up to a highly transmissible outbreak is not the success that Beijing had hoped to achieve, said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago. ""They realized that this is not something that is worth celebrating,"" he said. ""Reopening has taken too long, and praising Xi may very well be counterproductive.""","芝加哥大学教授杨大利表示，与高传染性的疫情短兵相接并非北京想要看到的成功。""他们明白这并不值得庆祝，""他说。""重新开放拖得太久，再赞美习近平可能适得其反。"""
"Cases have surged, with the country reporting an average of around 30,000 cases a day in the last week, though with the cutting back of testing, such tallies are expected to soon result in an undercount. International experts have warned that China's strategy of relying heavily on snap lockdowns and contact tracing, at the expense of ramping up vaccinations, has put the country at risk of overwhelming the chronically underfunded and understaffed public health care system. Compared with many other Asian countries, China has fewer intensive care beds per capita.",中国感染数已出现激增，上周平均每天报告约3万例。但随着检测减少，统计数字将很快出现降低。国际专家警告，中国严重依赖快速封锁和密接追踪，未能加快疫苗接种，可能导致长期资金和人力不足的公共医疗系统不堪重负。相较于亚洲许多国家，中国人均重症监护床位较少。
"Images and videos posted on Chinese social media and state media showed the rapid dismantling of the some of the most widely feared or despised features of the ""zero Covid"" controls around the country. Workers carted away signs denoting mass testing sites and ripped down posters that restricted subway use to those who had negative Covid tests. Prefabricated makeshift hospitals, which Beijing had once touted as proof of its ability to mobilize but had quickly become symbols of the state's power to detain citizens, were torn down.","中国社交媒体和官方媒体上发布的图片和视频显示，全国各地""清零""管控措施中一些最令人恐惧或最让人厌恶的手段被迅速解除。工作人员运走了代表大规模检测点的标志物，撕毁了限制新冠检测阴性者乘坐地铁的海报。预制构件的方舱医院被拆除。北京曾将方舱吹捧为其动员能力的证明，但很快就成为了国家扣押公民权力的象征。"
"Internet censors seemed to be trying to tread a delicate line. Xiao Qiang, an expert on censorship at the University of California, Berkeley, said that since the new policy was announced on Wednesday, censors have tried to erase posts and comments that either called for sticking to the stringent ""zero Covid"" measures or supported the complete removal of restrictions.","互联网审查机构似乎在小心翼翼地走钢丝。加州大学伯克利分校研究审查问题的专家萧强表示，自周三宣布新政策以来，审查人员一直试图删除那些呼吁坚持严格""清零""措施或支持完全取消限制的帖子和评论。"
"""The government has indeed turned 180 degrees, but it does not allow the public to call it a complete failure of the previous policy,"" Mr. Xiao said. ""It also wants to basically control the narrative that what the government did was right, and the new policy shift is not directly the result of the protests.""","""实际上已经转向转了180度了，可是它不允许社会的舆论说这是前边的彻底失败，""萧强说。""它还要把它基本上控制在一个前边也是政府做的对，然后现在再出现的新的情况并不直接acknowledge(承认是)这个抗议(的结果)。"""
"For the party, the strategy of playing down the threat of the virus is a gamble because it can be difficult to predict how China will fare as the virus continues to spread unabated. But health officials are worried about a surge in cases overwhelming the country's hospitals, especially after mandating for nearly three years that anyone who tests positive must be admitted.",对中共来说，淡化病毒威胁的策略是一场赌博，因为随着病毒继续有增无减，可能很难预测中国接下来的情况。但卫生官员担心病例的激增会让该国的医院不堪重负，特别是近三年来，所有检测阳性的人都必须入院。
"In a speech reported by the China Youth Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, on Wednesday, a former infectious diseases official predicted that as much as 90 percent of the population could eventually be infected with Covid. Feng Zijian, the former deputy head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said officials must quickly accelerate vaccinations, especially in older people, and prepare the health care system for an influx of patients.",在《中国青年报》周三报道的一篇讲话中，一名前疾控官员预测，多达90%的人口可能最终会感染新冠病毒。前中国疾病预防控制中心副主任冯子健说，官员们必须迅速加快疫苗接种，特别是老年人的疫苗接种，并使医疗系统为大量患者的涌入做好准备。
"Spreading the message that most cases will not require any medical treatment could help hospitals with triage. On Thursday, China's national health commission issued a plan that enabled Chinese to use store-bought rapid-antigen tests instead of relying on the widely criticized government-run P.C.R. tests. Residents who tested positive with self-administered tests could choose to quarantine at home, the plan said.","宣传""大多数病例不需要任何治疗""的信息，可以帮助减轻医院的负担。周四，中国国家卫生健康委员会发布了一份通知，允许中国人使用药店购买的快速抗原检测，而不是依赖由政府管理、广受批评的核酸检测。该计划称，自我检测呈阳性的居民可以选择居家隔离。"
"Many ordinary Chinese appeared to be bracing themselves for a widespread outbreak. On Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform, people shared tips for quarantining at home. Residents began to stockpile drugs and pain killers, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen, apparently driving up prices in stores.",许多普通中国人似乎正在为大规模暴发做准备。在中国流行的社交媒体平台微博上，人们分享了在家隔离的种种技巧。居民们开始囤积药物和止痛药，包括布洛芬和对乙酰氨基酚，这似乎推高了药店的售价。
"At the same time, many Chinese were quick to point out the party's abrupt turnabout in policy. On Weibo, users mocked experts who had been enlisted to justify the central leadership decisions. Foremost among them was Liang Wannian, the chief scientist working with the World Health Organization on studies into the origins of the pandemic. (For months, Mr. Liang talked up the deadliness of the Omicron variant, but told reporters on Wednesday that the virus ""has now become milder."")","与此同时，许多中国人立刻指出了中共政策的突然转变。在微博上，用户嘲笑那些被请来为中央领导决策辩护的专家。其中最重要的是与世界卫生组织合作研究大流行起源的首席科学家梁万年。(几个月来，梁一直在鼓吹奥密克戎变种的致命性，但周三他对记者说，""目前的病毒更加温和了""。)"
"""The people persisted in popularizing science to the experts,"" wrote one widely circulating post on social media. ""The experts finally realized that Covid is less serious than the flu.""","""老百姓坚持不懈地，对专家进行科普，""社交媒体上一个广泛流传的帖子写道。""专家终于明白，新冠比流感还轻。"""
"Hazel Liu, a resident in Beijing who had taken part in a recent protest, saw the easing as evidence that the public pressure campaign had worked. She was glad to see malls in the city lift rules requiring customers to show negative tests before entry. ""I hope I can travel abroad in 2023!"" she added.","参加最近一次抗议活动的北京居民黑兹尔·刘(音)认为，这种放松是公众压力运动奏效的证据。她很高兴看到该市的商场取消了要求顾客在入场前出示核酸阴性检测结果的规定。""2023年我想出国旅游!""她还说。"
"In many ways, the new policy was also a vindication of health experts and others who had previously been silenced, or ignored, for questioning China's zero-tolerance approach.","在很多方面，新政策也证明了卫生专家和其他一些人的正确性，他们此前因质疑中国的""清零""态度而被迫保持沉默或遭到忽视。"
"When Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, described China's ""zero Covid"" policy as unsustainable in May, his comments were censored on the Chinese internet and denounced as ""irresponsible"" by a foreign ministry spokesman.","今年5月，当世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞(Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus)称中国的""清零""政策不可持续时，他的言论在中国互联网上遭到审查，并被外交部发言人谴责为""不负责任""。"
"Chinese social media users shared articles recalling Zhang Wenhong, a epidemiologist in Shanghai and an earlier proponent of easing. Shortly after Shanghai entered a brutal 60-day lockdown in April, Mr. Zhang and other authors published a study on the weakening lethality of the Omicron variant that was widely criticized.",中国社交媒体用户分享了一些文章，回忆起上海流行病学家张文宏，他是放松政策的早期支持者。今年4月，在上海进入为期60天的残酷封锁后不久，张文宏和其他作者发表了一项关于奥密克戎变异株致命性减弱的研究，受到了广泛批评。
"On Thursday, an article titled: ""Mistaken criticisms of Zhang Wenhong and 'living with the virus' cost us a year,"" was shared widely. The article was later removed.",周四，一篇名为《错误批评张文宏和共存论，让我们失去了一年》的文章被广泛转发。这篇文章后来被删除。
"Many Chinese returned to Dr. Li Wenliang, the first victim of censorship involving the pandemic, who died in early 2020 after contracting the coronavirus. Users flocked to Dr. Li's Weibo page to leave heartfelt notes of solidarity. ""Dr. Li, it's finally over."" one user wrote. ""We miss you. Thank you for your hard work.""","许多中国人再次想到了李文亮，他是此次疫情审查的第一个受害者，并在感染新冠病毒后于2020年初去世。微博用户涌到李医生的主页，留下真诚的声援留言。""李医生，结束了。""一名用户写道。""想念您，谢谢你，辛苦了。"""
"The Chinese government on Wednesday unveiled a broad easing of its strict ""zero Covid"" policy, after an extraordinary outburst of discontent in mass street protests a week ago.","在一周前的大规模街头抗议爆发出异常强烈的不满情绪之后，中国政府周三宣布全面放松严格的""新冠清零""政策。"
"The changes do not dismantle the policy, but they represent a loosening of measures that have dragged down the economy by disrupting daily life for hundreds of millions of people, forcing many small businesses to close and sending youth unemployment to a record high.",这些变化并不等于政策的废除，但意味着防疫措施的放松，这些措施拖累了经济，扰乱了数亿人的日常生活，导致许多小企业倒闭，并将青年失业率推至创纪录的高位。
Here are the highlights from the announcement.,以下是政府公告的要点。
Testing,检测
"The new rules move China away from the use of P.C.R. tests and digital passes used to indicate possible exposure to the virus. Mass testing will no longer be conducted in areas that are not considered ""high risk,"" a designation for regions that have positive cases. The high-risk category is now limited to buildings, units, floors or households, rather than encompassing neighborhoods.","新规要求中国不再靠核酸检测和数字通行证来验证是否暴露于病毒。非""高风险""地区——也就是出现多例阳性病例的地区——不再进行大规模检测。高风险的划定只能限于楼栋、单元、楼层和住户，不得扩大到社区。"
P.C.R. tests and health codes will no longer be checked for travel between regions in China.,国内跨区域流动不再查验核酸检测阴性证明和健康码。
Hospitalization and Quarantine,收治与隔离
"In a departure from the unpopular rule that forced many infected people to stay in makeshift isolation facilities and hospitals, those who are infected with mild symptoms are now free to isolate at home. Close contacts are also allowed to quarantine at home, and will be released with a negative test on the fifth day.",与此前迫使许多感染者留在方舱和医院的不得人心的规定不同，轻症现在可以居家隔离。密切接触者也可以居家隔离，到第五天核酸检测阴性后解除隔离。
"The authorities had adjusted some of these rules in early November, when they lifted stay-at-home orders for contacts of close contacts, which left tens of millions of people confined to their homes.",当局在11月初曾对部分规定进行了调整，当时取消了让次密接居家隔离的命令，这一规定曾导致无数人被困家中。
Lockdowns,封锁
"The measures circumscribe the power of local officials to impose lockdowns and ensure they are lifted quickly. Local authorities may still lock down buildings in the event that a positive case is detected, but they cannot restrict movement and suspend business operations in regions outside a specified ""high risk"" designation. For ""high-risk"" areas, the guidelines mandate lockdowns to be lifted if no new positive cases are detected for five consecutive days.",新措施限制了地方官员实施封锁的权力，并要求及时解封。地方当局仍可以在发现阳性病例后封锁楼栋，但不得限制高风险地区以外的人员流动和商业经营。该指导方针规定，连续五天没有新增感染者的高风险区必须解封。
"In locked down areas, the authorities are strictly prevented from blocking fire escapes and public exits, a possible concession to recent protesters. Blocked exits were widely discussed as a principal cause of excess deaths during a building fire in the western region of Xinjiang, a disaster that laid the groundwork for mass unrest in over two dozens cities last week.",对于封锁的区域，当局严禁封堵消防通道和公共出口，这可能是对最近抗议者的让步。很多人认为，出口遭到封锁是新疆一起公寓火灾死亡人数过多的主要原因，这场灾难是上周二十多座城市出现大规模骚乱的导火索。
Vaccinations,疫苗接种
The government reiterated its pledge to do more to increase the vaccination rate of older people. But the new rules left unanswered questions about how officials will try to contain the inevitable wave of infections. The Communist Party has accelerated its vaccination campaign in recent days by approving several new Chinese-made vaccines and publishing interviews with experts who try to allay fears of the health risks from getting a shot.,政府重申其承诺，要加快推进老年人的疫苗接种。但这些新规留下了一些悬而未决的问题，即官员将如何遏制不可避免的感染浪潮。最近几天，中国加快了疫苗接种工作，批准了几款中国制造的新疫苗，并公布了对专家的采访，试图缓解民众对接种疫苗会引发健康风险的担忧。
"But those defenses may not come in time. Even if China moves swiftly to boost its vulnerable populations, like older adults, it needs a few months for the protection to kick in, said Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. China's domestic vaccines also are typically weaker than shots based on the newer mRNA technology, and experts generally agree that a third shot is necessary to prevent severe illness.",但这些防护措施可能为时已晚。香港大学病毒学家薛达(Siddharth Sridhar)表示，即使中国迅速为老年人等易感群体的免疫，保护屏障可能也需要几个月时间才能发挥作用。国产疫苗效率通常也要弱于基于更新的mRNA技术的疫苗，专家们普遍认为，预防重症必须要打第三针。
"In the meantime, nonmedical interventions, including social distancing, quarantine and home isolation, are not enough to prevent large scale outbreaks, he said.",他说除此之外，保持社交距离、隔离和居家等非医疗干预措施不足以防止大规模的疫情暴发。
"""It's fine to have a major outbreak at some point, if you're well prepared,"" Dr. Sridhar said.","""如果做好了充足准备，在某个时候让疫情大规模暴发是没问题的，""薛达博士说。"
"For China, this would mean booster shots for the elderly, enough Covid pills like Paxlovid stockpiled in hospitals around the country to help deal with severe Covid cases and enough hospital beds with ventilators.",在中国，这意味着要为老年人接种加强针，让全国各地的医院储备充足的新冠药品(如奈玛特韦/利托那韦组合)以救治新冠重症，还要有足够配备了呼吸机的床位。
"""If they are considering a pivot, they need to bolster their defenses because a storm is coming,"" Dr. Sridhar said.","""如果他们在考虑政策转向，就得加强防御，因为风暴即将来临，""薛达博士说。"
"Over the past three years, China's top leader, Xi Jinping, staked his legitimacy on ""zero Covid,"" making it an ideological campaign aimed at demonstrating the superiority of centralized control over democratic rule. He declared a ""people's war"" against the coronavirus that used lockdowns and quarantines to eliminate infections.","中国最高领导人习近平在过去三年里曾将政府的合法性押在""新冠清零""上，让清零成了一场旨在展示集权控制优于民主制度的意识形态运动。他把遏制新冠病毒的努力称为一场""人民战争""，为消除感染使用了大范围封控和集中隔离等做法。"
"In a remarkable pivot, the Chinese government announced a broad easing of those rules on Wednesday, an implicit concession to public discontent after mass street protests in late November posed the most widespread challenge to the ruling Communist Party in decades.",周三，中国政府来了个引人注目的大转弯，宣布大范围放松防控规定，这是今年11月底全国各地爆发了集体抗议活动，给执政的中共带来了几十年来最大范围的挑战后，政府对公众不满做出的不直接言明的让步。
"The party appears to be attempting a tactical, face-saving retreat that would allow Mr. Xi to change tack without acknowledging that widespread opposition and economic pain forced his hand. China's state media depicted Wednesday's move as a planned transition after Mr. Xi's zero-tolerance approach secured a victory over a virus that has now weakened.",中共看来是在尝试一种保全面子的战术退缩，让习近平无需承认，是广泛的反对和经济的痛苦迫使他改变了做法。中国官媒把周三的举动描述为一个有计划的过渡，称习近平此前的新冠清零措施确保了战胜现已减弱的病毒。
"The move could very well assuage protesters. But the party is expected to confront a surge of infections as lockdowns lift, schools reopen and people try to resume normal life. The government must now place much greater urgency on vaccinations, which had been neglected in recent months, experts say.",此举能很好地安抚抗议者。但随着放松防控、学校复课、人们试图恢复正常生活，估计中共会面临感染激增的情况。专家们说，政府现在必须加大疫苗接种的紧迫性，这项工作曾在最近几个月里被忽视。
"The new policy takes aim at some of the most onerous and widely feared pandemic measures that reflect how intrusive the policy had become. Beijing largely did away on Wednesday with rules requiring mass testing, limited the scope of lockdowns and scrapped mandatory hospitalization and mass quarantines. It also ordered pharmacies not to ban or control the sale of cold and flu medication a policy enforced in some places to prevent residents from using over-the-counter drugs to reduce fevers and avoid detection.",新政策针对的是一些最麻烦、人们普遍惧怕的防疫措施，这些措施反映了清零政策的侵入性。中国政府周三基本上取消了全员核酸检测的要求，对封控范围进行了限制，并取消了强制住院和送往集中隔离设施的规定。政府还下令不得禁止药店出售缓解感冒和流感症状的药物，一些地方曾禁止药店出售这类药物，以防止居民擅自使用非处方药退烧，以免被发现感染。
"The changes, while not a complete dismantling of ""zero Covid,"" loosen measures that have dragged down the economy by disrupting daily life for hundreds of millions of people, forcing many small businesses to shutter and driving youth unemployment to a record high. The changes also attempt to alleviate public anger against the system of digital surveillance used to track and limit the movements of practically all people.","尽管并没有彻底取消""新冠清零""政策，但这些变化放松了拖累经济的防控措施，这些措施已扰乱数亿人的日常生活，迫使许多小企业倒闭，将年轻人失业率推到了历史最高水平。这些变化也在试图减轻公众的愤怒，许多人对用于追踪密接、限制几乎所有人行动的数字监控系统很反感。"
"Under ""zero Covid,"" dozens of officials have been punished or fired after outbreaks. Cities have imposed lockdowns that confined hundreds of millions of people in their homes for weeks or even months at a time. Citizens and health experts who questioned the extent of controls or problems with lockdowns were punished or silenced.","在""新冠清零""政策下，已有几十名官员在疫情暴发后受到处罚或免职。许多城市都曾采取将上亿人限制在家中数周甚至数月的封控措施。对封控范围或封控中出现的问题提出质疑的公民和卫生专家曾受到惩罚或被噤声。"
"The controls have become harder to justify as rapidly spreading Omicron variants continued to slip through, and especially as the rest of the world has increasingly adjusted to living with the virus. The protests in late November hurt Mr. Xi's standing as a leader and his rhetoric that the policy enjoyed broad support and was necessary to improve people's lives.",证明严厉防控措施的正确性已变得越来越难，因为这些措施不能阻止感染力强的奥密克戎变异株的继续传播，而世界其他地方也在越来越适应与病毒共存的生活。今年11月下旬的抗议活动损害了习近平的领导地位，也损害了他的说法，他曾称清零政策得到了广泛的支持，对于改善人民的生活必不可少。
"""By now, Xi Jinping should also understand that this virus can't be controlled, and if it can't be controlled, then opening up must happen sooner or later,"" said Deng Yuwen, a former editor at a Communist Party newspaper, the Study Times, who now lives in the United States and writes commentaries about Chinese politics. ""But most fundamental of all, the economy can't hold up any longer. If they try tightening up again, the ordinary people would really raise hell.""","""习近平到现在也该明白了，这个病毒是无法控制的，既然无法控制，那么开放是迟早要发生的事情，""曾在中共刊物《学习时报》担任编辑的邓聿文说，他现居美国，撰写有关中国政治的评论。""但最重要的是，经济已无法支撑下去。如果他们再次收紧的话，普通老百姓真的会闹翻天的。"""
"For many in China, the relief was immediate. People flocked to Chinese social media and video sites to post thumbs-up emojis and comments like: ""I'm crying, I've waited for three years.""","对许多国内的人来说，放松管控让他们立刻得到了解脱。 人们涌向中国的社交媒体和视频网站，发表示""赞""的表情符和评论，例如:""哭了，我等了三年了。"""
"One migrant worker who had protested against a lockdown last month at an iPhone manufacturing complex in central China said he was elated by the news. ""Our voices are finally heard,"" said the worker, who gave only his last name, Zhang, out of fear of retaliation by the authorities. ""We workers no longer have to be locked up, starved and suppressed.""","一名曾在上个月参加抗议活动，反对中国郑州的iPhone生产基地封控厂区的外来务工者表示，放松防控的消息让他欢欣鼓舞。""我们的声音终于被听到了，""这名工人说道。由于害怕当局报复，他只告诉记者自己姓张。""我们工人不用再被封、挨饿受压迫了。"""
"Far from indicating defeat in the face of broad opposition, China's state media has depicted Wednesday's turn in policy as the latest in an unbroken succession of wise choices that have resulted in a hard-earned victory for China. ""In the past three years, the virus has weakened, and we have become stronger,"" the official Xinhua news agency wrote in a commentary Wednesday titled ""Winning the Strategic Initiative Through Persistence.""","中国官媒并没有在大范围的反对面前承认失败，而是将周三的政策大转弯说成政府连续做出的明智选择中的最新一个，这些选择让中国取得了来之不易的胜利。""近三年来，病毒弱了，我们强了，""官媒新华社在周三发表的题为《在坚持中赢得战略主动》的评论中写道。"
"For days, the propaganda apparatus has been pushing the idea long understood elsewhere that Omicron variants are less lethal than the coronavirus's earlier iterations. Officials and state media reports have quietly dropped the use of ""dynamic zero Covid,"" Beijing's term for the strategy of lockdowns and quarantines to clear infections.","连日来，宣传机器一直在鼓吹奥密克戎变异株的致死率低于新冠病毒早期变异株的说法，这是世界其他地方早已接受的事实。官员和官媒报道已悄悄放弃了""动态清零""的说法，那是政府用来描述以封控和集中隔离手段清除病毒感染的术语。"
"The media blitz showed how the party can shift gears by using its propaganda to obfuscate what were policy mistakes, said Willy Lam, a longtime analyst of Chinese politics in Hong Kong who is a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation.",长期在香港研究中国政治的分析师、詹姆斯敦基金会高级研究员林和立表示，官媒铺天盖地的宣传显示出中共如何通过宣传来掩盖政策错误，从而改变方向。
"Mr. Xi ""may still insist that he was right with 'zero Covid' but by force of circumstances he has no choice,"" said Mr. Lam, referring to the recent protests and the reeling economy.","林和立说，习近平""也许仍坚持认为'清零'是正确的，但迫于形势别无选择""，他指的是最近的抗议活动和不景气的经济。"
"""They're now trying to cover up the mistakes they had made by finally telling the truth to the public that the Omicron variant is not life-threatening,"" he added.","""他们现在正试图掩盖他们所犯的错误，最终向公众说出奥密克戎变异株不危及生命的实情，""林和立补充道。"
"The protests showed how drastically ""zero Covid"" had undermined the party's public support. For many, the expansive and often seemingly arbitrary pandemic measures became the clearest example of the excesses of Mr. Xi's authoritarian tendencies, and opposition to the approach unexpectedly resonated with people across the country.","抗议活动表明，""新冠清零""严重损害了公众对中共的支持。对许多人来说，采取大范围、且往往看似武断的防控措施，已成为习近平的威权主义倾向过度的最明显例子，反对清零的呼声出人意料地引起了全国各地人民的共鸣。"
"More important, the economic slowdown caused by ""zero Covid"" undermined a key tenet of the party's rule, that in exchange for democratic freedoms, the people would enjoy steady economic growth and the chance at a better life. The heavy reliance on mass testing and quarantines also placed an immense financial burden on local governments. The policy has relied heavily on mass P.C.R. testing and quarantines in makeshift hospitals and newly built facilities to house people deemed close contacts. As outbreaks grew, so did the costs.","更重要的是，""新冠清零""造成的经济放缓损害了中共执政的一个关键信条，那就是人民为换取经济稳定增长、过上更好生活的机会而放弃民主自由。对全员核酸检测和大规模集中隔离的严重依赖也给地方政府带来了巨大的财务负担。清零政策在很大程度上依赖全员核酸检测，以及用临时搭建的方舱医院和隔离设施对密接进行集中隔离。但随着感染病例的增加，相关费用也越来越高。"
"""Economically speaking, they can't sustain this,"" Mr. Deng said. ""Even if local governments want to lock down like before, they just don't have the money. Then on top of that, there's been the student and public protests, so it's like the donkey has finished working the grindstone and can be slaughtered it's time to open up.""","""从经济上讲，他们撑不住了，""邓聿文说。""就算地方政府想像以前那样封控的话，他们也没钱了。再加上还发生了学生和公众的抗议，所以这有点像卸磨杀驴，是开放的时候了。"""
"The central government's announcement came after a series of moves over the last several days by local governments, particularly in major cities, to ease regulations. Shanghai said that it would no longer require residents to show a negative P.C.R. test to ride the subway or buses or to enter outdoor parks. Beijing dropped a similar requirement this week for access to the city's main airport, as well as supermarkets, shopping centers and other public places.",中央政府宣布新动作之前的几天里，一些地方政府，尤其是大城市政府，采取了一系列放松防控的做法。上海已表示，不再要求居民乘坐地铁或公共汽车、或进入室外公园时，出示核酸阴性证明。北京也在本周取消了对人员进入主要机场以及超市、购物中心和其他公共场所的类似要求。
"Wednesday's changes will free residents in many parts of the country from what had become a near-daily chore of getting tested just to travel across the country, move around their cities or use public services. The new policy did not immediately change the rules for international arrivals, who are subject to at least five days in government-designated quarantine.",周三的变化将让国内许多地方的民众从几乎每天的核酸检测中解放出来，此前，如果想在所住城市走动、使用公共服务，或去国内其他地方旅行的话，民众必须做核酸检测。新政策没有马上改变对国际入境者的规定，从国外入境的人仍需要在政府指定酒店接受至少五天的隔离。
"People who have mild or asymptomatic Covid will be allowed to isolate at home and no longer be sent to hospitals, as had been the case since the virus emerged. The government appeared to retain the power to impose lockdowns, but narrowed the scope of such measures to buildings, floors or units rather than neighborhoods, districts or cities and said that such confinements should be lifted quickly.",新规定让症状轻或无症状的新冠病毒感染者可在家隔离，不再像自疫情暴发以来那样被送往医院。政府看来保留了进行封控的权力，但将封控的范围缩小到楼栋、楼层或单元，而不是整个社区、地区或城市，新规定还说封控应该快封快解。
"At the same time, the policy shift will bring new challenges for the party. Experts have warned that China needs to step up sharply its pace of vaccinations, particularly for older adults, before taking big strides to reopen the country. People over 80, who are among the most vulnerable to serious illness or death during a Covid infection, have the lowest rate of vaccination: only two-thirds have received the initial course of vaccination, usually two shots, and only two-fifths have had the initial course of vaccines plus a booster.",与此同时，政策的转变也将给中共带来了新的挑战。专家们警告，在大步走向国家重新开放之前，中国需要大幅加快疫苗接种工作，尤其是老年人的疫苗接种。80岁及以上的人感染新冠病毒后最易患重病或死亡，国内这个年龄段的人疫苗接种率最低:只有三分之二的人完成了通常是两针的初始疫苗接种，只有40%的人打过两针疫苗后打了加强针。
"""The timing is clearly because of the economic and social difficulties faced during 'zero Covid,' but it's happening as we head into the cold winter months,"" said Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. Even if China moves at lightning speed to boost its vulnerable populations, it will need a few months to vaccinate the numbers needed for reopening.","""在这个时间放松显然是因为'新冠清零'期间面临的经济和社会困难，但这也发生在我们进入寒冷的冬季月份之际，""香港大学病毒学家薛达(Siddharth Sridhar)说。即使中国能以闪电般的速度增加脆弱人口的抵抗力，也需要几个月的时间才能完成重新开放所需的疫苗接种工作。"
"""If they are considering a pivot, they need to bolster their defenses because a storm is coming,"" Dr. Sridhar said.","""如果他们正在考虑转弯的话，他们需要加强预防，因为风暴即将来临，""薛达说。"
"The easing of the rules appeared to unleash pent-up demand for travel after months of being told to forgo sightseeing and family reunions and stay in place. Ctrip, a Chinese travel booking site, said that searches for air tickets had more than doubled on the platform. Demand was especially strong for travel before next month's Lunar New Year holiday.",好几个月来，政府一直劝告人们放弃旅游、不搞家庭团聚、不离开住地，放宽管控的宣布看来释放了被压抑的旅行需求。中国的旅游预订网站携程表示，在其平台上搜索机票的数量增加了一倍多。对下个月的农历新年假期前的旅行需求尤为强劲。
"At the same time, many older people in China have been concerned that opening up too quickly might expose them to dangerous infections, a sign of the public relations challenge lying ahead for Beijing.",与此同时，许多中国老年人担心，过快开放可能会让他们遭遇感染的危险，表明了政府在将来面临的公关挑战。
"Du Weilin, a 72-year-old Shanghai resident sitting on a roadside bench on Wednesday, said he was worried about what the new policy might mean for him. ""The virus needs to be strictly controlled, and now is not the time to open up,"" he said, adding that the only time to do so would be if there were zero cases.","周三，现年72岁的上海居民杜维林(音)坐在路边的长椅上接受采访时说，他担心新政策对自己的影响。"" 病毒应该要严控，现在还不是放开的时候，""他说。他还说，只有在零感染的情况下才能开放。"
"Mr. Du said that he had not been vaccinated because he did not believe the available vaccines to be effective. ""Only your own immune system works,"" he said. ""Everything should be taken one step at a time.""","杜先生说，他还没有接种疫苗，因为他不相信现有疫苗的有效性。""只有你的免疫系统有用，""他说。"" 放开的话可能造成扩散，还是要严控，要慢慢来。"""
"China's top leader, Xi Jinping, heaped praise on the late former president, Jiang Zemin, on Tuesday in a show of unity among the ruling elite just over a week after nationwide protests challenged Beijing's authority.",中国最高领导人习近平在周二的追悼会上高度赞扬了已故前国家主席江泽民，以展示统治精英的团结。就在一周多前，全国各地曾爆发挑战北京权威的抗议活动。
"Despite its atheism, the ruling Chinese Communist Party sends off its deceased leaders with a near-religious solemnity, and its ceremony to commemorate Mr. Jiang, who died Wednesday at 96, was no exception. Mr. Xi delivered a 51-minute eulogy for Mr. Jiang that was full of accolades while avoiding hints of any personal and political differences between the two leaders.",尽管宣扬无神论，但执政的中共总是以近乎宗教般的庄严送别已故领导人，江泽民的追悼会也不例外，他于上周三去世，享年96岁。习近平在江泽民追悼会上致了长达51分钟的悼词，悼词中充满了赞誉，同时避免了有关这两名最高领导人之间存在任何个人和政治分歧的暗示。
"""We love and esteem Comrade Jiang Zemin and cherish the memory of Comrade Jiang Zemin, because he devoted his heart and soul and his energies all his life to the Chinese people,"" Mr. Xi said at a memorial ceremony in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.","""我们爱戴江泽民同志，怀念江泽民同志，是因为他把毕生心血和精力都献给了中国人民，""习近平在北京人民大会堂举行的追悼会上说。"
"The event was attended by thousands of officials, soldiers and dignitaries, who sat in the audience, wearing masks. Even as the party sought to demonstrate solidarity within its ranks, the masks were a visual reminder of the coronavirus pandemic controls that prompted protests across China.",数千名党政军要员参加了追悼会，他们戴着口罩坐在会场里。就在中共寻求展示内部团结的时候，这些口罩给了人们一个视觉上的提醒:正是遏制新冠病毒大流行的防控措施引发了中国各地的抗议活动。
"The demonstrations against China's exceptionally stringent ""zero Covid"" policy of lockdowns erupted across the country in late November, sometimes escalating into calls for Mr. Xi and the party to step down. The Chinese government has started easing some of the pandemic measures that fanned public anger, even as coronavirus infections keep rising. Beijing said on Tuesday that it would no longer require residents to show negative Covid test results to enter supermarkets, shopping centers, the city's main airport and other public places.","今年11月下旬，全国各地爆发示威活动，反对中国异常严格的""新冠清零""防控政策，个别抗议者甚至喊出了要求习近平和中共下台的口号。就在新冠病毒感染病例仍在继续上升的时候，中国政府已开始放宽一些激起公众愤怒的防控措施。北京市周二宣布，民众进入商超、购物中心和各类公共场所以及主要机场时，不再需要出示核酸检测阴性证明。"
"The protests were the most widespread and boldest in China since 1989, and especially an affront for Mr. Xi, who has tightened the party's grip over society and gone to great lengths to quash dissent in his first decade in power.","反对""清零""的示威是中国自1989年以来发生的范围最广、最大胆的抗议活动，对习近平来说尤其是一种冒犯，他已在执政的头十年里加强了中共对社会的控制，并不遗余力地镇压异见。"
"At this delicate time, the funerary events for Mr. Jiang also gave Mr. Xi a chance to press the leadership and the country to rally around himself, analysts of Chinese politics said.",中国政治分析人士表示，在这个微妙时刻为江泽民举行追悼会也给了习近平一个机会，使得他能向领导层和全国施压，让他们团结在自己周围。
"Many of the rituals to mark former Chinese leaders' deaths are prescribed in rules developed over decades in marking the passing of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and other party titans.",为中国已故领导人办丧事的规矩是几十年来形成的，是在为毛泽东、邓小平和党内其他重要人物办理后事的基础上制定的。
"But the tributes for Mr. Jiang were by some measures similar to those for Deng, one of the founding revolutionaries of Communist China and a much more weighty figure in Chinese history, said Deng Yuwen, a former editor at a Communist Party newspaper who now lives in the United States. Mr. Xi's eulogy on Tuesday was about as long as the eulogy that Mr. Jiang delivered for Deng Xiaoping when he died in 1997.",但在某种程度上，江泽民的追悼会与邓小平的有相似之处，邓小平是中共元老和开国元勋之一。现旅居美国的中共报纸前编辑邓聿文表示，邓小平在中国历史上的地位要高得多。习近平周二为江泽民致的悼词与邓小平1997年去世后江泽民为邓小平致的悼词长度差不多。
"""With Jiang's passing, it was a given that he'd receive high honors, but I guess that the level of it was a surprise to many people,"" Mr. Deng said in a telephone interview. ""In a sense, this is also hinting that outsiders who take to the streets will not have an opportunity to split the party leadership.""","""江走了之后，肯定要给他很高的礼遇，但是这个地步我估计超出了很多人的预料，""邓聿文在接受电话采访时说。""在某种意义上，这也是暗示外人上街不会有机会来分裂党领导。"""
"The mourning for Mr. Jiang also implicitly signified the end of an era in Chinese politics when he and other party elders remained, even in retirement, powerful back-room players.",江泽民的丧事也暗中标志着中国一个政治时代的结束。在那个时代，即使在退休后，江泽民和其他党内元老也保留着密室操纵的大权。
"After Mr. Jiang relinquished his last major post, as the party's military chairman, in 2004, his proteges perpetuated his influence on politics. Sometimes called the ""Shanghai gang"" after Mr. Jiang's longtime base, they constrained his successor Hu Jintao, and helped Mr. Xi to emerge as Mr. Hu's successor, many experts and insiders say.","江泽民在2004年辞去了他的最后一个重要职位——中央军委主席，他提携的官员让他在政治上的影响持续下去。许多专家和内部人士说，这些有时被称为""上海帮""(上海是江泽民长期的大本营)的官员约束了江泽民的继任者胡锦涛，对习近平成为胡锦涛的继任者有所帮助。"
"But Mr. Jiang's influence waned over the past decade, and after Mr. Hu retired in 2012, he, too, retained little sway. At a party congress in October, Mr. Xi swept aside Mr. Hu's remaining proteges, including Premier Li Keqiang, and installed a new top leadership entirely dominated his own loyalists.",但江泽民的影响力已在过去的十年里减弱，胡锦涛在2012年退休后也没有为自己保留多少影响力。在今年10月召开的二十大上，习近平扫除了胡锦涛提拔上来的官员，包括总理李克强，并把新的最高领导层全部换成了自己的亲信。
"""Jiang Zemin's passing signifies that this old-man politics is completely over,"" Mr. Deng said. ""It was over before now, but his passing is an even more powerful symbol of that.""","""江泽民走了就表示这个老人政治彻底地终结了，""邓聿文说。""本来已经终结了，但是现在江走了就是一个更强烈的象征。"""
"The carefully planned rituals began as soon as state media announced Mr. Jiang's death last week. Xinhua, the main official news agency, issued a glowing tribute to Mr. Jiang. Chinese news websites and major newspapers switched their color to a mournful monochrome. In Shanghai, where Mr. Jiang died, a motorcade escorted his body to an airport, where it was flown to Beijing.",在官媒上周宣布江泽民逝世后，精心安排的后事马上就开始了。主要的官方通讯社新华社发表了高度赞扬江泽民的文章。国内的网站和主要报纸都把彩色页面换成了表示悲伤的黑白色。在江泽民逝世的上海，他的遗体由一个车队护送到机场，然后运往北京。
"Since then, party newspapers have published tributes to Mr. Jiang. They have highlighted his role in shoring up the party after the military crushed pro-democracy protests based at Tiananmen Square in 1989. They praised Mr. Jiang for pressing ahead with China's market-driven reforms and with accelerating the modernization of the military.",那之后，中共的报纸纷纷发表悼念江泽民的文章。这些文章强调了1989年军队镇压天安门广场的民主抗议活动后，江泽民在稳住中共统治方面起到的作用，赞扬他为推进中国经济市场化改革、加快军队现代化建设所做的贡献。
"The mourning culminated on Monday with a funeral attended by the leaders and Mr. Jiang's family. Chinese state television showed Mr. Xi and other officials retired and current walking in a slow, reverent circle around Mr. Jiang's open cask, offering condolences to Mr. Jiang's widow, Wang Yeping, and bowing three times in front of his body.",悼念活动在周一达到高潮，国家领导人和江泽民的家人前往医院向江泽民的遗体告别。国家电视台播放了习近平和其他官员(包括退休和现任官员)庄严缓慢地绕着江泽民的遗体一周，在遗体前三鞠躬，并向江泽民的遗孀王冶坪致哀的画面。
"Mr. Hu, the retired leader, also circled the casket, accompanied by an aide who steadied him. At the party congress in October, Mr. Hu was abruptly escorted off the stage an exit that set off wild speculation that Mr. Xi was purging the former leader in a dramatic display of his power. (Chinese state media later reported that Mr. Hu was unwell.)",已退休的领导人胡锦涛也参加了这个活动，一名助手扶着他绕遗体一周。在今年10月召开的二十大上，胡锦涛突然被带离主席台，引发了人们的疯狂猜测，有说法称，习近平清洗了这名前领导人，引人注目地展示了自己的权力。(中国官媒后来的报道称胡锦涛身体不适。)
"Later on Monday, soldiers and carefully controlled crowds wearing black lined the boulevard on which the hearse carrying Mr. Jiang's body drove to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in western Beijing.",周一晚些时候，军人以及受到严格控制、身穿黑衣的人群，站在通往北京西郊八宝山革命公墓的道路两旁，为江泽民的灵车送行。
"For many Chinese, the sadness at Mr. Jiang's death was heartfelt.",对许多中国人来说，他们对江泽民去世的悲痛是发自内心的。
"Mr. Jiang was at times a hard-line leader, especially when he launched a crackdown in 1999 on the Falun Gong, a spiritual movement that the party saw as a threat to its power. But many in China, especially entrepreneurs and liberal intellectuals, remember him more for pressing forward with market changes, securing China's entry into the World Trade Organization and tolerating more open debate about political change than is possible now.",江泽民有时也很强硬，尤其是1999年对法轮功的镇压，中共认为法轮功对权力构成了威胁。但许多中国人，尤其是企业家和自由派知识分子，对江泽民的回忆更多是他推动了市场化改革，让中国获得了世界贸易组织成员国的地位，以及容忍对政治改革进行更公开的辩论，这在现在已不可能。
"""In his appreciation for reform and opening up, his determination to keep up with the tide of the times, his well-honed political skills and tactics, and his respect for the trend toward greater social diversity and the way he brought all these factors together he surpassed his predecessors,"" said Xiao Gongqin, a historian in Shanghai who recalled meeting Mr. Jiang in 1987.","""他的改革开放意识，顺应时代潮流的决心，成熟的政治技巧和策略，对社会多元化趋势的尊重，以及把这些因素结合起来的本事，都是超过他的前任的，""上海的历史学家萧功勤说，他回忆了自己1987年与江泽民见面的情景。"
"Mr. Xi, in his eulogy, sought to praise Mr. Jiang's achievements without letting them undercut his own record.",习近平寻求在悼词中赞扬江泽民成就，同时也不让这些成就削弱自己的政绩。
"Party leaders remember that in 1989 student protesters galvanized to mourn the sudden death of Hu Yaobang, an ousted party general secretary, who the protesters said had been unfairly treated by Deng Xiaoping and other elders.",中共领导人都记得，1989年的学生抗议运动是在哀悼胡耀邦的突然去世时爆发的，胡耀邦曾任中共中央总书记，后来被罢免，抗议者认为邓小平和其他党内元老对胡耀邦不公。
"Mr. Xi seemed determined to allow no suspicions that he had disrespected Mr. Jiang, but he also presented Mr. Jiang as a forerunner of many of Mr. Xi's own policies to strengthen China against external and domestic threats.",虽然习近平似乎决意不让人们怀疑他对江泽民有任何不尊重，但他也把江泽民描述为自己许多旨在加强中国抵御国内外威胁政策的先行者。
"In the early 1990s, ""world socialism suffered serious setbacks, and some Western countries imposed so-called 'sanctions' on China,"" Mr. Xi said. Mr. Jiang, he continued, had managed to steady the economy while reinforcing ideological discipline, and ""resolutely defending our country's independence, dignity, security and stability.""","20世纪90年代初，""世界社会主义出现严重曲折，一些西方国家对中国进行所谓'制裁'，""习近平说道。他接着表示，江泽民在保证经济稳定发展的同时，加强了意识形态纪律，""坚决维护国家的独立、尊严、安全、稳定。"""
"Mr. Xi also praised Mr. Jiang for stepping down from his last major post in 2004, after 15 years as a central leader, saying that the move showed the late president's ""wise foresight.""","习近平还称赞江泽民在担任了中央领导人15年后，于2004年辞去了自己的最后一个重要职位，称其显示了这位已故国家主席的""深谋远虑""。"
"But Mr. Xi, 69, seems unlikely to follow Mr. Jiang's example. After a decade in power, he has started a third five-year term as party leader, and has no likely successor waiting in the wings, implying he could stay on for at least another decade.",但现年69岁的习近平似乎不太可能以江泽民为榜样。习近平在掌权十年后开始了自己作为中共总书记的第三个五年任期，而且尚未安排可能的继任者，这意味着他可能会再掌权十年。
"In central China, students chanted demands for more transparency about Covid rules, while avoiding the bold slogans that riled the Communist Party a week earlier. In Shanghai, residents successfully negotiated with the local authorities to stop a lockdown of their neighborhood. And despite pressure from officials, a team of volunteer lawyers across China, committed to defending the right of citizens to voice their views, fielded anxious calls from protesters.",在中国中部，学生们大声要求防疫政策公开透明，同时避免喊出一周前激怒中共的大胆口号。在上海，居民与地方当局协商成功，使小区免遭封锁。尽管受到官方压力，中国各地一群仍致力于捍卫公民发声权利的律师志愿者依然会接听抗议者焦虑的来电。
"The recent wave of demonstrations that washed over China was prompted by frustration about pandemic restrictions, but the unrest also sometimes resulted in calls for China's leader, Xi Jinping, to resign. Since then, the police have been out in force to prevent a resurgence, and the mass protests have subsided. In the aftermath, a low-key hum of resistance against the authorities has persisted, suggesting that the big rallies emboldened a small but significant number of people, including students, professionals and blue-collar workers.",由于民众不满防疫措施，最近示威浪潮席卷中国，但有时骚乱中也会出现要求中国领导人习近平下台的呼声。自那以后，警方出动大量警力防止抗议活动卷土重来，大规模抗议逐渐平息。此后，反对当局的低调抗议依然存在，这表明大型集会鼓舞了规模不大但人数依然可观的民众，其中包括学生、专业人士和蓝领工人在内。
"None of those local acts amount to a major challenge to Mr. Xi and the Communist Party. But they suggest that residents are less afraid of challenging officialdom, albeit in more measured, tactical ways. They often invoke China's own laws and policy pledges, an approach that is less likely to draw the wrath of Communist Party leaders.",对习近平和中共来说，这些局部抗议都构不成重大挑战。但它们表明民众不再那么害怕挑战官员，尽管是以更加谨慎、更有策略的方式。他们经常以中国的法律和政策承诺为武器，这种做法不太可能招致中共领导人的怒火。
"""There are people yelling out demands that are also my own, and I'm extremely grateful grateful that they were able to speak out for me,"" said Wang Shengsheng, a lawyer in Zhengzhou, central China. Ms. Wang helped compile a list of more than a dozen lawyers available to give free advice by phone to people in Shanghai and elsewhere worried about repercussions from taking part in vigils and protests.","""有人喊出来我的诉求，我就非常感激，非常感谢他们能够出来替我说话，""中国中部城市郑州的律师王胜生说。她帮助编制了一份包含十多位律师的名单，这些律师可以通过电话向上海和其他地方担心参加守夜和抗议活动而遭遇报复的人提供免费咨询。"
"""I'm sure that the number of people who expressed themselves this time, especially the youth, will later shape some policy changes,"" she said. ""I'm sure that the decision makers are not a monolithic lump of iron.""","""我相信这次表达人多，尤其是年轻人表达，后面还是会影响一个政策的变化，""她说。""我们相信这些决策者也不是铁板一块。"""
"In late November, dozens of protests broke out across China, ignited by fury over a deadly fire in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region in the west. The result was the boldest and most widespread demonstrations in China since the pro-democracy movement of 1989.",11月下旬，西部新疆地区首府乌鲁木齐一场致命火灾引发了民众的愤怒，中国各地爆发了多起抗议。这是中国自1989年民主运动以来最大胆、最广泛的示威活动。
"The Urumqi government had firmly denied widespread rumors that the residents killed in the fire 10 by the official count had been trapped in their apartments by Covid restrictions. But many Chinese were unconvinced, and grief turned into wider anger at pervasive lockdowns, virus testing and limits on travel. At demonstrations in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities, some protesters called for Mr. Xi and the Communist Party to give up power.",有广为传播的流言称，火灾中丧生的居民(官方统计为10人)是因封控措施才被困在公寓内，乌鲁木齐市政府对此予以坚决否认。但许多中国人不相信政府的说法，悲痛转变为对大规模封锁、核酸检测和出行限制的更广泛愤怒。在上海、北京和其他城市的示威中，一些抗议者要求习近平和中共放弃权力。
"Since then, the Chinese government has taken a two-pronged approach: detaining some protesters and warning would-be protesters, and letting local governments abandon some of the Covid rules that have frustrated the population. Mr. Xi has not spoken publicly about the protests, and it is unclear how far the displays of dissent played into his decision to adjust policy. But plenty of Chinese people seem to believe that the nationwide defiance played a big role. They may now try to keep up pressure in smaller ways.",那之后，中国政府双管齐下，一方面拘留部分抗议者，并警告想要抗议的人;另一方面让地方政府放弃一些引发民众不满的防疫规定。习近平尚未公开提及抗议，目前还不清楚这些异议会在多大程度上影响他的政策调整决定。但很多中国人似乎认为全国范围内的反抗起到了很大作用。他们现在可能会尝试以更小的方式保持施压。
"""I think what's going to happen is people will coordinate, it will be low-level, it will look individualized and spontaneous, but there will be learning and discussion behind the scenes,"" said Mary Gallagher, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies politics and social change in China.","""我认为民众将会协同一致，协调的程度将是低水平的，看起来更多是个人的和自发性的，但背地里也会有学习和交流，""研究中国政治和社会变革的密歇根大学教授高敏(Mary Gallagher)表示。"
"""That's what you need to do in a politically repressive environment,"" she said. ""It's really going to put pressure on the local governments not to lock down.""","""这就是政治压抑环境中的办法，""她说。""这的确能对地方政府施压，让他们不能封城。"""
"Despite China's hulking authoritarian government, local protests are not uncommon. Before Covid, they often focused on government land seizures, pollution outbreaks and unpaid wages. Since the pandemic, outbursts of discontent have continued. But this renewed pattern of local unrest will test Mr. Xi's government at a particularly delicate time as China seeks to ease Covid restrictions while trying to avoid an uncontrolled surge of infections.",尽管中国有着庞大的威权政府，但地方抗议并不罕见。疫情前，这些抗议往往集中在政府征地、污染泄露和拖欠工资方面。自疫情以来，不满情绪的爆发此起彼伏。但地方动荡的新形态将在这个尤其敏感的时刻考验习近平政府，因为中国正寻求放松防疫限制，同时还要努力避免感染激增失控。
"Hundreds of students at Wuhan University, in the city where the pandemic first took hold starting in late 2019, rallied on a recent rainy evening to call for changes to Covid policies, according to a video that has been verified by The New York Times. ""An open process, transparent information,"" they chanted while holding umbrellas over their heads.","一段经《纽约时报》核实的视频显示，武汉大学的数以百计的学生在最近的一个雨夜集会，呼吁改变防疫政策。武汉是2019年底此次疫情首次出现的地方。""过程公开，信息透明，""他们撑着伞喊道。"
"That relatively mild slogan appeared to be a considered move. A student at the university said that classmates were unhappy about the university's plans to restore in-person teaching, which had upset their plans to go home for a break after months of living under restrictions. The student, who asked to be identified only by his surname, Wu, fearing repercussions, said that he had not attended the rally but had seen videos shared by classmates. He noted that none of the protesters had held pieces of white paper, which have become a symbol of defiance of the government.",这个相对温和的口号似乎经过了深思熟虑。该校一名学生表示，同学们对学校恢复线下教学的计划感到不满，这打乱了他们在限制下生活了几个月后离校回家的计划。这名因担心不良后果，只透露自己姓吴的学生说，他没有参加集会，但是看到了同学们分享的视频。他指出，没有一个抗议者拿着白纸，那已成为反抗政府的象征物。
"The school relented, allowing students to return home and choose between online and in-person classes, Mr. Wu said.",吴同学说，学校后来做出了让步，允许学生离校回家，在网课和线下教学之间进行选择。
"While some cities in China have begun to ease lockdown restrictions, not all local officials have followed suit. They remain under heavy pressure to contain outbreaks, even as more senior leaders want to appear sympathetic to public impatience.",虽然中国的一些城市已经开始放松管控，但并非所有地方官员都这么做。尽管更多高级领导人希望对公众的不耐烦情绪表现出同情，但他们仍然承受着控制疫情的巨大压力。
"In a wealthy district of Shanghai on Sunday afternoon, security teams blocked the entry to an apartment complex after a local committee ordered a lockdown upon discovering a Covid case in one building.",周日下午，在上海的一个高档住宅区，居委会在一栋公寓楼出现新冠病例后，下令保安封锁小区入口。
"Angry residents soon confronted the guards, challenging the closure as unlawful. ""You don't have the right!"" one woman is seen yelling repeatedly in a video posted on Twitter. Hours later, the police arrived and backed the residents. A neighborhood committee worker for the apartment complex told The New York Times that the lockdowns were lifted ""after engagement and coordination.""","愤怒的居民很快与保安对峙起来，质疑封锁非法。""你没有权利!""发布在Twitter上的一段视频中，一名女子不断喊道。几个小时后，警察赶到，他们站在了居民一边。居委会的一名工作人员告诉《纽约时报》，""经过接触和协调后""解除了封锁。"
"In Wuhan over the weekend, residents in one neighborhood took matters into their own hands, pouring into the street after breaking down barriers that had held them in lockdown, as seen in a video posted on Twitter.",周末在武汉，一个社区的居民自行解封，从发布在Twitter上的一段视频可以看到，他们推倒隔离墙，涌上街头。
"With so much risk from taking part in protests, Chinese residents are using an older tactic: citing the central leaders' words to push back against local officials. For centuries, disgruntled people have seized on central government edicts to make their case, often appealing to the idea sincerely held or as a tactic that a well-intentioned ruler in Beijing has been misled by corrupt or disloyal functionaries.",由于参加抗议活动的风险太大，中国民众正在使用一种更古老的策略:引用中央领导人的话来反击地方官员。几个世纪以来，心怀不满的民众一直在利用中央政府的命令来为自己辩护，他们常常诉诸这样一种观点——可能是出于真心，也可能是一种策略——北京的统治者是好的，他们被腐败的或不忠诚的官员误导了。
"""It's this idea that you can use the central government's words against local overreach,"" Professor Gallagher said. ""And it protects you, because the central government is supposed to be benevolent.""","""这种观点认为，你可以用中央政府的话来抵制地方的越权行为，""高敏说。 ""而且它会保护你，因为中央政府应该是体恤民情的。"""
"Chinese are invoking the law to negotiate and push back against persisting pandemic restrictions. In areas that have failed to ease lockdowns, residents have pointed to the government's move in early November to push for local authorities to take a more targeted approach in controlling Covid.",中国人正在以法律为武器进行谈判，以抵制持续的疫情限制措施。在未能放松封锁的地区，居民们指出政府11月初有规定放松管控，以此推动地方当局精准防疫。
"The local confrontations in Shanghai and Wuhan point to the impatience of residents under lockdown who are more worried about paying mortgages, reviving battered businesses and getting children back to regular school.",上海和武汉爆发的冲突表明遭到封锁的民众已经忍无可忍，他们更担心的是偿还贷款、重振遭受重创的企业，以及让孩子返校正常上课。
"""We want to lift the lockdown, our kids need to go to school,"" residents of an apartment complex in Wuxi, eastern China, shouted as they resisted a lockdown of their complex, a video posted on Twitter showed. ""We need to make money to feed our families. We want to eat.""","""我们要解封，小孩子要上学，""发布在Twitter上的一段视频显示，中国东部无锡一公寓楼的居民在抵制封锁时喊道。""要赚钱养家。我们要吃饭。"""
"Members of the legal community have also stepped up to help raise residents' awareness of their rights. As the authorities mobilized to detain protesters and search residents' phones in recent days, often without clear justification, legal advice has circulated on the Chinese internet. One such article outlined citizens' rights in the event that a police officer demands to search their phones.",法律界人士也积极协助市民提高自身权利意识。近日来，随着当局采取行动拘留抗议者，而且在往往缺乏明确理由的情况下搜查民众手机，法律建议在中国的互联网上流传开来。其中一篇文章简要讲述了当警察要求搜查手机时，公民有什么权利。
"In that article, the author, who belongs to a Shanghai law firm, invokes the Chinese Constitution and concludes: ""Arbitrary content checks of citizens' cellphones are a serious infringement of citizens' privacy and an abuse of public power.""","在这篇文章中，就职于上海一家律师事务所的作者援引中国宪法得出结论:""随意查看公民手机中的内容是对公民隐私权的严重侵犯，是滥用公权力对私权利的侵害。"""
"Some of those who have been speaking out, however, continue to face greater pressures. Ms. Wang, 37, the lawyer who helped coordinate advice for worried protesters and their friends and families, said that she had received phone calls from local officials.",然而，一些公开发声的人继续面临更大的压力。37岁的王胜生律师负责协调为忧心忡忡的抗议者及其亲友提供建议，她说，她接到了当地官员的电话。
"She said that she had decided to help the protesters and their families after seeing images circulate on Chinese social media of the vigil in Shanghai commemorating those killed in Urumqi. She had taken a couple of dozen calls, she said, including from people who had been detained and questioned and who wanted to know their rights.",她说，看到中国社交媒体上流传的上海守夜活动纪念乌鲁木齐死难者的照片后，她决定帮助抗议者及其家人。她说，她接到了几十个电话，其中包括被拘留和遭到审问的人，他们想知道自己的权利。
The Chinese authorities have over the past decade tried to silence rights attorneys by revoking their law licenses or by detaining and imprisoning them. But Ms. Wang said that she felt no reason to worry.,过去10年里，中国当局试图通过吊销维权律师执照或拘留、监禁方式，让维权律师噤声。但王胜生说，她觉得没有理由担心。
"""To my mind, I'm just providing a little bit of legal advice services"" to people who took part in protests, she said.","""我想我只是提供一点法律咨询服务嘛，""她说。"
"""How is it that if some people believe that they were in the wrong, then I'm also in the wrong simply by providing them legal advice?"" she added. ""That's fundamentally against the idea of rule of law.""","""凭什么，别的人就认为他们有问题，我给他们提供法律咨询所以我也有问题?""她还说，""这个根本不是法治的思路。"""
"Three years ago in Melbourne, Australia, Ronnie Li and other students from mainland China chanted in support of their government. They were trying to drown out a rally promoting the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, the biggest challenge to Beijing's authority in years.",三年前，罗妮·李曾和其他来自中国大陆的学生一起，在澳大利亚墨尔本高呼支持中国政府的口号。他们试图盖过在当地集会支持香港民主运动的人，香港的那次民主运动给中央政府的权威带来了多年来最大的挑战。
"Ms. Li, 23, has since changed her mind about that issue and about much else.",那之后，现年23岁的李女士已改变了对香港抗议和许多其他事情的看法。
"In recent days, she said, she and other mainland Chinese students have demonstrated in Australia against Beijing's policies, calling for more freedom in China, including an easing of Covid restrictions.",她说，最近几天，她和其他来自中国大陆的学生在澳大利亚举行示威反对中国政府的政策，要求中国有更多的自由，包括放宽新冠疫情的防控限制。
"""Everyone has woken up,"" she said. ""Slowly. Change takes time.""","""大家都醒了，""她说。""慢慢地，转变有个过程。"""
"The recent protests in China have rippled well beyond the mainland, to cities around the world with large contingents of Chinese students even Hong Kong, where the pro-democracy protests of 2019 were crushed and dissent of any kind is now dangerous.",中国最近的抗议活动已波及远离中国大陆的地方，扩大到世界上有大量中国留学生的城市，甚至香港——2019年民主抗议活动遭到镇压后，任何形式的异见在那里都有危险。
"Some young people like Ms. Li members of what has been called China's most nationalistic generation in decades, raised on a censored internet in which the ruling Communist Party can do no wrong have experienced what they describe as a political awakening. It is unclear whether they represent more than a tiny minority, or how far beyond the issue of Covid restrictions their criticism of Beijing might go.",一些像李女士这样的年轻人经历了他们所说的政治觉醒，他们属于被称为中国几十年来最民族主义的一代，在互联网上长大，政府的审查使他们在网上看到的都是执政的中共永远正确的内容。目前还不清楚他们代表的是不是极少数人，也不清楚他们对中国政府的批评会超出新冠清零问题多远。
"But some protesters who oppose the Chinese government for other reasons like the crushing of democracy in Hong Kong, the threat to Taiwan, and China's persecution of Uyghurs in its Xinjiang region have at least tentative hopes that the moment might be used to find common cause with them.",但一些出于其他原因(例如中国压制香港的民主、威胁台湾，以及迫害新疆地区的维吾尔人)反对中国政府的抗议者至少不无试探地希望，也许能利用这个时刻与他们找到共同点。
"""The struggle in the mainland is closely connected to our struggle,"" said Sarah Lau, a Hong Kong resident in her early 20s.","""我觉得内地的斗争和我们的斗争是相关相连的，""20岁出头的香港居民莎拉·刘说。"
"She was one of about two dozen young people, mostly from mainland China, who on Nov. 28 held a vigil in an alley in Hong Kong's Central district. They held up blank sheets of paper used as a symbol of defiance by demonstrators on the mainland and arranged bouquets of flowers around a shrine for victims of the fire in Xinjiang that set off the protests.",她参加了11月28日在香港中环一条小巷里举行的守夜活动，有约20多名主要来自内地的年轻人参加了活动。他们手举被内地抗议者用作反抗象征的白纸，将花束摆放在新疆火灾遇难者的祭奠处，那场火灾引发了内地的抗议活动。
"Dozens of police officers and journalists watched them. The police recorded them with video cameras and took down their names. Afterward, cleaners stuffed the posters, flowers and candles into trash bags.",几十名警察和记者看着他们。警察用摄像机对他们进行了录像，并登记了他们的姓名。活动结束后，清洁工将海报、花束和蜡烛装进了垃圾袋。
"Several such quiet demonstrations have been held in Hong Kong in solidarity with the mainland protests. On Wednesday, Hong Kong's security minister, Chris Tang, said they were driven by ""familiar faces"" from the 2019 protests.","香港已举行了多次这种安静的、声援内地抗议者的示威活动。上周三，香港保安局局长邓炳強把近日的示威描述为""再次颜色革命的雏型""。"
"He also issued a warning: ""Being a mainland student does not mean you're innocent.""","他还发出警告:""警方执法一视同仁，不是说中国内地学生就无事。"""
"Ms. Li, the student in Australia, is one of a number of people from the mainland who have expressed contrition on Twitter about their past attitudes toward the Hong Kong protesters. She said she began feeling more sympathetic toward them last year, after spending more than a month in quarantine in China.",一些来自中国大陆的学生，包括留学澳大利亚的李女士，已在Twitter上就自己之前对香港抗议者的态度表示了悔意。李女士说，去年她在中国被隔离了一个多月后，开始对香港抗议者有更多的同情。
"""We can only say that the Chinese have been brainwashed too well,"" she said. ""It's not the people's fault. The Communist Party is to blame.""","""只能说中国人被ccp(中国共产党——编注)洗脑得太好了，""她说。""大家都没错，错的是共产党。"""
"Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong democracy activist who now lives in London, said he had gotten several notes of apology from such people in recent days. ""Now we understand completely,"" read one message, which he posted online. ""Apologies for our ignorance then.""","现居伦敦的香港著名民主活动人士罗冠聪说，他已在最近几天多次收到像李女士这样的人发的道歉信息。""现在我们彻底明白了，""他分享到网上的一条道歉信息写道:""为我们曾经的无知道歉。"""
"In an interview, Mr. Law said it was unclear whether such bridge-building would do much to advance the protests in China. But he said it would help demonstrators facing the Chinese state to feel less isolated. ""Being understood is quite important, because many people might be feeling very lonely and fearful while protesting,"" he said.","罗冠聪在接受采访时说，不清楚这些友好表示对推动中国大陆的抗议活动会起多大作用。但他说，这有助于让面对中国政府的示威者们感到少一些孤独。""被了解是很重要的，因为很多人是在非常孤单和恐惧的状况下在做这些事情，""他说。"
"In Taipei, Taiwan's capital, more than 100 people gathered in front of National Taiwan University's library on Wednesday to support the mainland protests. They arranged candles to form the letters ""A4,"" a reference to the blank sheets of paper used in the protests.","上周三在台湾台北，100多人聚集在国立台湾大学图书馆前，支持大陆的抗议活动。他们用蜡烛组成""A4""，指的是大陆抗议活动中使用的白纸。"
"For an hour, students from Taiwan, Hong Kong and the mainland took turns speaking. Vivian Chen, 22, urged people in Taiwan to look beyond their political differences even those as fundamental as whether the island should be independent from China and stand behind the protesters on the mainland. ""It may be very difficult to become partners fighting for the same causes, but our intentions to support are sincere,"" Ms. Chen said.","来自台湾、香港和大陆的学生在一个小时里轮流发言。现年22岁的陈薇安呼吁台湾人超越他们与大陆人的政治分歧，甚至是台湾是否应该独立这种根本分歧，支持大陆的抗议者。""或许我们很难成为争取同样目标的伙伴，但是我们支持的心仍然真诚，""陈薇安说。"
"On the mainland, the protests may have drawn more attention to the Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim Turkic minority who have been the target of a crackdown that detained vast numbers of them in internment camps. Many in China were aware of a Covid lockdown in Xinjiang that led to shortages of food and medicine. Then the deadly fire last month in the regional capital, Urumqi, set off the recent protests.",在中国大陆，抗议活动也许引起了人们对维吾尔人的更多关注。维族是一个以穆斯林为主、讲一种突厥语系语言的少数民族，中国政府一直把维吾尔人作为镇压对象，将大量维吾尔人关进拘禁营。中国的许多人知道新疆的新冠防疫封控导致了食品和药品短缺。后来，新疆首府乌鲁木齐上个月发生了致命火灾，引发了最近的抗议活动。
"But activists and experts said that while the protesters knew about the fire and expressed solidarity with Uyghurs about the lockdown, that empathy did not necessarily extend to the group's broader plight.",但活动人士和专家表示，虽然抗议者知道火灾的情况，也对被封控的维吾尔人表示声援，但他们的同情并不一定会延伸到维吾尔人更广泛的困境上。
"""Most people in China don't really understand the camp system,"" said Darren Byler, an anthropologist who studies the minority populations in northwestern China and the Uyghur diaspora. ""They don't see Xinjiang as the Uyghur homeland. They see Xinjiang as a part of China, another province far away.""","""大多数中国人并不真正了解拘禁营系统，""研究中国西北地区少数民族和旅居海外维吾尔人的人类学家雷风(Darren Byler)说。""他们不把新疆看作维吾尔人的家园。他们认为新疆是中国的一部分，是个遥远的省份。"""
But some Uyghurs overseas who attended recent protests saw some hope for changing minds.,但一些参加了最近的抗议活动的海外维吾尔人看到了改变人们想法的希望。
"A Uyghur student in Vancouver who asked to remain anonymous, fearing for the safety of her relatives in Xinjiang said that after days of watching footage of the fire, she decided to commemorate the victims. She shared a photo of a candle, a time and a location on social media, and was surprised when about 100 people showed up.",一名在温哥华读书的维吾尔学生说，她好几天都在看有关火灾的视频，后来她决定组织一个悼念遇难者的活动。由于担心她在新疆的亲属安全，她要求不具名。她在社交媒体上分享了一张蜡烛照片以及活动的时间和地点，大约有100人参加了活动，这让她非常吃惊。
"The rally was held almost entirely in Mandarin. The student played a recording of a Uyghur ballad, yelled slogans calling for an end to internment camps and even joined in the chorus of China's national anthem, feeling that one line ""Stand up, ye who refuse to be enslaved!"" spoke to the moment.","悼念活动几乎完全用普通话进行。该学生播放了一段维吾尔民谣，高呼要求结束拘禁营的口号，甚至加入了中国国歌的合唱，她觉得""起来!不愿做奴隶的人们!""这句歌词非常适合那一刻。"
"She does not usually bring up the camps, a subject which her friends who belong to China's Han ethnic majority have been skeptical about. But the gathering left her with the impression that at least some of the rally attendees might be starting to see the issue differently.",她通常不提拘禁营，她的中国汉族朋友们一直对拘禁营的存在持怀疑态度。但悼念活动给她留下的印象是，至少一些参加活动的人也许正在开始改变对这个问题的看法。
"Ben Yan, 29, who said he belonged to another ethnic minority group in China, said he had previously doubted reports of internment camps in Xinjiang. But the experience of living through lockdown in Shanghai, which he called ""hell on earth,"" led him to believe that the authorities were capable of it.","现年29岁的本·严属于中国的另一个少数民族，他说他以前对新疆拘禁营的报道持怀疑态度。但在经历了他称之为""人间地狱""的上海封城之后，他相信当局干得出那种事。"
"""I now have every reason to believe that Uyghurs have suffered unimaginably,"" said Mr. Yan, who left China this fall and is currently in Japan, where he left flowers and blank paper at the Chinese consulate in Nagoya as a form of protest. ""But the general Han people still don't understand or believe what had happened to them. I think that's a problem.""","""我完全有理由相信维吾尔人遭受到了难以想象的苦难，""严先生已在秋天离开了中国，目前在日本，他在中国驻名古屋领事馆前摆放了鲜花和白纸，以示抗议。""但是普遍汉族人还不了解或者不相信他们的遭遇，我认为是个问题。"""
"An online group that describes itself as run by overseas Chinese students and young people called ""Not Your Little Pink,"" referring to a dismissive term for brash young nationalists who belligerently defend China online said it was important for the demonstrations to address the persecution of Uyghurs.","一个自称由海外的中国学生和年轻人组成的在线团体""不粉红""表示，抗议活动关注受迫害的维吾尔人很重要。该团体的名字与人们对在网上气势汹汹地捍卫中国的傲慢年轻民族主义者的蔑称有关。"
"In one widely shared post, the group said that some protest chants, such as ""We are all Xinjiang people"" and ""I am also a victim of the fire,"" overlooked the targeted nature of Uyghur persecution. It argued that the closing of internment camps should be among the movement's demands.","""不粉红""在一篇被广泛转发的帖子中写道，一些抗议口号，例如""我们都是新疆人""和""我也是火灾受害者""，忽视了政府把维吾尔人作为迫害对象的问题。该帖提出理由说，关闭拘禁营应该是抗议运动的诉求之一。"
"Rayhan Asat, a United States-based Uyghur human rights lawyer, said in an email that the protests ""present a real but limited opportunity to open the eyes of the Han to what we've been going through."" She said she had spoken to Chinese students who were outraged by the Urumqi fire but continued to defend the camp system in Xinjiang.","旅居美国的维吾尔人权律师莱汉·阿萨特在一封电子邮件中写道，抗议活动""提供了一个真实但有限的机会，让汉族人了解我们正在经历的事情""。她说，她曾与对乌鲁木齐大火感到愤怒的中国学生交谈，但他们继续捍卫新疆的拘禁营系统。"
"""Imagine if they protested against all forms of illegal detention and denounced the concentration camps. We'd see results,"" she said. ""After this tragedy, Chinese people cannot pretend they don't know.""","""想象一下，如果他们抗议所有形式的非法拘禁，谴责新疆拘禁营的存在，我们会看到实效的，""她说。""这场悲剧之后，中国人不能假装不知道。"""
"The narrow alleyways of Haizhu district have long beckoned to China's strivers, people like Xie Pan, a textile worker from a mountainous tea-growing area in central China.",长久以来，海珠区那些逼仄小巷一直吸引着中国的打拼一族，比如来自中国中部产茶山区的纺织工人谢潘(音)。
"Home to one of the country's biggest fabric markets, Haizhu houses worker dormitories and textile factories in brightly colored buildings stacked so close that neighbors can shake hands out their windows. Once a smattering of rural villages, the area became a manufacturing hub as China opened its economy decades ago. The government had promised to step back and let people unleash their ambitions, and millions flocked to Haizhu to do just that.",海珠区是中国最大的纺织品市场之一，工人宿舍和纺织厂坐落于色彩明亮的建筑之中，这些建筑间距很近，邻里之间从窗口能握手。这里曾经只有散落的村庄，但随着中国几十年前开放经济变成了制造业中心。政府承诺放宽管理，让人民追求自己的抱负，涌入海珠区的无数人正是为此而来。
"Mr. Xie made the hopeful journey last year, joining others from Hubei Province who had also settled in this dense pocket of the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. They toiled in cacophonous factories, peddled cloth or sold sesame noodles, a hometown favorite. But when I met him a few months ago, his hope had dimmed. Because of a slowing economy, he had been homeless for two weeks before stringing together money to rent a 100-square-foot room for $120 a month.",去年，谢潘踏上了希望之旅，与其他来自湖北的工人一样，在南方大都市广州这个人口稠密区定居下来。他们在嘈杂的工厂中辛苦劳作，忙于制衣或是兜售家乡名小吃热干面。但几个月前我见到他时，他的希望已经变得渺茫。由于经济放缓，他已经两周无家可归，后来才凑钱以每月800多元的价格租了个10平米见方的单间。
"""There isn't enough work for everyone,"" Mr. Xie, 31, a soft-spoken man with hunched shoulders from years bent over sewing machines, said then. ""You can't go to bed every night having to look for work in the morning. It's too tiring.""","""不是人人都有活干，""31岁的谢潘当时说道。他讲话轻声细语，由于常年在缝纫机前劳作而变得驼背。""没法一觉睡醒就去找工作。太累了。"""
"It would get much worse, after a strict Covid lockdown silenced the factories and shuttered the noodle shops. In October, Mr. Xie was quarantined for nearly a month.",后来情况变得更糟，严格的新冠封锁让工厂停工，面馆纷纷关门。到10月，谢潘被隔离了近一个月时间。
"Several weeks later, Haizhu exploded in discontent. After a weekend of protests against ""zero Covid"" restrictions across the country, hundreds of workers defied lockdown rules and swarmed Haizhu's streets on Tuesday, demanding freedom. They tore down street barricades and threw glass bottles. ""End the lockdown!"" they shouted as police officers in hazmat suits marched through the alleys, banging clubs against their shields.","几周后，海珠区的民怨爆发了。当周末全国各地爆发反对新冠清零限制的抗议，数以百计的工人在周二违抗封锁规定，冲上海珠区街头，要求解封。他们拆除了街上的路障，还投掷玻璃瓶。当穿着防护服的警察穿过街巷，用警棍敲打盾牌时，他们喊道，""解封!"""
"The eruption was a forceful illustration of how thoroughly the world's toughest pandemic restrictions have upended life in China. Xi Jinping, the country's strongman leader, is expanding the Chinese Communist Party's grip over its people beyond what even Mao Zedong attained. Mr. Xi has tied the success of ""zero Covid"" to his own legitimacy as ruler, and enforcing it has taken precedence over nurturing the freewheeling spirit that made Haizhu, and China, so vibrant.","这次爆发有力说明了世界上最严厉的防疫措施如何颠覆了中国人的生活。中国的强人领袖习近平正在扩大中共对民众的控制，其程度更甚于毛泽东时代。习近平将新冠""清零""的成功与他作为统治者的合法性捆绑到一起，强制""清零""已经压过自由开放精神的培养，哪怕后者正是让海珠区以及整个中国生气勃勃的原因。"
"The shift strikes at the party's longstanding social contract with its people. After violently crushing pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989, Beijing struck an implicit bargain: In exchange for limitations on political freedoms, the people would get stability and comfort.",这种转变撕毁了党与人民长期以来达成的社会契约。在1989年暴力镇压天安门的民主示威后，北京达成了一项不言而明的交易:人民要以限制政治自由为代价，换来生活的稳定和舒适。
"But now the stability and comfort have dwindled, even as the limitations have grown. Nearly 530 million people almost 40 percent of the population were under some form of lockdown in late November, according to one estimate. People have died because of delayed medical care, or gone hungry.",但如今，这种稳定和舒适都受到了损害，限制却不断加码。据一项统计，11月下旬，近5.3亿人——也就是总人口的近40%——都处于某种形式的封锁之下。有人食不果腹，有人则因耽误救治丧生。
"Already, China's security apparatus is moving to suppress the demonstrations against ""zero Covid,"" the most widespread protests China has seen since Tiananmen. The police have detained and threatened participants across the country. The government, while not publicly acknowledging the protests, has also tried to blunt public outrage by easing restrictions, including lifting some lockdowns in Guangzhou.","中国的安全机器已经开始镇压反对""清零""的示威活动，这是自天安门事件以来中国发生的最为广泛的抗议。全国各地的警方都在拘捕和威胁参与者。政府虽然没有公开回应这些抗议，但也试图通过放松限制来平息公愤，包括广州的部分解封。"
"Even if Mr. Xi drives discontent back underground, the disillusionment that the protests exposed may remain. ""Zero Covid"" made clear the ease, and apparent arbitrariness, with which the party could and would impose its will on people. For many Chinese, such dominance has shaken their expectation of constant progress, and chipped away at their ambition and willingness to take risks.","但即便习近平能掩盖这些不满情绪，抗议所揭露的幻灭感可能依然存在。""清零""本身就已经表明，党能够且将会轻易和肆意地把自身意志强加于人民。对许多中国人来说，这种颐指气使动摇了他们不断进步的期望，也打击了他们冒险的抱负和意愿。"
"Perhaps nowhere will this shift play out more poignantly than in the biggest metropolises of southern China: Guangzhou and neighboring Shenzhen. It was here where China's market reforms first took off. A colleague and I spent two weeks in the region earlier this year, to see how the changing social contract has fueled frustration, resignation and anxiety feelings starkly at odds with the triumphalist vision of national rejuvenation that Mr. Xi has promoted.",这种转变在中国南方最大的都市广州及毗邻的深圳可能表现得最为深刻。中国的市场改革正是从这里起步。今年早些时候，我与一位同事在该地区待了两周，以了解正在改变的社会契约如何助长了不满、放弃和焦虑——这些情绪都与习近平提倡的民族复兴必胜愿景南辕北辙。
"Mr. Xie was released from quarantine last month, before the recent clashes. He fled Guangzhou, unsure whether he would return. ""This place if I can avoid it, I will.""","谢潘上个月解除了隔离，就在冲突爆发前。他逃离了广州，不确定是否还会回来。""广州这个地方，确实，能不去就尽量不去。"""
A Fading Promise,渺茫的希望
"At the heart of the region's appeal was its promise of something for everyone. There were factories for rural migrants, technology powerhouses for aspiring coders, storefronts for entrepreneurs. Anyone could trade grit and drive for a better life.",这一地区的吸引力在于它能给所有人希望。这里有农民工能去的工厂，有想一展手脚的程序员能去的科技大厂，还有给创业者的商铺。只要有坚韧和干劲，就能过上更好的生活。
"Mr. Xie moved to Guangzhou last year, chasing higher pay to support his two young children. But when he arrived, he found a different hustle than expected.",为了两个年幼的孩子，谢潘去年搬到广州，希望赚到更多钱。但当他来到这里，却发现了意料之外的麻烦。
"Many factories had cut back as the slowing economy and lockdowns choked demand for new clothing. Each morning, Mr. Xie elbowed through nearly standstill crowds of job seekers to haggle with factory bosses over ever-lower rates for piecework, like finishing the hems on a shirt, or the pleats on a skirt. In August, he earned $40 to $50 a day he had heard that people earned double that before the pandemic on the days he earned anything.",由于经济放缓和封锁抑制了人们购新衣的需求，许多工厂已经减产。每天早上，谢潘都要挤过几乎密不透风的求职人群，与工厂老板就越来越低的计件工资讨价还价，这种工作包括给衬衫缝制下摆，或是给裙装打褶。8月时，如果有收入，他每天能赚到两三百元，但他听说疫情前别人的收入是这个数字的两倍。
"At work, he hastily swallowed lunches of white rice and tofu, surrounded by knee-high piles of fabric and the drone of sewing machines.",他边工作边靠米饭和豆腐充饥，周围是齐膝高的一堆堆织物和缝纫机的低鸣。
"Then, in October, the coronavirus began spreading in Haizhu, as did lockdowns. Confined to his room, then to a quarantine center, Mr. Xie's money dried up.",然后到10月，新冠病毒开始在海珠区传播，封锁接踵而至。谢潘先是被关在家中，后来又被关进隔离中心，钱很快就用光了。
"The morning he was released, he boarded a train back to Hubei. ""I've been out of work for so long, I'm about to go hungry,"" Mr. Xie said when reached at home.","解除封控的当天早上，他就登上了返回湖北的火车。""因为现在都失业了，这段时间，马上饿肚子，""回到家中的谢潘表示。"
"It's not just in factories that upward mobility seems increasingly out of reach. The same is true in the region's skyscrapers, once the gleaming proofs of dreams achieved.",向上流动的可能性不仅在工厂变得遥不可及。在这里的摩天大楼也是如此，那曾是梦想成真的光辉证明。
"Before the pandemic, Ryan Liu embodied the promise of his hometown, Shenzhen. After growing up in a working-class family, Mr. Liu, 34, became a product manager at one of China's internet giants. He collected whiskey and vacationed abroad, savoring the high-flying lifestyle that China's modernization made possible.",疫情前，瑞安·刘(音)就代表了他的家乡深圳所承诺的希望。34岁的瑞安·刘在工薪阶层家庭长大，是中国一家互联网巨头的产品经理。他的爱好是收集威士忌和出国度假，享受着中国现代化带来的上流生活方式。
"But ""zero Covid"" bowed even China's internet giants. The e-commerce titan Alibaba reported a net loss of nearly $3 billion last quarter, in part because of weak consumer demand. Tencent, China's most valuable company, laid off thousands of employees this year, the first time in nearly a decade that its work force had shrunk.",但新冠清零让中国互联网巨头也不得不低头。电商巨头阿里巴巴报告上季度净亏损近206亿元，部分原因是消费者需求疲软。中国市值最高的腾讯今年进行了大规模裁员，这是近十年来该公司员工人数首次缩减。
"The comfortable life that Mr. Liu had built for himself suddenly seemed precarious. He had started reading job postings to be safe, he said over a protein bowl near his office in Shenzhen's Hi-Tech Industrial Park, where high-rises offer amenities like karaoke pods and indoor running tracks. He stopped buying whiskey and sold his stock investments.",瑞安·刘为自己创造的舒适生活突然变得岌岌可危。为防意外，他说自己已经开始浏览招聘信息，当时他正在深圳高新技术产业园内的办公室附近吃着沙拉，这里的高层写字楼都设有独立唱K房和室内跑道等便利设施。他不再购买威士忌，并卖掉了股票投资。
"Mr. Liu was now focused on paying off his mortgage and building his savings. ""The next few years,"" he said, ""will also be pretty hard.""","瑞安·刘现在把重点放在了还清贷款和储蓄之上。""因为可以预见到往后几年也会比较困难，""他说。"
'The State Is Everywhere',"""国家无处不在"""
"The sound of construction began immediately after officials detected a lone case of Covid in Xiasha, a dense Shenzhen neighborhood known for its cheap eats and affordable housing. That afternoon, workers hauled sheets of metal and red plastic to erect barriers preventing anyone from leaving a physical manifestation of the party's increasingly overt control over daily life.",下沙是深圳一处人口稠密的社区，以廉价餐饮和经济适用房闻名。当官员们在这里发现一例新冠阳性，施工的声音立即想起。当天下午，工人们运来了金属板和红色塑料板，竖起屏障阻止任何人离开——这实体呈现了党对日常生活愈发明显的控制。
"""Even jail isn't like that,"" said Wu Qunlin, 56, who runs a massage parlor here, recalling the two-week barricade in July his second lockdown this year.","""监狱都没这样，""56岁的吴群林(音)在这里经营一家按摩院，他回忆起7月那次为期两周的封锁时表示，那是他今年第二次被封。"
"Even after the walls came down, the intrusions remained. Covid tests were required every 24 hours. People entering the neighborhood had to show proof of residence. Officials monitored people's movements via their cellphones.",即便在围墙撤走之后，对生活的滋扰依然存在。每24小时就要做一次核酸。进入社区的人必须出示居住证明。官员通过手机监视着人们的行动。
"The mobilization of so many hyperlocal officials one state media report estimated that one had been deployed for every 250 adults represents ""possibly the largest expansion of Chinese state capacity in the past 40 years,"" said Taisu Zhang, a law professor at Yale who studies China. ""It used to be, for most people you didn't really feel the state in your daily life too much. Now, of course, the state is everywhere.""","动员如此众多的底层官员——有官媒报道称每人要负责管理约250名成年人——说明了""可能是过去40年来中国政府能力的最大扩张，""研究中国问题的耶鲁大学法学教授张泰苏表示。""以前大多数人在日常生活中是感受不到多少国家的影响的。现在的情况就变成，国家无处不在。"""
"Officials even entered apartments in Xiasha, checking closets and under beds for people with Covid who might have been trying to avoid detection.",官员们甚至进入下沙的公寓，检查衣柜和床下，寻找可能试图逃避检测的新冠病毒感染者。
"Mr. Wu, who opened his business 20 years ago, said he had done his best to cooperate with the Covid measures. He took daily tests. He got vaccinated. Yet there he was, sitting in a mostly dark alley, reeling off the neighboring shops a photography studio, another massage parlor that had gone out of business. Only one customer had come by that evening, to ask about prices (about $21 for a standard massage), but ultimately walked away.",20年前开始做生意的吴群林说，他已经尽了最大努力配合新冠措施。他每天都测核酸。他打了疫苗。然而，到头来他坐在几乎一片漆黑的巷子里，打量着附近那些已经关门的店铺——一家照相馆，另一家按摩院。当晚只有一位顾客来询问价格(标准按摩约150元)，但最终还是离开了。
"""You've managed us before, that's the function of the state,"" Mr. Wu said. But, ""it's like if your parents tried to control you too much you'd feel uncomfortable. And if you didn't do anything about it, you'd also feel uncomfortable, right?""","""你过去管我们，也是国家的职能，""吴群林说。但是，""好像你爹妈管你管得实在太狠了，你肯定也会不舒服。所以说你不反抗，你也肯定不舒服，就这样对不对?"""
'Unless Necessary',"""非必要"""
"The question facing ""zero Covid"" is this: Now that people are expressing their dissatisfaction, what comes next?","""清零""面临的问题是:现在人们都在表达不满，那接下来又会怎样?"
"The protests that erupted over the past week were rooted in the stringent coronavirus policies, but some protesters expanded their demands to more directly confront the party's reassertion of power. In Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere, they chanted for democracy, freedom of speech, an end to the authoritarianism that had enabled ""zero Covid"" in the first place.","过去一周爆发的抗议活动源于严厉的新冠政策，但一些抗议者扩大了要求，更直接地对抗党对权力的重申。在北京、上海和其他地方，他们高呼民主、言论自由，呼吁结束让""清零""成为可能的威权主义。"
"But the security apparatus has grown only stronger from the past three years of controls. It is also not clear how many of the protesters share the demands, or the aspiration, for more political freedom; the angry workers in Guangzhou were focused on the basic right to work and move freely. If China manages to limit the impact of future outbreaks as it loosens restrictions, the sense of shared grievance could sputter.",但是，经过过去三年的控制，安全机构变得更加强大。目前还不清楚有多少抗议者有同样的要求或渴望更多政治自由;愤怒的广州工人关注的是工作和自由行动的基本权利。如果中国在放松限制的同时成功限制了未来疫情的影响，共同的不满可能会消散。
"Still, even if ""zero Covid"" goes away, Mr. Xi's broader fixation on control is unlikely to do the same. In that environment, it remains to be seen whether the ambition that fueled China's rise can still thrive.","不过，即使""清零""政策取消了，习近平对控制的更大执着也不可能随之消失。在这种环境下，推动中国崛起的雄心壮志是否还能蓬勃发展，还有待观察。"
"That ambition drove Li Hong, 36, to take over a clothing factory last year in Haizhu. Since arriving from Hubei 16 years ago, Ms. Li had worked her way from the factory floor to management, and she was hungry to keep advancing and betting on herself. She knew the economy was shaky, but with so many factories going under, she could get one at a good price.",这种雄心驱使36岁的李红(音)去年收购了海珠的一家服装厂。自从16年前从湖北来到这里，李红一直从工厂的底层工作到管理层，她渴望不断进步，不断投资自己。她知道经济不稳定，但随着许多工厂倒闭，她可以廉价买下一家工厂。
"""Opportunities come to those who are prepared, but even if there aren't opportunities, we want to go find them,"" she said this summer in her small back office, where she kept a couch for naps during long shifts.","""机会都是给有做准备的人，但是我们就是说没有机会也想去找这个机会，""今年夏天，她在自己的小办公室里说。她在办公室里放了一张沙发，方便加班时打盹。"
But this spring's lockdown in Shanghai cut off orders from a major client there. Then came the Guangzhou outbreak. Factories in Haizhu were ordered to close. Ms. Li tested positive and was sent to a makeshift hospital.,但今年春天，因为上海封城，切断了当地一家大客户的订单。接着，广州暴发疫情。海珠区的工厂被勒令关闭。李红自己检测呈阳性，被送往方舱。
"After being released two weeks later, she returned to Hubei because her home in Guangzhou was sealed off, she said by phone. Her factory lease expires in January; she did not know if she would renew.",她在电话里说，两周后她离开方舱，回到了湖北老家，因为在广州的家被封了。她的工厂租约将于明年1月到期;她不知道自己是否会续约。
"She had always considered herself a go getter, especially in a world where female factory bosses are rare. But she knew that individual drive went only so far. Even after Guangzhou eased restrictions after the protests, she worried that local officials were merely trying to avoid more bad publicity, not listening to people's demands.",她一直自认为是个能干人，尤其是在一个罕有女性当工厂老板的世界里。但她知道，光是自己有冲劲是不够的。即使广州在抗议活动后放宽了限制，她还是担心当地官员只是想避开更多的负面宣传，而不是倾听民众的需求。
"""They won't make decisions based on what you want,"" Ms. Li said. Ultimately, she was resigned: ""They set the policies the way they want, and I'll do whatever other people do.""","""他不会按你的要求去执行那些，""李红说。最终她选择听天由命，""他们政策怎么下，别人怎么做，我就怎么做。"""
"The reining in of expectations is perhaps best encapsulatedby a phrase ubiquitous in China's Covid restrictions: ""Unless necessary."" Officials have instructed citizens: Do not gather ""unless necessary,"" do not leave home ""unless necessary."" Many Chinese who had learned to dream of progress even luxury suddenly have been told, again, to expect only the essentials.",在中国的新冠限制措施中，一句无处不在的话或许可以最好地概括对期望值的约束——非必要。官员告诉民众:非必要不聚集、非必要不出门。许多曾经梦想着进步——甚至是奢华——的中国人突然又被告知，只许期待最基本的东西。
"Still, some hold on to hope that the retreat is a blip. For all the present difficulties, the years of extraordinary growth are still fresh in many minds.",尽管如此，一些人仍然希望这种倒退只是暂时的。尽管目前存在种种困难，但在许多人的脑海中，当年的非凡增长岁月仍然记忆犹新。
"Atop a hill in Shenzhen's Lianhuashan Park stands a 20-foot bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping. Mr. Deng, the leader who pioneered China's embrace of market forces after Mao's death, watches over the city that is a living reminder of the country's ability to change direction. Mr. Deng is shown in midstride, to honor his credo that opening should only accelerate.",在深圳莲花山公园的小山顶上，伫立着六米高的邓小平铜像。毛泽东去世后，邓小平是率先拥抱市场经济的中国领导人，他的目光注视着这座城市，以生动的方式提醒着人们，这个国家是有能力改变方向的。邓小平的塑像迈着稳健的步伐，彰显他开放只会加速的信条。
"Chen Chengzhi, 80, a retired government cadre who hikes to that statue every day for exercise, credits Mr. Deng with changing his life. Mr. Chen moved to Shenzhen in the 1980s, soon after Mr. Deng allowed economic experimentation here. The city then had just a few hundred thousand people, but Mr. Chen, who had endured famine and the Cultural Revolution, believed in Mr. Deng's vision.",80岁的政府退休干部陈承志(音)每天都要来到这里锻炼，他认为是邓小平改变了自己的生活。上世纪80年代，在邓小平允许深圳进行经济试验后不久，陈承志就搬到了深圳。当时这座城市只有几十万人口，但经历过饥荒和文化大革命的陈承志相信邓小平的愿景。
"""At the end of the day, all good things in China are related to Shenzhen,"" Mr. Chen said on one of his daily walks, adding that he cheered when China's premier, Li Keqiang, visited the statue in August and pledged that China would continue opening to the world.","""有什么好事都跟深圳有关，""陈承志在每天例行的散步时说道。他还说，当中国总理李克强8月参观这座雕像并承诺中国将继续向世界开放时，他感到欢欣鼓舞。"
"If it doesn't do so, Mr. Chen said, ""China will hit a dead end.""","如果不这样做，陈承志说，""中国就是死路一条。"""
"But Mr. Li is retiring, even as the Xi Jinping era of rising state control stretches on.",但李克强即将退休，而国家控制不断增强的习近平时代仍在继续。
"For now, Mr. Chen continues climbing the hill looking over the city that he helped build, that he believes in still.",现在，陈承志每天还是会继续攀爬这座小山——俯瞰着他参与建设的城市，他仍然相信这座城市。
"On Sunday, when Mr. Zhang went to protest China's strict Covid policies in Beijing, he thought he came prepared to go undetected.",周日，当张先生在北京抗议中国严厉的防疫政策时，他以为自己做足了不会暴露身份的准备。
"He wore a balaclava and goggles to cover his face. When it seemed that plainclothes police officers were following him, he ducked into the bushes and changed into a new jacket. He lost his tail. That night, when Mr. Zhang, who is in his 20s, returned home without being arrested, he thought he was in the clear.",他戴了滑雪面罩，还用护目镜遮脸。看到似乎有便衣警察跟踪，他躲进灌木丛换上了另一件外套。他甩掉了尾随者。当晚，当20多岁的张先生安然无恙地回到家中，他以为自己没事了。
"But the police called the next day. They knew he had been out because they were able to detect that his phone had been in the area of the protests, they told him. Twenty minutes later, even though he had not told them where he lived, three officers knocked at his door.",但第二天警察就来电话了。他们告诉他，警方知道他去了现场，因为能检测到他的手机一直在抗议发生的区域。尽管他没透露自己的住址，但三名警察还是在20分钟后上门了。
"Similar stories are being told by protesters across China this week, according to interviews with those targeted and human rights groups following cases. As the authorities seek to track, intimidate and detain those who marched in defiance of the government's strict Covid policies last weekend, they are turning to powerful tools of surveillance the state has spent the past decade building for moments like this, when parts of the population turn out and question the authority of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.",根据对被警方盯上者以及跟进案例的人权组织的采访，中国各地的抗议者在本周都遭遇了类似的情况。随着当局开始追踪、恐吓和拘捕上周末游行反抗政府严厉新冠政策的人，政府在过去十年间打造的强大监视工具就在此刻——即部分人走上街头质疑执政中共的权威之时——派上了用场。
"The police have used faces, phones and informants to identify those who attended protests. Usually they force those they track down to pledge not to protest again. Often inexperienced with being tracked, protesters expressed bafflement at how they were found out. Out of fear of further repercussions, many have deleted foreign apps like Telegram that have been used to coordinate and spread images of the protests overseas.",警方通过人脸、手机和线人来确认抗议者的身份。通常情况下，他们会强迫那些被追踪到的人保证不再参与抗议。抗议者通常都没有经历过这种追踪，对于自己如何被暴露都表示不解。因为害怕遭遇更多报复手段，许多人删除了Telegram等国外的应用程序，这些程序一直被用来在海外协调和传播抗议影像。
Chinese police have assembled one of the world's most sophisticated surveillance systems. They have hung cameras by the millions on street corners and at the entrances to buildings. They have bought powerful facial recognition software and programmed it to identify local citizens. Special software crunches the data and images that are scooped up.,中国警方打造了全球领先的监控系统。他们在街角和建筑物入口处放置了数以百万计的监控摄像头。他们购买了功能强大的人脸识别软件，并通过编程识别当地公民。收集到的数据和影像会有特殊软件进行处理。
"Although the construction of the surveillance system was no secret, to many in China it has felt remote. The police more commonly use it to track dissidents, ethnic minorities and migrant workers. Many express support for it under the idea that if you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide.",尽管打造监控系统不是秘密，但对许多中国人来说，那似乎是远离日常的东西。警方通常用它来追踪异见人士、少数民族和外来务工者。许多人对此的支持是出于这样一种想法:没做什么见不得人的事情，怕什么。
"The interrogations of the last week may shake that outlook. It is the first time the surveillance state has been directed squarely at large numbers of middle-class people in China's most affluent cities. While many have experience with censorship and this week proved they can sometimes get around it a police visit at home is less common, and more intimidating.",过去一周来自警方的盘问可能会动摇这个想法。这是这个监控国家首次对中国最富裕城市的大量中产阶级进行直接监控。虽然很多人都遭遇过审查——本周的情况也证明他们有时能够躲避审查——但警察上门的情况并不常见，也更令人不安。
"""We're hearing stories of police turning up on people's doorsteps asking them their whereabouts during the protests, and this appears to be based on the evidence gathered through mass surveillance,"" said Alkan Akad, a China researcher at Amnesty International. ""China's 'Big Brother' technology is never switched off, and the government hopes it will now show its effectiveness in snuffing out unrest,"" he added.","""我们听到一些说法，警察会上门了解他们在抗议期间的行踪，这可能是基于大规模监控收集到的证据，""国际特赦组织的中国研究员阿尔卡·阿卡德说。他还表示，""中国的'老大哥'技术从未关过，政府希望它现在就能显示出平息骚乱方面的有效性。"""
"The marches and protests have been some of the most widespread and openly political since those of 1989, which Beijing put down with lethal military force at Tiananmen Square. Now Chinese authorities can smother unrest by using the high-tech dragnet to target organizers and the most outspoken malcontents and detain them. Followers and onlookers often get away with a stern threat.",这些游行和抗议是自1989年北京在天安门广场动用致命武力镇压以来，中国发生的最为广泛和公开的政治抗议活动。如今，中国当局可以利用高科技的天罗地网锁定组织者和最出挑的抗议者，拘捕他们来压制动乱。而追随者和旁观者往往能够脱身，只会得到一次严厉警告。
"Mr. Zhang's experience is a common one. Although he knew about the facial recognition cameras that clutter China's public spaces, he underestimated the phone trackers. Tiny boxes with antennas, the devices are much easier to miss. Mimicking a cell tower, they connect to the phones of all who pass by, and record the data for the police to check. Still, Mr. Zhang, who like other protesters interviewed for this article declined to give his full name out of fear of police reprisal, was lucky. After a harsh interrogation and a warning not to attend a protest again, the police left his apartment.",张先生的经历很普遍。虽然他知道中国的公共场所到处都是人脸识别摄像头，但他低估了手机信号的追踪能力。这些带有天线的小型设备很容易被忽视，它们装作手机信号塔，连接所有经过者的手机，并记录数据供警方检查。尽管如此，与本文采访中的其他抗议者一样，因为害怕警方报复而拒绝透露全名的张先生是幸运的。在遭遇严厉盘问并被警告不准再参加抗议后，警察离开了他的公寓。
"He said the ordeal had left him ""terrified,"" and he believed it would be effective at curbing the momentum the gatherings had generated. ""It's going to be very difficult to mobilize people again,"" he said. ""At this point, people are going to get off the streets.""","他说这番遭遇让他十分""害怕""，他也相信此举能有效打击集会产生的势头。""再把人动员起来会非常困难，""他说。""现在这种情况，人们会离开街头的。"""
"For others, their faces gave them away. One man, Mr. Wang, who joined the protests in Beijing, said he received a warning call from the police two days after the Sunday gathering. He was told that he had been identified with facial recognition technology.",还有一些人是因为面孔而暴露身份。参加了北京抗议活动的王先生说，他在周日集会两天后接到了警方的警告电话。他被告知，他已被面部识别技术识别。
"Unlike other Beijing protesters, Mr. Wang did not cover his face with a hat or sunglasses, and he took off his medical mask at one point during the event. He said he wasn't surprised the police had been able to identify him, but the use of such technology made him feel uneasy.",与北京的其他抗议者不同，王先生没有用帽子或太阳镜遮住脸，他在活动中一度摘下了医用口罩。他说，他对警方能够认出他并不感到惊讶，但是这种技术的使用让他感到不安。
"""I knew the risks of going to such a gathering,"" he said. ""If they want to find us, they can definitely succeed.""","""我知道参加这种集会的风险，""他说。""如果他们要找我们，一定找得到。"""
"The phone call from the police lasted only 10 minutes, but the officer did his best to intimidate him: ""He stated clearly that there was no second chance.""","警察打来的电话只持续了10分钟，但警察竭力恐吓他:""他挑明了说下不为例。"""
"After being arrested or approached by the police, many protesters have shied away from using VPNs (virtual private networks) or other foreign apps like Telegram and Signal. The fear, they said, is that now that they are on the authorities' radar, the software they use on their phones might be more closely monitored, leading to more police attention and possible detention.",在被警方逮捕或被找上门后，许多抗议者都避免使用VPN(虚拟私人网络)或其他外国应用程序，如Telegram和Signal。他们说，令人担心的是，既然已经被当局盯上，他们在手机上使用的软件可能会受到更严密的监控，从而招致警方更多的关注，可能还会被拘留。
"One man, who was arrested Monday during a protest in Chengdu in central China, said his phone was checked while he was being held by the police, who saw that he had Telegram and other foreign apps. He deleted the apps when he was released.",周一在成都一场抗议活动中被捕的一名男子说，被警方扣留期间，他的手机遭到检查，警方看到他使用Telegram和其他外国应用。他被释放后删除了这些应用。
"Some protesters have tried to fight back against the surveillance, using tactics similar to those used in Hong Kong in 2019, when demonstrators attempted to reveal the identities of police officers, just as the police worked to unmask them. This week a list of the identities of about 60,000 Shanghai police officers was distributed in some Telegram groups. The spreadsheet of names originated from a leak of Chinese Communist Party members in 2020, according to cybersecurity group Internet 2.0, which researched the original leak. The New York Times confirmed the accuracy of a part of the data, which included officers' national identity numbers, addresses, marriage status, ethnicity and height.",一些抗议者试图反击监控，他们使用的策略与2019年在香港使用的策略类似，当时示威者试图暴露警察的身份，警方则努力揭开抗议者的身份。本周，一份包含约6万名上海警察的身份名单在一些Telegram群组中分发。网络安全组织互联网2.0称，这份名单源于2020年的一次中共党员身份泄露事件，该组织对最初的泄密事件进行了研究。《纽约时报》证实了部分数据的准确性，其中包括警察的身份证号码、地址、婚姻状况、民族和身高。
"For many protesters, the shock of being identified has worked as an intimidation tactic all its own.",对许多抗议者来说，确认身份后的震惊本身就是一种恐吓策略。
"Ms. Wang, a filmmaker in her 20s, said she joined a group of friends in Beijing on Sunday night. Together they took precautions: They covered their faces with medical masks, took a taxi several kilometers away and walked to the site of a vigil. Even though they had been warned to turn off their phones, they instead just disabled the GPS and Face ID features.",20多岁的电影制作人王女士说，她周日晚上在北京和一群朋友在一起。他们采取了预防措施:戴上医用口罩，在几公里外打车，步行到守夜地点。尽管他们被警告要关掉手机，但他们只是关闭了GPS和面容ID功能。
"""We thought at the time, there were so many people. Just think about it, how could they be able to find every one? How could they have the energy to catch every one?"" she said.","""就你想，那么多人，他怎么每个人都找到呢?怎么会有精力每个人都抓住呢?""她说。"
She and her friends were startled when a number of them received phone calls or visits from the police. Some were forced to assist the police with their investigation by going to the station.,当她和一些朋友接到警察的电话或走访时，她们都大吃一惊。一些人被迫去警察局协助警方调查。
"""I think my friends, if there's a next time, they will not dare go,"" she said.","""我觉得我的朋友们，如果下次再有的话，也不会再敢去了，""她说。"
"Still, Ms. Wang slipped through the cracks of the dragnet. That night she used a phone with a number that was not linked to systems that could identify her, like the country's health code software used to track Covid cases and ensure that people regularly get tested in outbreak areas.",尽管如此，王女士还是从天罗地网的缝隙中逃脱了。那天晚上，她使用了另一个手机号码，与能够识别她的系统没有关联，比如该国用于跟踪新冠病例并确保人们在疫情暴发地区定期接受检测的健康码软件。
She was undaunted by her experience.,她没有被自己的经历所吓倒。
"""I'll still go; if the police find me, we'll see,"" she said. When asked about whether she would attend a public gathering again, she added, ""I just feel you have to go.""","""(我)还是会去吧，(警察)找就再说吧再说吧。到那儿再说呗，""她说。当被问及是否会再次参加公众集会时，她补充说，""你就感觉，不去不行吧。"""
"For nearly three years, the Chinese government deployed its considerable propaganda apparatus to fan fears about Covid to justify large-scale quarantines, frequent mass testing and the tracking of more than a billion people. As the authorities now shift their approach to the pandemic, they face the task of downplaying those fears.",近三年来，中国政府在煽动人们对新冠病毒的恐惧上动用了相当大的宣传力量，以证明大规模隔离、频繁的全员核酸检测，以及对10多亿人进行流调追踪的正当性。随着当局现在开始改变应对新冠病毒大流行的做法，政府面临着淡化这种恐惧的任务。
"Until the past week, during which there were rallies voicing extraordinary public opposition to the stringent ""zero Covid"" rules, government officials and state media were still emphasizing the most ominous medical news about the pandemic. There were countless stories about the high death toll suffered elsewhere especially in the United States and about the months of respiratory problems, cognitive impairment and other difficulties associated with long Covid.","直到上周末各地爆发抗议活动，公开反对严格的新冠""清零""政策之前，政府官员和官方媒体一直在强调有关此次疫情最坏的医学消息。还长篇累牍地报道其他地方(尤其是美国)因新冠疫情遭受的大量死亡、长达数月的呼吸系统症状、认知障碍，以及其他与长新冠有关的症状。"
"The official newspaper of the Communist Party, People's Daily, warned on Nov. 15 that any loosening of Covid measures would endanger the lives and health of the Chinese people: ""The relaxation of prevention and control will inevitably increase the risk of infection of susceptible groups.""","中共官方报纸《人民日报》在11月15日仍警告，任何放松防疫措施的做法都将危及中国人民的生命健康:""放松防控势必令易感人群感染风险加大。"""
"Just a week and a half ago, the vice premier overseeing the government's Covid responses, Sun Chunlan, said that ""anyone who should be tested must be tested, and no one should be left behind.""","就在一周半前，主管政府新冠疫情防控工作的副总理孙春兰还说，""应检尽检、不落一人。"""
"But as local governments now hurry to dismantle testing requirements and start hauling away curbside test booths, Ms. Sun changed tack on Wednesday. ""China's pandemic prevention faces a new situation and new tasks, given the weakening severity of the Omicron variant,"" she said.","但随着地方政府现在急着取消核酸检测要求，开始拆除路边的临时检测点，孙春兰上周三改变了说法。""随着奥密克戎病毒致病性的减弱，我国疫情防控面临新形势新任务，""她说。"
"China faces a challenging moment in its pandemic response, experts say, in large part because of muddled messaging. The government has failed to take many proven public health measures, such as aggressive campaigns for full vaccination, leaving many citizens of the world's most populous nation at risk.",专家们表示，中国在遏制新冠病毒大流行的响应上面临着一个充满挑战的时刻，这在很大程度上是政府传递信息的混乱造成的。政府未能采取许多行之有效的公共卫生措施，例如积极推动全员接种疫苗，使得这个世界上人口最多的国家里有许多民众可能受到伤害。
"China's top leader, Xi Jinping, had personally affirmed that sacrifices were needed to stop the spread of Covid. ""It would be better to temporarily affect a little the development of the economy than to let the people's life, safety and health be harmed,"" he said in June.","中国最高领导人习近平本人曾断言，社会需要为阻止新冠病毒传播做出牺牲。""宁可暂时影响一点经济发展，也不能让人民群众生命安全和身体健康受到伤害，""他曾在今年6月这样说。"
"Beijing is now rapidly moving to lighten the burden of Covid restrictions. Some neighborhood committees are beginning to let residents stay home if they or their family members are infected, instead of transporting them to makeshift hospitals, vast stadiums or long rows of shipping containers, standard procedure since the early months of the pandemic. Chengdu, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Beijing, Chongqing and Shenzhen have all lifted requirements in the past several days for residents to show negative Covid tests before taking the subway or entering other public places.","中国政府现在正在为减轻""清零""的负担迅速采取行动。一些社区居委会已开始允许感染的居民在自家隔离，而不是将他们转运到在大型体育场馆或用成排集装箱临时搭建的方舱医院，这曾是疫情暴发最初几个月来的标准做法。过去几天里，成都、广州、天津、北京、重庆和深圳都已取消了要求居民乘坐地铁或进入许多公共场所必须出示核酸检测阴性证明的做法。"
"Yet allaying Covid worries bordering on terror among millions of people, particularly older residents, is proving a challenge for the Communist Party and state media. Further complicating matters is that China's leaders have a long history of not wanting to look as though they are reversing policies because of public anger.",然而，事实证明，要减轻数百万人(尤其是老年人)对新冠病毒近乎恐惧的担忧对中共和官媒来说是一项挑战。让这项工作更复杂的是，中国领导人长期以来一直都不想让自己看来像是因公众愤怒改变了政策。
"Throughout the government's unbending response, the country has struggled to adequately vaccinate some of its most vulnerable: Of people ages 80 and older, two-thirds have done the initial course of vaccinations, usually two doses, but only 40 percent have received a booster dose.",在政府固执地坚持清零时，中国一直在为一些最脆弱的人群充分接种疫苗方面举步维艰:虽然国内80岁及以上的人群中，三分之二的人已完成了最初的(通常是两剂的)疫苗接种，但只有40%的人打了加强针。
International scientists say that three of China's vaccines are needed to achieve protection comparable to two mRNA vaccines in the West.,国际上的科学家们表示，需要打三针中国国产疫苗，才能达到相当于两针西方mRNA疫苗的保护效力。
Missing from the state media's new reporting about Covid has been any mention of the recent days' protests. The coverage has shifted to research by Chinese scientists that the Omicron variant may not be as dangerous as earlier versions of the virus.,中国官媒关于新冠的报道没有提及最近几天的抗议活动。官媒的报道已转向中国科学家对奥密克戎变异株致病性可能不像新冠病毒原始株和以前的变异株那么危险的研究。
"Southern Daily, a state-controlled newspaper in Guangzhou, published on Saturday a report emphasizing a municipal estimate that 90 percent of Omicron infections were asymptomatic. Citing interviews with seven leading Guangzhou doctors, the newspaper also reassured readers that symptomatic cases were seldom serious, except among elderly, unvaccinated residents.",广州的官方报纸《南方日报》上周六发了一篇报道，强调了该市90%的奥密克戎变异株感染者没有症状的估计数字。报道引用对广州七位知名医生的采访向读者保证，有症状的感染者中很少出现重症，除非是未接种疫苗的老年人。
"Many other countries have found Omicron to be less deadly but more infectious. There have been nearly 7 million confirmed deaths of Covid worldwide, while China says that it has suffered just over 5,000 deaths.",世界许多其他地方早已发现，奥密克戎变异株的致死率低，但传染性更强。全球已确认有近700万人死于新冠病毒，而中国公布的新冠病毒死亡人数仅略高于5000。
"On Thursday, Global Times, another Communist Party publication, quoted a doctor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou who questioned the existence of long Covid, a complex cluster of post-infection symptoms, sometimes debilitating, that has been chronicled extensively by U.S. government epidemiologists.","上周四，另一份中共出版物《环球时报》引用广州中山大学一名医生的话说，被一些学者称为""长新冠""的临床表现""尚不能归类为'新冠肺炎的后遗症'""。长新冠指的是感染新冠病毒后长时间持续的复杂临床症状，有时表现为虚弱，美国政府的流行病学家已对其有广泛的记录。"
"""There are no confirmed sequelae of Covid-19,"" said Dr. Chong Yutian, using a medical term for lingering consequences after an infection or injury. Dr. Chong did not respond to a request for comment.","""至少尚没有证据表明有后遗症，""崇雨田说，他用的医学术语后遗症指的是，""在恢复期结束后，某些器官的功能长期未能恢复正常。""崇雨田没有回复记者的置评请求。"
"Guiding public opinion in a new direction will not be easy for China, because state media had effectively suppressed any suggestion that Covid might be manageable.",将中国的公众舆论引向新的方向并非易事，因为官媒曾有效地压制了任何有关新冠病毒疾病也许可控的暗示。
"""Until recently the experts were all geared to supporting the policy against Covid,"" said Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. ""The media is suddenly going all the way in the direction that the virus has mutated and is less pathogenic.""","""直到最近，国内专家们给出的说法都是支持政府新冠清零政策的，""芝加哥大学政治学家杨大利说。""媒体突然来了个180度大转弯，全面转向病毒已经变异、致病性减弱的说法。"""
"Better communication, including on the importance of vaccination, is essential for China to manage its emergence from Covid restrictions, said Jin Dongyan, a Hong Kong University virologist. Many in China are still so afraid of the virus that they may stay home from even grocery stores as the country begins to open up, which could cause further economic harm, he warned.",香港大学病毒学家金冬雁说，更好的沟通，包括传播接种疫苗的重要性对中国设法从新冠清零中走出来至关重要。他警告，中国仍有许多人非常害怕新冠病毒，随着国家开始开放，他们甚至可能不敢出门买菜，这可能会给经济带来进一步的损害。
"""To educate the general public is really important, and that's what they need to strengthen, because right now the public is confused and divided,"" he said.","""教育公众真的很重要，这是政府需要加强的，因为现在公众对新冠病毒的认识存在困惑和分歧，""他说。"
"Jiang Sigui, 60, a corn farmer in Guangxi, an impoverished region in southernmost China, said that he worried that the easing of ""zero Covid"" restrictions would lead to a wave of infections that could overwhelm rural villages like his, with limited health care facilities. He fears for his ability to continue raising his grandchildren if he falls ill.","广西省属于中国贫困地区，当地一名60岁的玉米种植农姜思贵(音)说，他担心放松""清零""限制会导致一波感染潮，可能会让像他所在的这种农村地区不堪重负，那里的医疗条件有限。如果他感染了新冠病毒，他担心无法继续照看孙辈。"
"""I support the fight against Covid,"" he said. ""Right now, I'm at home, raising children. I definitely worry about the virus who doesn't?""","""我支持抗疫，""他说。""我现在在家带孩子。我当然担心这个病毒，谁会不担心?"""
Yet many young and middle-aged residents of China do appear to be less afraid of Covid than they are troubled by the restrictions that China has imposed to control its spread. That sentiment became apparent in the recent protests.,不过，中国有许多年轻人和中年人对新冠病毒的担忧似乎确实已低于他们对新冠清零困扰的担忧。这种情绪在最近的抗议活动中已变得明显。
"China has halted almost all international travel during the pandemic and wields ever stricter censorship of the internet, including an almost complete block on access to foreign websites. Many of the protests took place in coastal provinces where residents often have the internet tools to see overseas websites that show them how the rest of the world has adjusted to life with Covid.",中国在新冠病毒大流行开始后几乎停止了所有国际旅行，并对互联网进行更加严格的审查，包括几乎完全封锁了访问外国网站的渠道。许多抗议活动发生在沿海省份，那里的居民常常知道怎么使用互联网工具上海外网站，看到了世界其他地方已适应与新冠病毒共存。
"Yet interviews with people in Lanzhou, a provincial capital in western China, indicate that a desire for a shift in Covid policy has reached China's huge interior as well.",不过，在中国西部省会城市兰州进行的采访表明，改变清零政策的愿望也传到了中国广阔的内陆地区。
"Zhang Zechen, a 20-year-old university student, said that she had been confined to her dorm under lockdown for much of the past semester. The university required her to have a PCR test every fourth day. When the university offered students the chance to leave a month early for Lunar New Year celebrations, to reduce the risk of transmission, she jumped at the chance.",现年20岁的大学生张泽臣(音)说，她在这学期的大部分时间一直被关在宿舍里。校方要求她每四天做一次核酸检测。当校方为了减少感染风险，让学生提前一个月放寒假后，她抓紧机会离开了校园。
"""I felt tired of PCR testing,"" Ms. Zhang said. ""Everyone feels stir crazy.""","""我感觉很累""，""张女士说。""大家都憋疯了。"""
"A 24-year-old migrant worker said that he was infected with Covid last September while working in Tibet, but found that the only symptoms of his illness were a few days of coughing. He was critical of policies like locking residents in their homes for weeks, sometimes corralling more than a million people, after even a handful of cases.",一名24岁的农民工说，他去年9月在西藏工作时感染过新冠病毒，但发现他的症状只是几天咳嗽。他批评了政府的一些政策，例如将居民封在家中好几周，有时只因为发现了少数阳性者，就不让上百万人出家门。
"""A lockdown should never be expanded to a whole district, affecting people's normal travel and work,"" said the worker, who gave only his family name, Ma, in discussing his personal health.","""封控不应该封整个区，影响大家正常出行和工作，""这位只称自己姓马的工人在谈及他的个人健康时说。"
"Yet even as China adopts a more reassuring stance about the dangers of Covid, many experts urge caution. They contend that the government has not yet done enough to vaccinate the elderly, prepare hospitals and educate the public.",尽管中国正在设法打消人们对新冠病毒的担忧，但许多专家敦促谨慎行事。他们认为，政府在为老年人接种疫苗、让医院做好准备，以及在教育公众方面做得还不够。
"""If they unroll all the restrictions too quickly, it's probably going to lead to a large number of cases and economic disruptions,"" said Andy Chen, a public health analyst in the Shanghai office of Trivium China, a consulting firm.","""如果他们过快地解除所有限制，可能会导致大量感染病例，扰乱经济，""咨询公司策纬驻上海的公共卫生分析师陈昕然说。"
"As one country after another succumbed to outbreaks this year, China kept the coronavirus at bay, buying valuable time to prepare for the inevitable: a variant of the virus so shifty and contagious that China, too, would struggle to contain it.",今年，随着一个又一个国家相继屈服于疫情，中国仍控制着新冠病毒，赢得了宝贵的时间来应对不可避免的灾难:病毒的变异株变得极为狡猾、传染性极强，以至于中国也将难以控制它。
"But rather than laying the groundwork for that scenario, China stepped up its commitment to ""zero Covid,"" deploying snap lockdowns and contact tracing.","但中国没有为这种情况奠定基础，而是加强了对""清零""的承诺，部署了快速封锁和接触者追踪。"
"In the meantime, daily vaccinations fell to record lows. Critical-care beds remained in short supply, even as workers built testing booths and isolation facilities. Research on homegrown mRNA vaccines failed to keep up with the fast-mutating virus.",与此同时，每日疫苗接种量降至历史最低水平。尽管工作人员建造了检测室和隔离设施，重症监护床位仍然短缺。国产mRNA疫苗的研究未能跟上快速变异的病毒。
"Now, the costs of that approach are piling up, putting China in a bind from which there appears to be no easy escape, scientists said in interviews.",科学家们在接受采访时表示，如今，这种做法的代价正在不断增加，使中国陷入似乎无法轻易摆脱的困境。
"Even as new Covid cases have reached all-time highs, residents have taken to the streets to protest lockdowns that have ground daily life to a halt in many cities. Alarmed, officials have begun easing restrictions.",尽管新冠病例达到历史新高，但居民们走上街头，抗议导致许多城市日常生活陷于停顿的封锁。震惊的官员开始放松限制。
Researchers worry that China may struggle to reopen the country and relieve the strain on its economy without risking a tide of deaths. Such a catastrophic surge could pose a significant threat to the political leadership.,研究人员担心，中国可能很难在不出现死亡潮风险的情况下重新开放，缓解经济压力。这种灾难性的激增可能对政治领导人构成重大威胁。。
"""We often pretend that China has a choice in terms of 'zero Covid' versus opening up,"" said Dr. Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. ""There never was a choice. The simple fact is that China is not ready for a wave on that scale.""","""我们经常假装中国可以在'清零'和开放之间做出选择，""香港大学病毒学家斯达斯·斯达尔博士说:""从来没有过选择。一个简单的事实是，中国还没有准备好迎接这种规模的浪潮。"""
"Nothing has set back China's preparations as extensively as its difficulty in vaccinating older people. Two-thirds of people ages 80 and older are vaccinated, but only 40 percent have received a booster dose, a critical shortcoming because Chinese-made vaccines offer weaker protection than the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.",为老年人接种疫苗的困难是中国准备工作中最严重的阻碍。在80岁及以上的人群中，有三分之二的人接种了疫苗，但只有40%的人接种了强化针，这是一个严重的缺陷，因为中国生产的疫苗比辉瑞和莫德纳疫苗提供的保护作用更弱。
"In a study during Hong Kong's Omicron surge, two doses of China's main domestic vaccine, Sinovac, were only 58 percent effective against severe Covid or death in people ages 80 and older. Two Pfizer-BioNTech doses, by contrast, were 87 percent effective in the same group. An earlier study in Brazil similarly found that two Sinovac doses were only 61 percent effective in preventing Covid deaths.",在香港奥密克戎病毒激增期间的一项研究中，中国主要国产疫苗科兴的两剂疫苗对80岁及以上人群的新冠重症或死亡的有效性只有58%。相比之下，两剂辉瑞疫苗对同一群体的有效性为87%。巴西的一项早期研究也发现，两剂科兴疫苗在预防新冠死亡方面的有效性只有61%。
"Those results have cemented an impression among scientists that the Chinese shots, which rely on killed viruses to prompt an immune response, are effectively a three-dose, rather than a two-dose, vaccine.",这些结果在科学家中巩固了一种印象，即中国的灭活疫苗是三针有效，而不是两针。
"Making matters more difficult, China's last major vaccination push was in the spring, an interval of eight months or more since the last dose for many recipients.",更加困难的是，中国上一次大规模的疫苗接种是在春季，对于许多接种者来说，距离上一次接种间隔了八个月或更长时间。
"That could put a dent in their immune defenses. A study in Malaysia found that while the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine elicited relatively steady protection against intensive-care admissions three to five months later, the effectiveness of the Sinovac vaccine against intensive-care admissions fell to 29 percent from 56 percent over that period.",这会削弱他们的免疫防御系统。马来西亚的一项研究发现，虽然辉瑞疫苗在三到五个月后对重症监护住院产生了相对稳定的保护作用，但科兴疫苗在同一时期对重症监护住院的有效性从56%下降到29%。
"The Chinese vaccines stack up relatively well against the world's other non-mRNA Covid shots, said Dr. Paul Hunter, an infectious disease specialist at the University of East Anglia in England. But reopening the country so long after the last vaccination campaign could be damaging.",英国东安格利亚大学传染病专家保罗·亨特博士说，与世界上其他非mRNA的新冠疫苗相比，中国疫苗的表现相对较好。但是在上次疫苗接种运动结束这么久之后重新开放国家可能是有害的。
"""I think that's more of an issue than the quality"" of China's vaccines, Dr. Hunter said.","亨特说，""我认为这是一个比(中国疫苗的)质量更大的问题""。"
"The vaccination gaps in China's older population are all the more glaring because the country has achieved relatively strong coverage overall. Nearly 90 percent of the population has received a primary vaccine series, generally comprising two doses of Sinovac or Sinopharm, another Chinese-made shot.",由于中国已经实现了相对较高的总体覆盖率，中国老年人口的疫苗接种差距更加明显。近90%的人口已经接种了最初的疫苗，通常包括两剂科兴或国药控股的疫苗，后者是另一种中国制造的疫苗。
"The disparity results in part from an outdated theory that so long as younger and more active Chinese were immunized, the country could establish a sort of herd immunity and protect older people, said Andy Chen, a Shanghai-based analyst at Trivium, a consulting firm.",咨询公司Trivium驻上海的分析师安迪·陈(音)说，造成这种差异的部分原因是一种过时的理论，即只要更年轻、更活跃的中国人接种疫苗，国家就可以建立一种群体免疫，保护老年人。
"Older people in China often avoid health risks, Mr. Chen said, and so the chances of even minor vaccine side effects may have seemed threatening to many. China's reluctance to provide data on the efficacy and side effects of its vaccines created a vacuum in which those worries flourished, other experts said. Misinformation about side effects spread on Chinese social media.",安迪·陈说，中国的老年人通常会避免健康风险，因此，对许多人来说，即使是轻微的疫苗副作用，也可能是一种威胁。其他专家说，中国不愿提供疫苗功效和副作用的数据，这造成了一个真空，使这些担忧变得更加严重。有关副作用的错误信息在中国社交媒体上大量传播。
"And while health officials have encouraged older adults with chronic illnesses to get shots, vaccinators are often reluctant to administer them without access to the medical histories of more vulnerable recipients.",尽管卫生官员鼓励患有慢性疾病的老年人接种疫苗，但疫苗接种人员往往不愿意在没有获得更脆弱接种者病史的情况下接种疫苗。
"The ""zero Covid"" strategy only complicated the vaccination drive. By limiting infections, it saved lives but also eroded many older people's sense of urgency about the need for a shot.","""清零""战略只会使疫苗接种复杂化。限制感染措施挽救了生命，但也削弱了许多老年人对于注射疫苗的紧迫感。"
"An emphasis on swabbing throats instead of administering shots drew further attention from the vaccination campaign. In the aftermath of a springtime surge, China erected tens of thousands of testing booths in cities like Shanghai and Beijing and built huge facilities to isolate millions. The vaccination rate stagnated.",强调核酸检测而不是注射疫苗的做法进一步分散了人们对疫苗接种的关注。在春季疫情暴发后，中国在上海和北京等城市设立了数以万计的检测点，并建造了巨大的设施来隔离数百万人。疫苗接种率停滞不前。
"""There is always a shortage of staff members in the health care system,"" said Xi Chen, an associate professor of public health at Yale University. ""People told me at the time they were told to focus on mass testing.""","""医疗系统的工作人员总是短缺，""耶鲁大学公共卫生副教授陈曦(音)说，""人们当时告诉我，他们被告知要专注于大规模检测。"""
"China said this week that it would renew efforts to vaccinate its oldest citizens, announcing measures to use mobile vaccination stations, bring shots into nursing homes and go door-to-door to reach the most vulnerable, according to a statement from the country's National Health Commission.",根据中国国家卫生健康委员会的一份声明，中国本周表示，将继续努力为最年长的公民接种疫苗，宣布采取措施，使用流动疫苗接种站，将疫苗送到养老院，走访上门。
"But some experts, like Yanzhong Huang, a global health specialist and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, expressed skepticism that the move was much more than lip service.",但一些专家，比如全球卫生专家、外交关系委员会高级研究员黄严忠怀疑此举只是口惠而实不至。
"""It is about tinkering with the current approach,"" he said. ""But that approach fundamentally doesn't make any sense from a public health policy perspective anymore.""","""这是对当前方法的修补，""他说。""但从公共卫生政策的角度来看，这种做法从根本上已经没有任何意义了。"""
"The authorities did not provide a detailed plan for the new efforts and stopped short of mandating vaccinations. As powerful as the country's leadership is, forcing older people to get shots is seen as a potential overreach, experts said, bringing with it the risk of a public backlash.",在与卫生官员举行的新闻发布会上，当局没有提供新举措的详细计划，也没有强制要求接种疫苗。专家们表示，尽管领导层掌握着巨大的权力，但强迫老年人接种疫苗被视为一种潜在的越权行为，可能会引发公众的反感。
"""From a local government official's perspective, if even just one person dies from the adverse effects of vaccines, that's blood on your hands,"" said Mr. Chen, the Trivium analyst. ""It's really hard to recover from that.""","""从地方政府官员的角度来看，即使只有一个人死于疫苗的不良影响，那也是你手上的血债，""Trivium的分析师安迪·陈说。""真的很难从中恢复。"""
"If cases keep climbing, gaps in vaccine coverage could pile more pressure on hospitals that may also need to confront a winter cold and flu season. China has fewer intensive care beds per capita than many other Asian countries.",如果病例继续攀升，疫苗覆盖率的差距可能会给医院带来更大的压力，这些医院可能还需要应对冬季感冒和流感季节。中国的人均重症监护床位少于许多其他亚洲国家。
"The country once dealt with shortages of doctors and nurses, especially in rural areas, by moving health workers from one province to another when the virus flared up. A nationwide torrent of Omicron infections would make that impossible.",中共曾在疫情暴发时将卫生工作者从一个省份转移到另一个省份，以应对医生和护士短缺的问题，特别是在农村地区。如果奥密克戎病毒在全国范围内泛滥，那样做就不可能了。
"A study from Shanghai's Fudan University in May warned of a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases and roughly 1.6 million deaths if China abandoned its ""zero Covid"" policy. China has since acquired more options for antiviral treatments. But its hospital capacity is limited enough that a sudden lifting of ""zero Covid"" restrictions would still create a health crisis, said Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.","上海复旦大学今年5月的一项研究警告称，如果中国放弃""清零""政策，将出现一场新冠病例的""海啸""，约160万人死亡。自那以后，中国获得了更多抗病毒治疗的选择。但香港大学流行病学教授本·考林表示，中国的医院能力非常有限，突然取消""清零""限制仍然会造成健康危机。"
"Given the inevitability that cases will surge whenever China reopens, Yang Yang, an associate professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, said that efforts ""to prepare the medical system"" were a priority. Already there are some signs that the leadership is shifting focus from building quarantine facilities to fortifying its best hospitals, he added.","佛罗里达大学生物统计学副教授杨洋(音)表示，鉴于中国一旦重新开放，病例将不可避免地激增，""为医疗系统做好准备""是当务之急。他还说，已经有一些迹象表明，领导层正在将重点从建设隔离设施转移到巩固其最好的医院。"
"China's floundering retreat from the emergency phase of the pandemic contrasts with the exits made by places like New Zealand and Taiwan. There, lockdowns brought breathing room while the population was being vaccinated; when the measures were lifted, deaths surged, but to levels far lower than in countries like the United States.",中国笨拙地退出大流行紧急阶段，与新西兰和台湾等地的退出形成鲜明对比。后者用封锁争取了喘息之机，让人口有时间接种疫苗;随着防疫措施的解除，死亡上升了，但上升幅度远不像美国这样的国家那么大。
"China's strategy so far has limited Covid deaths, too, scientists said, but without also mapping an exit from restrictions.",科学家表示，中国的策略到目前为止也限制了新冠死亡规模，但没能规划出一个退出封锁措施的途径。
"""Restrictions and lockdowns can help buy time to get crucial public health measures in place and save lives, but they are not an exit strategy by themselves,"" said Jeremy Farrar, the director of Wellcome, a global health foundation.","""限制和封锁只能用来争取时间，以便让关键公共卫生措施就位，拯救生命，但是他们没有自己的退出策略，""全球卫生基金会惠康的总监杰瑞米·法拉说。"
"China, which has spurned the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, appears to be leaning on hopes for locally made mRNA alternatives. Government scientists have been running a head-to-head trial of more than a dozen new vaccine candidates, including some mRNA doses, experts said.",至今没有接受辉瑞和莫德纳疫苗的中国似乎把希望寄托在本国生产的mRNA替代品上。专家说，政府的科学家正在同时测试十多种新疫苗，其中包括一些mRNA疫苗。
"Public data is sparse, but Indonesia recently authorized China's mRNA shot, and some vaccine makers appear to be moving closer to seeking authorization from Chinese officials.",公开数据十分稀少，不过印度尼西亚近日批准了中国的mRNA疫苗，其中一些疫苗生产商在获得中国官方批准方面似乎走在前面。
"""The formulation of getting an mRNA vaccine correct might have taken a few shots on goal, but early data suggests it's heading in the right direction,"" said James Bellush, a medical science expert at RTW Investments in New York.","""在研发mRNA疫苗方面可能已经做了一些尝试，但初步数据显示正走在正确方向，""纽约RTW投资公司医疗科学专家詹姆斯·贝尔拉什说。"
"China's top leadership has signaled a recognition that its blanket approach to controlling the virus is taking an increasingly large economic and social toll, calling for measures to adjust what has been a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. In recent days, several cities have loosened some of their harshest restrictions following a wave of mass protests.","中国最高领导层释放的信号显示，他们看到为了控制病毒而采取的全面措施正在造成越来越大的经济和社会损耗，并呼吁对""一刀切""的方式做出调整。近日经过一波大规模抗议后，有多座城市放松了最严厉的限制措施。"
"But there still seemed to be some debate about whether backing down from Covid restrictions was the right approach. In the northeastern city of Jinzhou, in China's Liaoning province, officials said that they had already begun to loosen some measures but still pushed back on deserting the ""zero Covid"" strategy.","但是，是否应该放弃新冠防疫限制，似乎还存在争论。在东北省份辽宁的锦州市，官员们表示已经开始放松一些措施，但仍然抵制彻底放弃""清零""政策。"
"""There's no need for us to abandon our defenses when we can reach zero, avoiding large-scale infections,"" officials said.","他们说，""我们没有必要在可以清零、可以不形成大面积感染的情况下放弃防守。"""
"In the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, residents returned to work on Thursday for the first time in weeks after Covid-19 lockdowns were lifted. In Chongqing, in the southwest, some residents were no longer required to take regular Covid tests. And in Beijing, a senior health official played down the severity of current Omicron variants, a rare move for the government.",周四，在中国南方城市广州，解封后的居民数周以来首次返回工作岗位。在西南城市重庆，部分居民无需再定期接受新冠检测。在北京，一位高级卫生官员淡化了当前传播的奥密克戎变异株的严重性，这对政府来说是罕见之举。
The developments suggest that the ruling Communist Party may be starting to back down on unpopular Covid restrictions in response to a wave of mass protests that have been the most widespread challenge to Beijing in decades.,这些进展表明，面对数十年来对北京构成最广泛挑战的大规模抗议浪潮，执政的共产党可能开始放弃不受欢迎的防疫措施。
"When protesters rallied in a dozen cities over the past weekend, fueled by anger over the country's strict lockdowns, Beijing initially responded with security measures focused on rounding up protesters and deterring others from taking part in gatherings. Now the party is also, to some extent and in some places, signaling a willingness to address the root cause of the public anger: intrusive pandemic controls that have stifled economic growth, left millions of people confined in their homes for long stretches and set off violent clashes as recently as this week.",出于对国家严格封城措施的愤怒，十几座城市的抗议者在上周末举行集会抗议。北京起初的应对办法是动用安全手段，重点围捕抗议者，并阻止其他人参加集会。如今，在某种程度上以及在某些地方，党表明了态度，愿意疏解公愤的根源所在:侵犯式的防疫抑制了经济增长，导致无数人长期被困家中，点燃了直到本周还在发生的暴力冲突。
"The party has still not publicly acknowledged the widespread demonstrations against lockdowns, but top security officials have warned that the authorities would crack down on ""criminal acts that disrupt social order."" The policing measures have mostly muted the protests for now, but the need to tamp down public discontent has grown more urgent with the death of Jiang Zemin, a former president, whose passing on Wednesday could inspire more people to demonstrate against the government.","中共仍未对反封锁的大规模示威活动表态，但高级安全官员警告，当局将坚决打击""扰乱社会秩序的违法犯罪行为""。目前警方已经基本平息了抗议，但前国家主席江泽民周三去世可能激发更多民众举行反政府示威，压制公众不满的需求变得更加迫切。"
"Easing China's exceptionally stringent Covid measures could help assuage public anger. But it is unclear how far the party would be willing to go or if any such shift is being led by Xi Jinping, China's leader, who has been the chief enforcer of the country's ""zero Covid"" policy. Mr. Xi has staked the party's legitimacy on controlling the virus better than other countries, especially its geopolitical rivals in the West, and any reversal or abandonment of the policy could undercut his authority.","放宽极度严格的防疫措施可能有助于缓解民愤。但目前尚不清楚中共愿意放宽到何种程度，也不清楚此类转变是否由国家领导人习近平主导，他一直都是中国新冠""清零""政策的最高指挥者。习近平把中共的执政合法性押在了中国能比其他国家——特别是西方的地缘政治对手——更好地控制病毒之上，任何政策上的逆转或废弃都可能削弱他的权威。"
"Even as Sun Chunlan, the vice premier overseeing pandemic efforts, acknowledged this week that the danger that Omicron variants posed was waning, lockdowns continued to be in place in many parts of the country. At least one city in the country's northeast, Jinzhou, said on Thursday that it planned to maintain lockdowns for several more days because ""it would be a shame not to eradicate cases if they can be eradicated!""","即便负责防疫工作的副总理孙春兰本周承认奥密克戎变异株所带来的危险正在减弱，中国许多地方仍在继续实施封锁。至少，东北城市锦州周四宣称，准备继续封城一段时间，因为""能清零而不清零，实在是太可惜了""。"
"The pushback from places like Jinzhou points to the challenge that Beijing might face in trying to unwind the heavy-handed approach that had until just this week seemed immovable. In Ms. Sun's remarks to health officials, carried by the state media, even the phrase the party uses to describe its policy, ""dynamic zero Covid,"" was notably absent.","锦州等地的抵制说明，在试图放松直到本周还看似无可动摇的强硬做法时，北京可能面临挑战。在官媒在报道孙春兰对卫生官员的讲话时，只字未提""动态清零""的说法，这引发了关注。"
"Speaking at a symposium at the National Health Commission on Thursday, Ms. Sun said for the second time in two days that the country was entering a new phase in its campaign against the virus.",周四，在国家卫健委座谈会上，孙春兰连续第二天强调称，中国的疫情防控正在进入新阶段。
"""After three years fighting against Covid, our medical and disease control system has met the challenge,"" Ms. Sun said. ""The public's sense of health has increased significantly.""","""经过近三年的抗疫，我国医疗卫生和疾控体系经受住了考验，""孙春兰说。""群众的健康意识和素养明显提升。"""
"""China's pandemic prevention faces a new situation and new tasks given the weakening severity of the Omicron variant,"" Ms. Sun had noted on Wednesday during a meeting in which she at times did not wear a mask. She added that China must take ""small but unwavering steps"" to optimize its controls.","""随着奥密克戎病毒致病性的减弱，我国疫情防控面临新形势新任务，""孙春兰在周三的会议上说，当时她没有戴口罩。她还表示，中国要""走小步不停步""，优化完善防控政策。"
"Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said the developments particularly Ms. Sun's comments were some of the strongest indications yet that China would alter its approach after years of intractability.",香港大学病毒学家金冬雁表示，这些进展——特别是孙春兰的讲话——堪称迄今为止最明确的迹象，表明中国在顽固坚守之后终于愿意变通。
"""Change could be imminent. They're moving in the right direction, but they're not there yet,"" said Mr. Jin, who added that China still had work to do dispelling misinformation about the severity of Covid and the side effects of vaccines.","金冬雁表示，""改变可能迫在眉睫。他们正在朝着正确的方向前进，但还没到成功的地步。""他还说，在消除关于新冠疫情严重性和疫苗副作用的虚假信息方面，中国仍有许多工作要做。"
"""Many small steps could lead to a big difference,"" Mr. Jin said.","""许多个一小步可能会带来大不同，""金冬雁说。"
"After officials announced an easing of Covid restrictions in Guangzhou, a city of 19 million people, lockdowns were lifted in at least four districts. Before the start of a news conference on Wednesday, officials unhooked their masks in quick succession, a staged gesture that deviated from past Covid-19 protocols. But restrictions were still in place for neighborhoods considered ""high risk,"" where Covid cases have been reported.","在有1900万人口的广州，官方宣布放松管控措施后，至少有四个城区解除了封锁。在周三的新闻发布会之前，官员们陆续摘下口罩，这是与以往防疫规定背道而驰的姿态。但对报告了新冠病例、被判定为""高风险""的社区，限制依然存在。"
"Guangzhou has come under immense scrutiny after residents forcefully resisted being confined in their homes, restrictions that, in some cases, were to last for as long as a month. This week, hundreds of migrant workers in the district of Haizhu, a hub for garment production, tore down barriers and hurled glass bottles at riot police officers after weeks of going without work and seeing their food supplies dwindle.",因居民激烈抵制被封在家里，广州受到了巨大关注，其封锁措施在某些情况下长达一月之久。本周，服装生产中心海珠区的数百名外来务工者因为持续数周无法工作，眼看着食物供应减少，他们拆除障碍物，向防暴警察投掷玻璃瓶。
"Some residents went into work for the first time in a month after rules were eased. Others reveled in the simple joy of dining in a restaurant. ""It's good to be back to normal again,"" said Faye Luo, 30, a sales manager at a technology start-up in Guangzhou who returned to her office on Thursday. ""This time, I hope normal life can last a little longer.""","政策放松后，一些居民一个月来首次上班。还有一些人沉浸在下馆子堂食的简单快乐中。""回到正常生活很好，""广州一家科技初创企业的销售经理、30岁的菲·罗(音)周四回到办公室时说。""这次我希望正常生活能持续久一些。"""
"In Chongqing, officials announced measures to limit testing requirements and prevent lockdowns from being extended beyond high-risk areas. Several other cities, including Beijing and the northern city of Shijiazhuang, modified testing requirements and announced that malls and supermarkets would reopen.",在重庆，官员们宣布了限制检测要求的措施，并防止封锁扩大到高风险地区以外。北京和石家庄等城市修改了检测要求，并宣布商场和超市将重新开业。
"On Thursday, reports of the rollback of controls in some places spread across social media feeds and chat groups on WeChat, China's most popular messaging app, and were met with a measure of optimism.",周四，在社交媒体和中国最受欢迎的通讯应用微信的聊天群里有很多关于各地取消管控的消息，它们得到了一定程度的乐观回应。
"""We were all very happy last night,"" said one protester from Shanghai who asked to be identified only by her surname Zhang for fear of official reprisals. ""We started to picture how life would be after the whole country's restrictions are loosened.""","""昨晚我们都很高兴，""一名来自上海的抗议者表示。由于担心遭到官方报复，她要求只透露自己姓张。""我们开始想象全国放开限制后的生活会是什么样子。"""
"Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, cautioned that without proper planning, any sudden shift away from ""zero Covid"" could create a crisis of mass infections, overwhelming hospitals, if local officials and ordinary residents interpreted Ms. Sun's comments to mean that they can too quickly lower their guard.","对外关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠警告，如果地方官员和普通居民将孙春兰的言论解读为可以过快放松警惕，在没有适当规划的情况下，任何突然偏离""清零""的转变都可能导致大规模感染危机，令医院不堪重负。"
"""In the absence of a road map for an orderly transition, her remarks might trigger unintended responses at the local level that make a rapid, nationwide surge of cases more likely,"" said Mr. Huang, who has called for China to adopt a more flexible Covid policy.","""在没有一个有序过渡的路线图的情况下，她的言论可能会在地方层面引发意想不到的反应，从而更有可能在全国范围内迅速出现病例激增，""黄严忠说。他呼吁中国采取更灵活的新冠政策。"
"Lifting China's stringent Covid measures was always going to be difficult for both public health and political reasons. China's population of older adults is not sufficiently vaccinated to withstand a major outbreak, and the country's health infrastructure is still largely underdeveloped, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas.",出于公共卫生和政治原因，解除中国严格的新冠措施不会是一件容易的事情。中国的老年人接种率偏低，无法抵御大规模疫情，而且中国的卫生基础设施在相当程度上还不发达，尤其是在小城镇和农村地区。
"Last month, the authorities announced rules to limit the scope of lockdowns and relax quarantines for close contacts of infected people. But met with a wave of subsequent outbreaks, many local governments returned to strict lockdowns, contributing to the protesters' frustrations.",上个月，当局宣布了限制封锁范围的规定，并放宽了对感染者密切接触者的隔离。但由于随后暴发了一波疫情，许多地方政府恢复了严格的封锁，加剧了抗议者的不满情绪。
"Perhaps more important, Mr. Xi has touted his ""zero Covid"" policy as an example of China's global superiority while other countries, especially Western developed nations, experienced hundreds of thousands of deaths from the virus. Abandoning the policy outright would undermine Mr. Xi's image of infallibility as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.","也许更重要的是，习近平把他的""清零""政策作为中国全球优势的一个例子，而其他国家，特别是西方发达国家，有数十万人死于病毒。彻底放弃这一政策将破坏习近平作为毛泽东以来中国最强大领导人的无懈可击形象。"
"Yet the protests, which seemed unthinkable just days ago in a country where dissent is smothered by censorship and surveillance, have highlighted the risks of maintaining the policy indefinitely. Dissatisfaction over Covid measures can quickly spiral into deeper grievances about how extensively the party under Mr. Xi has inserted itself into daily life and asserted its control over society.",然而，在一个不同意见被审查和监视所窒息的国家，几天前似乎还无法想象的抗议活动凸显了无限期维持这一政策的风险。对新冠措施的不满会迅速发酵，演化为对习近平领导下的中共广泛介入日常生活、管控社会的不满。
"Given the shrinking space for expression in China, the authorities will also watch carefully to make sure protesters don't seize on Mr. Jiang's death to recapture momentum. In 1989, the death of Hu Yaobang, a liberal-leaning Chinese leader, gave rise to student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.",鉴于中国的言论空间不断缩小，当局也将密切关注，以确保抗议者不会利用江泽民之死重获声势。1989年，倾向于自由主义的中国领导人胡耀邦去世，在天安门广场引发了由学生主导的民主示威。
"So far, Mr. Jiang's passing has not inspired such calls. ""The young these days have mixed feelings about Jiang, especially those who are aware enough to act on their ideas,"" said one protester, who asked to be identified only by the surname Ye. People latched on to Mr. Jiang, the protester said, mainly as a foil to criticize Mr. Xi.","到目前为止，江泽民的去世还没有激起这样的呼声。一位要求只透露自己姓叶的抗议者表示:""现在的年轻人对江泽民看法各异，特别是那些有能力按自己的想法行事的人。""这位抗议者说，人们对江泽民之所以有兴趣，主要是将他作为批评习近平的衬托。"
"In protester group chats and on Chinese social media on Wednesday, some recalled Mr. Jiang as the embodiment of an open, outward-facing China. Others pointed to his ruthlessness against those who challenged the Communist Party's authority, such as his crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement.",周三，在抗议者的群聊和中国社交媒体上，一些人回忆江泽民是开放、外向型的中国的化身。也有人指出，他对挑战共产党权威的人毫不留情，比如他对法轮功精神运动的镇压。
"For China's officials and state media, the death of the former leader presented an opportunity to repair the image of the Communist Party, as well as that of Mr. Jiang's chosen successor, Mr. Xi. Obituaries showered the former leader with effusive praise, and major Chinese websites switched into black and white, a common commemorative practice following the death of important figures.",对于中国的官员和官方媒体来说，这位前领导人的去世为修复中共以及习近平的形象提供了机会，习近平是江泽民选定的继任者。官方的讣告对这位前领导人给予了高度赞扬，中国的主要网站也变成了黑白色，这是重要人物去世后常见的纪念做法。
"The party will want to ""turn Jiang's passing away and massive mourning of him and his contribution to the country as a way to consolidate people's faith"" in the party, wrote Zhu Jiangnan, an associate professor of Chinese politics at Hong Kong University, in a response to questions.","香港大学中国政治学副教授朱江南在接受采访时写道，中共想""把江泽民的去世和对他的大规模哀悼以及他对国家的贡献作为加强民众对党的信仰的一种方式""。"
"Striding out to speak to the Chinese nation just under six weeks ago, Xi Jinping exuded regal dominance. He had just won what was likely to be another decade in power. His new team of subordinates stood out as unbending loyalists. A Communist Party congress had cemented his authoritarian agenda and promised a ""new era"" when China's 1.4 billion people would stay in ever-loyal step with him and the party.","不到六周前，习近平曾大步走出来，带着帝王气派，向全国人民发表讲话。他刚刚获得了可能是又一个十年的统治权。他将清一色的亲信安排进新领导班子。二十大的召开巩固了他的威权主义议程，并承诺将中国带入14亿人民会始终忠于他和中共的""新时代""。"
"But a nationwide surge of protest has sent a stunning sign that even after one decade under Mr. Xi's rule, a small and mostly youthful part of the population dares to imagine, even demand, another China: more liberal, less controlling, politically freer. A murmur of dissent that has survived censorship, detentions and official damnation under Mr. Xi suddenly broke into a collective roar.",但全国各地最近的抗议浪潮已释放出一个惊人信号:尽管已被习近平统治了十年，但仍有一小部分以年轻人为主的人口敢于想象，甚至敢于要求一个更开明、更少控制、政治上更自由的中国。从习近平的审查制度、拘留和惩罚中幸存下来的喃喃异见声突然爆发为一种集体的咆哮。
"""I can regain my faith in society and in a generation of youth,"" Chen Min, an outspoken Chinese journalist and writer who goes by the pen name Xiao Shu, wrote in an essay this week. ""Now I've found grounds for my faith: Brainwashing can succeed, but ultimately its success has its limits.""","""我可以重拾对社会、对一代年轻人的信心了，""直言不讳的中国记者、作家陈敏(笔名笑蜀)本周在一篇文章中写道。""现在我找到了我的信心的依据，洗脑成功但其成功终究有限。"""
"Since the weekend, the police have galvanized to stamp out new protests. The authorities have been searching people's phones, warning would-be protesters, interrogating detained participants and staging loud shows of force at potential protest sites. Vigilance will only grow after the death on Wednesday of Jiang Zemin, a former Chinese president who, more in retirement than in office, gained a political patina as a relatively mild leader. His memorial service will be held on Tuesday.",警方已从上周末起开始行动，镇压新的抗议活动。有关当局搜查民众的手机，警告潜在的抗议者，审问已被拘留的参与者，并在可能发生抗议的地点严阵以待。中国前国家主席江泽民于周三去世后，官方只会进一步加强警惕。江泽民在退休后而非在任上获得了相对温和领导人的政治光环。他的追悼会将于下周二举行。
"Even so, the flash flood of defiance suggests that Mr. Xi's next years in power could be more contested and turbulent than had seemed plausible even a month ago. His hold on the party elite seems unassailable; his hold over parts of society, especially the young, seems less sure.",尽管如此，突然爆发的反抗表明，习近平在未来几年的掌权时间里可能会面对更多异见和动荡，仅一个月前这似乎还是难以想象的。他对党内精英的控制似乎不容置疑。他对社会某些部分，尤其是对年轻人的控制，却似乎不是那么确定。
"Members of a previously submerged minority opposed to Mr. Xi's hard-line policies now know that they have allies, and that could make fresh opposition over other issues more likely. The government has tried to extinguish the current discontent by signaling on Thursday that the harshest and most arbitrary Covid prevention measures will be reined in. But supporters of the nascent protest movement showed that they wanted far more to rein in the party's authoritarian reach.",以前潜入水下的反对习近平强硬政策的少数派现在知道了他们有盟友，更有可能在其他问题上发表新的反对意见。政府已试图平息当前的不满情绪，它在周四发出信号，表示将对最严厉、最任意的防疫措施进行限制。但最近抗议运动的支持者们表示，他们想要的远不止这些，他们希望缩小中共威权主义的管辖。
"""This outrage didn't come from just one policy, but maybe outrage pent up over three of four years,"" said Edward Luo, a 23-year-old who said he witnessed the protests in Shanghai. ""There's been no channel for expression.""","""这个愤怒不是来自对一个政策的愤怒，而是可能积怨了三四年，""现年23岁的爱德华·罗(音)说，他目睹了上海的抗议活动。""没有任何一个表达的渠道，像一个高压锅一样。"""
"The protests of hundreds or thousands over the weekend against Mr. Xi's stringent ""zero-Covid"" policies sometimes flared into audacious demands for democratic goals that Mr. Xi went to war against soon after taking office in 2012.","上周末，曾出现了规模达数百人到数千人不等的抗议活动，反对习近平严厉的""新冠清零""政策，有时甚至演变成了对民主目标的大胆诉求，习近平2012年上台后不久就一直把民主诉求作为打击的对象。"
"On some university campuses, students chanted for an end to censorship. When a man at a gathering in Beijing warned that it had been infiltrated by ""anti-China forces"" a trope in party discussions of pro-democracy demands other people yelled in indignation.","在一些大学校园里，学生们喊出了结束审查的口号。一名男子在北京的一个集会上警告说，抗议活动已被""境外反华势力""利用——这是中共对民主诉求惯用的说法，其他人气愤地反驳了他。"
"""We citizens all have fundamental rights, we have the right to protest and to speak out, but do we really have them?"" a raw-voiced young woman told a crowd of hundreds in Chengdu, a city in southwest China.","""咱们的公民都拥有基本权利，咱们有游行示威言论的自由权，但是真的有吗?""一名声音沙哑的年轻女子对聚集在成都的数百人说道。"
"Mr. Xi has expanded China's security apparatus into a formidable machine to quash defiance, making a repeat of the pro-democracy protest movement of 1989 much less likely. But longer term, the protests may produce a powerful and, to Mr. Xi and the party, potentially troublesome afterglow.",习近平已把中国的安全机构增强为镇压反抗的强大机器，大大降低了重演1989年民主抗议运动的可能性。但从长远来看，最近的抗议活动可能会产生一种强大的，而且对习近平和中共来说可能是麻烦的余晖。
"The crowds calling for political change marked the resurgence of a buried stream of dissenting ideas that had seemed spent after 10 years of Mr. Xi. This upswelling has survived in crevices online; in small, private bookstores; and in informal social circles that bring together like-minded people from different generations.",要求政治变革的人群标志着被压制下去的异见思想的复苏。在习近平统治了10年后，异见思想似乎已不复存在，但它们在网络审查的缝隙中、在小型私人书店里、在让不同世代的志同道合者聚在一起的非正式社交圈里幸存了下来。
"""It's like some national subconsciousness that resurfaces,"" said Geremie R. Barme, a scholar in New Zealand who studies dissent in China. ""Now it's resurfaced again, this projection of self and of rights and ideas.""","""这就像某种民族的潜意识重新浮出了水面，""新西兰研究中国异见的学者白杰明(Geremie R. Barmé)说。""现在，这种对自身、对权利和思想的设想重新浮出了水面。"""
"The protesters are a small minority of the population, and those who voiced the boldest political demands are an even smaller fringe. A number of them may come to regret their outspokenness, under official pressure, or because of career concerns in a society where the party controls opportunities, or simply because they change their minds. But, for some protesters, the experiences and connections formed may last.",抗议者在中国人口中只占一个很小部分，那些提出最大胆政治诉求的人更是少数。他们中有些人可能会迫于官方的压力，或因为担心他们在这个中共控制各种机会的社会里的职业前景，或仅仅因为他们改变了主意而后悔之前的直言不讳。但是，对有些抗议者来说，这种经历和通过其建立起来的联系也许会持续下去。
"""This generation of university students will almost certainly be more restive than the last few cohorts that have passed through since 1989,"" said Mary Gallagher, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies authoritarian politics in China. ""And they have more reason to be: Economically, the future looks bleak.""","""这代大学生几乎肯定会比1989年后读大学的几代人更焦躁不安，""密歇根大学研究中国威权主义政治的教授高敏(Mary Gallagher)说。""而且他们有更多的理由会这样:从经济上看，未来很暗淡。"""
"For much of the past three years, China's war to keep Covid cases to near zero embodied a bargain that Mr. Xi presented to the public: accept his strict policies and in return enjoy a degree of safety and stability out of reach in the United States and other countries suffering waves of mass infection. And, for much of that time, it was a deal that many Chinese people accepted, if not enthusiastically endorsed.",在过去三年的大部分时间里，中国将新冠病毒感染保持在接近零水平的防疫战体现了习近平向人民提出的一笔交易:接受他的严厉政策，就能得到享受一定程度的安全和稳定的回报，这种安全和稳定在美国和其他遭受了一波又一波大规模感染的国家可望而不可及。而且，在大部分时间里，许多中国人都接受了，甚至是热情地支持这笔交易。
But public support eroded markedly this year. The Omicron variant's relentless march made urban lockdowns more frequent and grueling. Some Chinese people have watched with envy as other countries returned to something like normal. And the zero-Covid policies were exacerbating a painful economic slowdown.,但公众的支持今年已明显减弱。奥密克戎变异株的持续不减弱传播，让封城变的更频繁、也更艰难。一些中国人羡慕地看着其他国家恢复了类似正常的生活。新冠清零政策也在加剧经济放缓的痛苦。
"In turn, some critics of Mr. Xi's pandemic policies have come to see them as embodying broader dangers in his sweeping, authoritarian ways.",相应地，一些批评习近平防疫政策的人开始把这些政策视为更广泛危险的象征，是习近平全面专制做法的体现。
"Middle-class Chinese people who before could live relatively oblivious to the party's political demands, have become frustrated over the intrusions from Covid officials and rules restricting travel and herding residents into mass quarantine sites. That became more so after the congress in October, when Mr. Xi won a third five-year term and unveiled his own leadership lineup, leaving less room to blame other officials for mistakes. The lack of a plausible successor in the new lineup implies that Mr. Xi could stay in power for at least 10 more years.",以前对中共的政治要求相对不在意的中国中产阶级已对新冠防疫官员的侵扰、旅行限制，以及强迫居民去大规模集中隔离设施的规定感到不满。这种情况在10月份召开了二十大后变得更糟，习近平在二十大上获得了第三个五年任期，公布了自己的领导班子阵容，也让把错误归咎于其他官员的余地变的更小。新阵容中没有合适的继任者，意味着习近平可能至少再执政10年。
"During the congress, a lone man protested on the Sitong Bridge in northwest Beijing, unfurling a banner denouncing Mr. Xi as a ""despotic traitor."" Despite censorship, word of the audacious act rippled across China, especially among students and professionals with some access to overseas news.","二十大召开前夕，北京四通桥上出现了一名独自行动的抗议者，他打出横幅谴责习近平是""独裁国贼""。尽管有政府的审查，有关他大胆行为的报道仍在中国传开了，尤其是在知道怎么访问海外新闻网站的学生和专业人士中。"
"""Before Sitong Bridge, I never wanted to say too much about politics,"" said a 21-year old student in Beijing who said that police officers stopped her from joining a proposed protest gathering on Monday. She asked to be identified with only her surname, Wang, fearing more trouble from the police.","""四通桥之前，我从来不想太多地谈论政治，""北京的一名21岁的学生说。她表示，警察周一阻止她去参加一个拟定的抗议集会。她担心警察会上门找更多麻烦，要求只具王姓。"
"The buildup of dissatisfaction among some groups in China also appeared to reflect ideas, information and images flowing from the rest of the world, including through Chinese students and professionals abroad, said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Irvine.",加州大学尔湾分校的中国历史教授华志坚(Jeffrey Wasserstrom)说，中国一些群体的不满情绪增加，似乎也反映了来自世界其他地方的想法、信息和图片，它们通过海外的中国学生和专业人士等各种渠道流入中国。
"For Chinese people, travel inside the country and beyond remains difficult and expensive, but they have seen their leader, Mr. Xi, attending summits abroad without a mask.",对中国人民来说，在国内旅行和去国外旅行仍很困难，而且很贵，但他们已看到自己的领导人习近平在国外出席峰会时不戴口罩。
"While Chinese citizens have remained under stringent testing rules and are wearing masks in most public places, many also have been watching mask-free crowds at the World Cup. After Chinese broadcasts began curtailing the images, a group emerged on Weibo, China's popular social media service, discussing the jolting difference.",尽管中国人民仍在接受严格的核酸检测规定，而且在大多数公共场所都戴着口罩，但许多人也看到世界杯赛场上不戴口罩的人群。中国开始删减世界杯比赛中的观众席镜头后，流行的社交媒体服务微博上出现了一个讨论这种惊人差异的群聊。
"""There's a porousness to the efforts to have even the most totalitarian control over the flow of information,"" Professor Wasserstrom said. ""There are still people moving across borders and communicating.""","""即使是最极权主义的信息流动控制也有漏洞，""华志坚说。""仍有人在跨越边境进行信息交流。"""
"After so many years without large-scale urban protests in China, and then the isolation of the Covid years, the experience or even watching it online from a distance was almost unworldly for some. Now that experience may embolden them to rebel again.",在中国这么多年没发生大规模城市抗议活动之后，在度过了几年孤立的新冠防控生活之后，抗议体验——甚至只是从远处在网上观看——对一些人来说几乎是不真实的。现在，这种体验可能会让他们再次反抗的胆子更大。
"""This was the first time we heard such intense and frank resistance in our own mother tongue, and that was very special,"" said May Hu, who said she watched a livestream of the Shanghai protests on Instagram from her home in Hunan Province, southern China. She preferred to use her English personal name to try to avoid official reprisals. ""I think it left a lot of people feeling that there is hope.""","我们是第一次听到自己母语的这样强烈又直白的反抗，这很有意义，""梅·胡(音)说，她说她在湖南家中看了 Instagram上的上海抗议视频。她希望用自己的英文名，以免遭到官方报复。""我觉得让很多人都感到了有希望。"""
"But while an alternative China, inspired by ideas of dissent and democracy, has partly found its voice, Mr. Xi is sure to reassert his idea of China, one of firm order and visceral distrust of liberal ideas.",但是，虽然一个受异见和民主思想启发的不同的中国已经部分找到了自己的声音，但习近平肯定会坚持自己对中国的想法，也就是有坚定秩序、打心眼里不相信开明思想的中国。
"Mr. Xi's advisers are likely to be figuring out how to redouble censorship and ideological indoctrination in universities. In April 2013, months after coming to power, Mr. Xi approved an edict calling for an offensive against electoral democracy, freedom of the press and constitutional limits on state power precisely the ideas that groups of students and residents have called for in recent days.",习近平的顾问们可能正在研究加强大学里的审查和意识形态灌输的方法。习近平上台后不久，曾在2013年4月批准颁布了一份内部文件，要求打击民主选举、新闻自由和用宪法限制国家权力等想法——这正是成群的学生和居民最近几天所呼吁的。
"Now Mr. Xi's second decade at the top may commence with another ideological offensive to reassert the party's hold over minds, especially among students and young workers.",现在，习近平在掌权的第二个十年开始之际，可能会再次展开意识形态攻势，以重申中共对思想的控制，尤其是在学生和年轻工人中。
"""It will be a grinding, planned-out, constant response,"" said Mr. Barme, the academician in New Zealand. ""This is a system with nearly 100 million party members stretching into every aspect of society.""","""这将是一场艰巨的、精心策划的、无休止的反应战，""新西兰学者白杰明说。""这是个有着近亿党员的制度，管着社会的所有方面。"""
"Outside observers could be forgiven for seeing hints of the Arab Spring, even revolution, in the protests sweeping China's cities.","在席卷中国各城市的抗议之中，外界观察者嗅到了""阿拉伯之春""乃至革命的迹象，这么想情有可原。"
"The demonstrations are the country's largest and most ambitious in years, with some participants even calling for the country's top leader, Xi Jinping, to step down. On Wednesday, new videos emerged of clashes the night before in the southern city of Guangzhou in which residents toppled barricades and threw bottles at officers.",这是中国多年来规模最大、声势最强的示威活动，一些参与者甚至要求国家最高领导人习近平下台。周三，南方城市广州前一晚发生冲突的新视频流出，视频中居民推倒了路障，还向警察投掷瓶子。
"But if protesters in China hope to bring sweeping political change, they may find that they face hurdles beyond even their government's fearsome reputation for quashing dissent and still tougher odds than might be apparent on the surface.",但希望带来彻底政治变革的中国抗议者可能会发觉，他们所面临的阻碍远不止是政府镇压异议的威名，而他们的胜算也远没有看上去那么大。
"Three major forces, two of them global in nature and one particular to China, stand in their way.",阻挡他们的有三股力量，其中两股属于全球共性，另一股则是中国特性。
"For one, protests aimed at ousting a leader or government have seen their odds of success plummet in recent years, with the overwhelming majority now failing amid changes in the nature of communication, organizing and repression a trend that China seems to fit.",首先，近年来要求领导人或政府下台的抗议成功几率直线下降，由于沟通、组织和镇压的性质都在变，此类抗议绝大多数都失败了，中国似乎也符合这一趋势。
"For another, China's government embodies a type of authoritarianism, known as a revolutionary government, that new scholarship has found to be exceedingly durable against even explosive unrest.",其次，中国政府所代表的威权主义也被称为革命政权，新的学术研究发现，即便面临严重动乱，此类政权仍能持久稳固。
"Lastly, China's ruling Communist Party has repeatedly proven its exceptional skill at managing eruptions of popular anger, which are more common there, albeit on a smaller scale, than outside observers might assume.",最后，中国执政的共产党一再展现出控制民愤爆发的非凡能力，这些爆发虽然规模较小，但比外界观察人士想象得更普遍。
"The government is also especially skilled at maintaining unity among the country's elite, which is often the deciding factor in whether protesters can force systemic change.",中国政府还特别擅长团结国内精英阶层，而这一阶层往往是抗议能否推动系统性变革的决定因素。
"That does not mean the protests are doomed. Popular movements demanding an autocrat's removal do still sometimes succeed. And there are many versions of success that do not include Mr. Xi's departure for example, a relaxation of the country's ""zero Covid"" policies.",但这并不意味着抗议注定失败。要求罢免独裁者的人民运动仍有成功的可能。而各种层面上的成功并不一定包括习近平下台——例如放松国内新冠清零政策也可以算在内。
"Still, without some of China's elite breaking with Mr. Xi to support the protesters, William Hurst, a Northwestern University scholar, wrote on Twitter, ""the most likely scenario I can see is that the protests fizzle out (as most such movements do in most countries).""","尽管如此，西北大学学者威廉·赫斯特在Twitter上写道，如果中国精英阶层中无人对抗习近平，支持抗议者，""最可能看到的情况就是抗议逐渐平息下去(正如大多数国家发生的此类运动)。"""
"""Having erupted spontaneously in a short period,"" predicted Mr. Hurst, who studies Chinese social movements, ""they will fade away without reaching any climax or denouement.""","""这些抗议在短时间内自发点燃，""研究中国社会运动的赫斯特预测道，""也会在没有高潮或结局的情况下逐渐熄灭。"""
Protests' Waning Power,抗议势头减弱
"Throughout most of the 20th century, mass protests seeking a change in government grew steadily more common and more likely to succeed worldwide, felling many a dictator. By the early 2000s, two in three such movements ultimately succeeded, according to research led by Erica Chenoweth of Harvard University.",纵观20世纪，寻求政府变革的大规模抗议在全球范围内都愈发普遍，成功几率也更高，许多独裁者因此下台。根据由哈佛大学埃丽卡·切诺维斯主导的研究，到2000年代之初，此类抗议运动有三分之二取得了成功。
"In retrospect, it was a high-water mark.",现在看来，那已经是顶点了。
"In the mid-2000s, though such protests continued to rise in frequency, their success rate began to drop. By the end of the 2010s, their odds of forcing a change in government had halved, to one in three. Data from the early 2020s suggests that it may have already halved again, to one in six.",到2000年代中期，虽然发生此类抗议的频率继续上升，但成功率开始下降。到2010年代末，它们迫使政府更迭的可能性已减半，降至三分之一。2020年代初的数据表明，此数字可能再次减半，降至六分之一。
"""Nonviolent campaigns are seeing their lowest success rates in more than a century,"" Dr. Chenoweth wrote in a recent paper, though this applied only to movements seeking a leader's removal or territorial independence.","""非暴力运动的成功率已是一个多世纪以来的最低值，""切诺维斯在最近一篇论文中写道，但这一数据仅适用于寻求罢免领导人或领土独立的运动。"
"Curiously, this change arrived just as mass protests became more common, faster to rise and larger in size worldwide a trend that China's lightning-strike protests, stretching over multiple cities, would seem to fit.",奇怪的是，就在这种变化出现之际，全球大规模抗议活动却愈发普遍，爆发速度越来越快、规模越来越大——席卷中国多座城市的迅猛抗议浪潮似乎也符合这种趋势。
What changed?,是什么变了?
"Social media, which enables protesters to gather in once-unthinkable numbers with little formal leadership, may paradoxically also undermine those movements, according to a theory by Zeynep Tufekci, a Columbia University sociologist and New York Times Opinion columnist.",根据哥伦比亚大学社会学家和《纽约时报》观点专栏作家泽奈普·图费克奇的理论，社交媒体能在几乎没有正规领导的情况下聚合起数量难以想象的抗议者，但吊诡的是，它也可能破坏这些运动。
"In earlier eras, activists might spend years building the organizational ties necessary to mobilize nationally. Social media allows would-be protesters to skip those steps and spur one another to action with as little as a viral post.",此前的活动人士可能要花费数年时间才能建立全国性动员所必需的组织联系。社交媒体能让潜在的抗议者跳过这些步骤，可能只需一条病毒式传播的帖子就能激发彼此的行动。
The result is rallies that put thousands or millions in the street overnight but often fizzle just as quickly.,结果就是，一夜之间成千上万的人走上街头——但往往会以同样的速度草草收场。
"Leaderless and decentralized, social media protests more easily fracture, especially under repression. And they struggle to coordinate strategically, a necessary step for pressing concrete demands or cultivating allies in positions of power.",缺乏领导、各自为战的社交媒体抗议更容易分裂，特别是在镇压之下。抗议者也难以进行战略协调，这是提出具体诉求或培养当权盟友的必要步骤。
"At the same time, autocratic governments, learning from uprisings in the 2000s in former Soviet states, have grown savvier at outmaneuvering dissent.",与此同时，专制政府从2000年代前苏联国家的起义中吸取了教训，对付异议的手段也更加精明。
"Rather than resort to the overwhelming crackdowns of prior eras, which often backfired, they now undermine protests through slower, subtler methods. They spread confusion through propaganda, promote fissures within movements, contain protests and then wait them out, or apply just enough force to discourage protesters without provoking wider anger.",比起以前那种经常适得其反的大规模镇压，这些政府如今更愿意缓而图之。通过政治宣传散播混乱，助长运动内部的分裂，从而遏制抗议势头，然后等其偃旗息鼓，或是在不引发更广泛愤怒的情况下，使用恰到好处的武力来挫败抗议者。
And autocracies increasingly cooperate and share methods across borders in what they see as a common struggle.,而且，各国专制政权之间的合作与经验分享也越来越多，因为在他们看来，这是一场共同的斗争。
"China has been a global leader in this, selling the technology of digital repression and surveillance worldwide. Its leaders, after all, are deeply experienced at managing protests.",中国一直都是这方面的全球领导者，在全世界到处兜售数字镇压和监控技术。毕竟，中国领导人应对抗议的经验非常丰富。
Managed Dissent,管控下的异议
"Though outsiders might assume that China's notoriously authoritarian controls have made protest unthinkable there, especially since the pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989, the opposite is true.",特别是在1989年的民主示威之后，外人可能以为中国臭名昭著的威权控制会让抗议成为不可能之事，但事实恰恰相反。
"The country sees tens of thousands of protests every year, according to data tracked through the mid-2010s by the Chinese academic Sun Liping. Most are local, aimed at issues like pollution from a state-run plant or official corruption.",根据中国学者孙立平在2010年代中期统计的数据，中国每年抗议事件多达数以万计。大多抗议都是地方性的，针对的是国营工厂造成的污染或官员贪腐等问题。
"China's leaders are thought to tolerate a hum of protest, perhaps even welcome it within limits, so as to ""siphon off popular discontent without destabilizing the system as a whole,"" the China scholars Vivienne Shue and Patricia M. Thornton have written.","外界认为，中国领导人能够容忍小范围抗议，甚至可能在一定限度上接受这样的抗议，为的是""在不破坏体制稳定的情况下吸收民众的不满，""中国问题学者许慧文(Vivienne Shue)和蓝梦林(Patricia M. Thornton)这样写道。"
"China's leaders know that they cannot be totally indifferent to public will. But, without genuine elections, citizens have few ways to convey their points of anger. Tolerating some protest gives leaders a way to head off dissent, and to allow citizens to feel heard, before anger boils over.",中国领导人知道他们不能全然不顾公众的意志。然而，在缺少真正的选举的情况下，国民没有多少传达愤怒态度的途径。容忍一些抗议，让领导人可以遏制异议，同时让国民觉得自己的意见得到倾听，避免愤怒爆发。
"The official response is often ""much less rigid and more managerial than is often presumed,"" the China scholar H. Christoph Steinhardt has written, adding that the state ""still tolerates a considerable amount of contention.""","官方的应对往往""远没有通常假想的那样严厉，偏重于管控，""中国学者H·克里斯托夫·斯特恩哈特写道，他还说政府""仍会容忍相当一部分的争论""。"
"A few protests have grown into something larger. In 2002, tens of thousands of workers in the city of Liaoyang rallied to demand the removal of corrupt officials who'd closed their factories. In 2011, locals in the village of Wukan expelled party officials outright, declaring a kind of autonomy and inspiring other villages to follow.",有时候抗议会演变为大规模事件。2002年，辽阳市数万工人游行示威，要求罢免关闭了他们的工厂的腐败官员。2011年，乌坎村民直接驱逐了党干部，宣布进行某种自治，其它村也纷纷效仿。
"Both were initially described as major, perhaps existential, threats to Communist Party rule. The party appeared taken by surprise.",这些事件起初都被说成是关乎共产党存亡的重大威胁。党似乎显得措手不及。
"But, in both cases, China's leaders contained the protests, allowing them to tire out. They eventually bowed to many of the protesters' demands, even jailing the corrupt officials in Liaoyang, leading protests to gradually disperse. Then officials jailed the protest leaders, too.",但中国领导人对这两起抗议都采取了抑制的手段，让抗议慢慢平息下去。他们最终满足了抗议者的部分诉求，甚至把辽阳的贪官关进监狱，促使抗议人群逐渐散去。然后政府把抗议领导者也关了起来。
Revolutionary Resilience,革命者适应力
Why do some dictators fall to public protest and others don't?,为什么有的独裁者在民众抗议中倒台，有的则没有?
"In a new book-length examination of every authoritarian government in the past century, the scholars Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way arrived at one major factor: how that government came to power in the first place.",学者斯蒂芬·莱维茨基和卢坎·韦用他们的新书检视了过去一百年的所有专制政府，最终得出一个主要因素:该政府最初是如何得到权力的。
"Since 1900, they found, about 20 autocracies have risen out of sweeping social revolutions. These include the Soviet Union, Iran's Islamic Republic and Communist-led China.",他们发现，从1900年至今，约20个专制政权通过全方位的社会革命上台。这其中包括苏联、伊朗的伊斯兰共和国和共产党领导的中国。
"On average, autocracies survive about 10 years. After that, their odds of collapsing increase every year as public support erodes and as cracks widen within the ruling elite.",专制政权平均能存在10年左右。此后随着民众支持的流失，以及统治阶层内部分歧增大，他们的崩溃几率逐年递增。
"But autocracies founded in revolution tend to survive for many decades. Their average life span is impossible to state, for the simple reason that half of those to ever form are still going. The Soviet Union made it to age 69, surpassing many democracies. Iran is also, for the moment, proving surprisingly resilient against a nationwide, monthslong protest movement.",但是通过革命上台的专制政权往往能存在数十年。它们的平均寿命是很难确定的，原因很简单，其中一半的政权至今仍然在位。苏联活了69年，超过了许多民主政体。面对持续数月的全国性抗议运动，伊朗也暂时证明自己有着出人意料的适应力。
"It's not that such systems govern better. Rather, they are nearly five times as likely to survive episodes of the sort that would fell other governments, like mass unrest or a violent power struggle.",这并不等于说这样的体制有更好的治理。只是它们在遭遇那些导致其它政府倒台的事件时，存活下来的几率高了将近五倍，例如大规模动乱或暴力的权力斗争。
"Those governments' resilience, the scholars argue, comes from the revolution that swept them into power. Revolutionary movements typically uproot every aspect of the old order, from business leaders to officer corps to administrative bureaucracies.",两位学者认为，这些政府的适应力来自让它们获得权力的革命。革命运动通常会把旧秩序的方方面面斩草除根，从商业领袖到官员集团到行政官僚机构。
"As the revolution fills these out with its own, it is left with few internal rivals or threats closing off exactly the sorts of high-level fissures that a protest movement must open in order to force a change in leadership.",革命者在这些位置上安排自己的人，于是就很少会有内部敌对或威胁——缺少了抗议运动所需要的那种在权力高层的裂隙，而要迫使领导层做出改变，必须有这样的裂隙。
Such systems are also remarkably cohesive. And disagreements or power struggles are among revolutionaries who are bought into the system and work to uphold it as is.,这样的体制有着颇强的凝聚力。因为分歧或权斗是在通过革命上台的革命者之间进行的，他们会合力保持现状。
"And revolutionary features that lend resilience, Dr. Levitsky and Dr. Way argue, are especially pronounced in China: A deeply institutionalized party bureaucracy. Internally enforced hierarchies of power. Pervasive political control of security and military forces. Deep party roots in everything from business boardrooms to local village affairs.",莱维茨基和韦表示，这种革命特性所带来的适应力在中国体现得格外明显:这是一个高度机构化的政党官僚机构。在内部实施的权力等级制度。对安全和军事力量进行无处不在的政治控制。从企业董事会到地方村镇，一切都有着深刻的政党根源。
"Even the strongest government has its breaking point. But China's, the scholars concluded, may well be ""one of the most durable regimes in modern history.""","即使最强大的政府也有极限。但两位学者认为，中国可能会是""近现代最持久的政权之一""。"
"Workers and residents rebelling against a pandemic lockdown in an industrial district of southern China clashed with riot police in white hazmat suits twice this week, the latest flare-up of anger against ""zero Covid"" restrictions that have spawned protests across the country.",本周，在中国南方的一个工业区，反对疫情封锁的工人和居民与身穿白色防护服的防暴警察两次发生冲突，这是针对新冠清零限制措施的最新一次民愤爆发，这些措施已经在全国范围内引发抗议。
"The Communist Party under Xi Jinping has been confronting China's widest and boldest surge of protest in decades, as large numbers gathered over the weekend to denounce Mr. Xi's stringent, exhausting and increasingly difficult efforts to eliminate Covid cases.",习近平领导下的中共面临着中国数十年来最广泛、最大胆的抗议浪潮，上周末出现大批民众集会，谴责习近平让人疲惫不堪和越来越难以实现的严格清零努力。
"Although security forces reasserted control over neighborhoods and university campuses this week, the tumult on Monday and Tuesday nights on the edge of Guangzhou suggested that poor, frustrated communities of migrant workers may keep pushing back against the ""zero Covid"" measures, especially the weekslong shutdowns of neighborhoods.",虽然警方本周重新控制了街区和大学校园，但周一和周二晚间广州市郊发生的骚乱表明，贫困、不满的外来务工者群体(特别是那些被封控长达数周时间的人)可能会继续反对清零措施。
"Crowds of hundreds in the city's Houjiao neighborhood clashed with the police, following days of angry confrontations there.",在数日的愤怒对峙之后，广州市后滘村数以百计的民众与警方发生了冲突。
"Some threw glass bottles at lines of anti-riot officers. Some tore down barriers meant to lock in the crowded warrens of shops and cheap apartments. They pushed over a makeshift hut used for Covid tests, while hundreds of onlookers roared in approval. Members of the crowd also overturned a small van.",有人向防暴警察投掷玻璃瓶。有人拆除了用来封锁密集商铺和廉租房的屏障。他们推倒了一处临时核酸点，许多围观者大声欢呼。人群还掀翻了一辆小货车。
"Video showed hundreds of police officers pouring into the area, shouting and banging their clubs on their riot shields and subduing residents. Several men, apparently handcuffed, were led away by the officers, another video showed.",视频显示，大批警察涌入这里，大喊大叫，并用警棍敲打防暴盾牌，威吓居民。另一段视频显示，几名显然戴着手铐的男子被警察带走。
"""The working people mostly feel that the lockdown has gone on too long; it's been over a month,"" said a resident of the neighborhood who joined the nighttime protest. He asked to be identified only by his surname, Zhang, citing fear of punishment for describing the confrontation.","""打工上班的人觉得主要封太久了，封了一个多月，""一位在附近参加了夜间抗议的居民表示。由于害怕受到惩罚，他要求只具张姓。"
"Despite Beijing's promises that ""zero Covid"" restrictions would be more selectively enforced, Mr. Zhang said, local officials under intense pressure to keep infection rates down went to extremes in shutting down the area, while providing inadequate food to penned-in residents.",张先生说，尽管北京承诺更精准地执行清零措施，但地方官员在降低感染率的巨大压力下采取了极端做法，封锁整个片区，却没有为封控居民提供足够的食物。
"""Some people don't even have things like regular noodles and have to eat instant noodles day in, day out,"" he said. ""A lot of places haven't had supplies for ages, and finally that's why this happened. It wasn't just everyone kicking up a fuss.""","""有人甚至连一般的面条都吃不上，只能天天吃方便面，""他说。""好多地方这么久没有物资，才发生这样的事的。不是大家去闹事的。"""
"The Haizhu District of Guangzhou, where the clashes took place, is a center of garment production, and tens of thousands of migrant workers from rural China make a living in small factories, shops and diners that cram its streets.",发生冲突的广州市海珠区是一处服装生产中心，这里的街区小作坊、商铺和餐馆密布，成千上万来自中国农村的外来务工者在此谋生。
"But there and across much of China, Covid restrictions on work and travel have added to a wider economic slowdown and pushed many small businesses into closure or bankruptcy, leaving migrant workers struggling to make a living.",但在这里以及中国大部分地区，防疫对工作和出行的限制加剧了更广泛的经济放缓，迫使许多小企业倒闭或破产，导致务工人员难以谋生。
"""People don't have anywhere to vent their frustration,"" said a local resident surnamed Hu, a construction business owner whose work has been suspended. He witnessed the arrival of hundreds of riot police officers near his home on Tuesday evening and felt sympathetic to the protesting workers. ""The police were not protecting the people. They were scaring the people.""","""老百姓诉苦都不知道去哪里诉苦，""当地一位胡姓居民说。他是建筑公司老板，工程已经被暂停。周二晚上，他看到大批防暴警察来到他家附近，对抗议工人深感同情。""特警不是保护百姓，是吓唬百姓。"""
"A rise in Covid cases in Guangzhou over the past several weeks led officials to impose lockdowns across several districts that are home to a total of about six million people, according to government announcements.",根据政府公告，过去几周广州新冠病例的增加导致官员在多个城区实施封锁，涉及的常住人口约有600万。
"In the Haizhu District in the city's south, some 1.8 million residents were ordered to stay at home and undergo daily coronavirus testing, and local authorities erected barricades around neighborhoods where Covid cases were recorded. Two weeks ago, residents of one neighborhood marched to protest the lack of food and other necessities while held at home for weeks, people there told The New York Times at the time.",位于该市南部的海珠区约有180万居民被勒令居家，每天接受新冠检测，地方当局在有新冠病例报告的社区周围设置了路障。当地居民告诉《纽约时报》，两周前，有一个社区的居民游行抗议，他们被关在家数周时间，食物和其他必需品都已经短缺。
"On Wednesday, multiple districts in Guangzhou, including Haizhu, lifted Covid prevention measures in some areas that are not listed as ""high risk."" Close contacts, who had been sent to centralized quarantine facilities, are allowed to quarantine at home if they meet a certain standard, according to a government notice.","周三，包括海珠区在内的多个广州城区取消了一些非""高风险""地区的封控措施。根据政府通知，被送去集中隔离的密接者若是符合一定条件可以改成居家隔离。"
"China's leadership has remained silent about the protests of the past week, although the unrest has drawn global attention, including comments from the White House, and unsettled international investors. When called and asked about the nights of clashes, a Haizhu District official and a police officer on Wednesday both promptly hung up, each saying, ""I don't know about it.""","对于过去一周的抗议，中国领导层始终保持沉默。但骚乱引发了全球关注，包括白宫的表态，也让国际投资者感到不安。周三，当被致电问及夜间冲突的情况时，海珠区一名官员和一名警察都迅速挂断电话，两人均表示，""我不知道。"""
"The deaths of Chinese Communist leaders are always fraught moments of political theater, and especially so now with the passing of Jiang Zemin soon after a wave of public defiance on a scale unseen since Mr. Jiang came to power in 1989.",中共领导人的去世总是充满政治戏剧的时刻，尤其是现在江泽民的去世，就在此前，中国爆发了自1989年他出任中共总书记以来未曾有过的公开反抗浪潮。
"China's sternly autocratic current leader, Xi Jinping, must preside over the mourning for Mr. Jiang, who died on Wednesday at 96, while he also grapples with widespread protests against China's exceptionally stringent Covid-19 restrictions. The demonstrations have at times also boldly called for China to return to the path of political liberalization that seemed at least thinkable, even openly discussable, under Mr. Jiang during the 1990s.",江泽民于周三去世，享年96岁。中国严厉专制的现任领导人习近平必须出面主持江泽民的悼念活动，同时，他还要努力设法解决针对中国异常严苛的新冠清零措施的广泛抗议活动。有些抗议者已大胆地呼吁中国回到政治自由化的道路上去，在江泽民领导下的20世纪90年代，政治自由化似乎至少可以想象的，甚至可以公开讨论。
"How Mr. Xi orchestrates that feat paying tribute to Mr. Jiang while preventing him from becoming a symbolic cudgel against Mr. Xi's politics will be another challenge for him in the coming weeks, as China tries to manage rising coronavirus cases and an economic slowdown.",随着中国努力应对不断上升的新冠病毒感染病例和经济增长放缓，习近平如何安排悼念活动将是他在未来几周面临的又一个挑战，悼念活动既要表达对江泽民的敬意，同时也要防止让他变成反习的象征性棍棒。
"""We mourn Comrade Jiang Zemin with a heavy heart, and will turn our grief into strength,"" Mr. Xi said on Wednesday, according to an official summary of his comments to a visiting Laotian leader. The digital home page of People's Daily, the party's main newspaper, turned to a mournful black and white.","据中国官媒对习近平与来访的老挝领导人会晤的简短报道，习近平在周三表示，""我们沉痛悼念江泽民同志，将化悲痛为力量。""中共主要报纸《人民日报》网站的主页变成了表示哀悼的黑白两色。"
"""How they mourn his death may potentially provoke more anger, even though Jiang Zemin never enjoyed the popularity Hu Yaobang did,"" said Lynette H. Ong, a political scientist at the University of Toronto who studies China, referring to the leader whose sudden death in 1989 ignited the Tiananmen Square protest movement. ""At the very least, it will give the people a legitimate reason to congregate and mourn.""","""虽然江泽民从未享有过胡耀邦曾享有的那种爱戴，但中共哀悼江泽民去世的方式有激起更多愤怒的可能，""多伦多大学研究中国的政治学者王惠玲(Lynette H. Ong)说，她提到的胡耀邦在1989年突然去世，引发了天安门广场的抗议运动。""至少会给人们一个聚集和哀悼的正当理由。"""
"Almost instantly, the announcement of Mr. Jiang's passing brought a torrent of online tributes from Chinese people. Quite a few made thinly veiled, often sardonic comparisons between Mr. Jiang and Mr. Xi, whose authoritarian policies have taken censorship and ideological controls to new heights.",江泽民逝世的消息几乎立刻让中国人潮流般地涌到网上表示哀悼。不少人对江习两人进行了几乎不加掩饰、常常带有讽刺意味的比较，习近平的威权主义政策已将中国的审查制度和对意识形态的控制提升到了新的高度。
"One comment on Weibo, a social media service in China, recalled when Mr. Jiang in 1998 used a megaphone to urge rescuers to stop flood barriers from breaking. The comment said Chinese society at the time was ""vigorously advancing, high spirited, singing as we advanced into a new era.""","中国社交媒体服务平台微博上的一条评论回忆了江泽民1998年拿着喇叭在大堤上动员人们抗洪的情景。评论写道，当时的中国社会""蓬勃向上，意义(气)风发，唱着走进新时代""。"
"Many other remarks were not quite as effusive. As a leader, Mr. Jiang could be turgid and repressive when his political survival called for it, including against followers of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement. He also was well known for his high opinion of himself and his equally high-hitched pants.",另外的许多评论并不这么热情洋溢。江泽民担任最高领导人期间，出于政治生存需要也会采取过度和镇压做法，包括对被取缔的法轮功精神运动的追随者们。他也以自视过高和穿同样过高的裤腰而闻名。
"But Chinese people found plenty of reasons to think more fondly of Mr. Jiang's time in high central office from 1989 to 2004, when China shifted from a post-Tiananmen political freeze to years of giddy, sometimes reckless and polluting growth. The party tightly controlled political life, but it allowed rights lawyers, commercial news outlets, combative dissidents and liberal-minded party scholars to participate in public debate a modicum of freedom that does not exist now.","但中国人找到了很多愈加怀念江泽民的理由，在他从1989年到2004年担任中共中央总书记期间，中国从""六四""镇压后的政治冰冻期进入了令人头晕目眩、有时不顾一切，而且污染严重的多年经济增长阶段。那时候，虽然中共严格控制着政治生活，但也允许维权律师、商业新闻媒体、好斗的异见人士和有自由思想的中共学者公开辩论，这些少量的自由现已不复存在。"
"""Toad, we blamed you wrongly before; you're the ceiling, not the floor,"" said one comment, citing a popular nickname for Mr. Jiang, drawing on his squat figure and large glasses.","""蛤，我们以前错怪你了;你是天花板，不是地板，""一条评论写道，用的是江泽民在网上一个常见的绰号，取笑他的方正身材和大眼镜。"
"Another comment recalled 1997, when Chinese audiences were allowed to enjoy Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in a movie with a relatively risque story for that time in China. ""Farewell,"" said one popular comment marking Mr. Jiang's death, ""Thank you for letting us all watch Titanic that year.""","另一条评论提到1997年他允许中国观众观看莱昂纳多迪·卡普里奥和凯特·温斯莱特在一部电影中的表演，片中的故事对当时来说相当有伤风化。""永别了，""一条悼念江泽民逝世的走红评论写道，""感谢您当年让我们都能看《泰坦尼克号》。"""
"Hours after his death, censors on Weibo quickly moved to restrict comments on the news, apparently to prevent relatively harmless nostalgia from turning into barbed criticisms of Mr. Xi and the party, especially after several days of political turbulence. The ""Titanic"" comment was erased after garnering tens of thousands of likes.",在江泽民去世后的几小时里，微博平台的审查员们迅速行动起来，对有关这条消息的评论进行限制，显然是为了防止相对无害的怀旧情绪变成对习近平和中共的尖锐批评，尤其是在几天的政治动荡之后。提《泰坦尼克号》的那条评论在获得了几万个点赞后被删除。
"""In death, Hu Yaobang became a heroic martyr, while in life he didn't enjoy that reputation at all,"" said Geremie R. Barme, a Sinologist in New Zealand. ""In the nostalgic haze of today, the same could happen with Jiang Zemin.""","""胡耀邦死后变成了一名英雄烈士，他活着的时候根本没有那种名声，""新西兰汉学家白杰明(Geremie R. Barmé)说。""在今天的怀旧迷雾中，同样的事情也可能发生在江泽民身上。"""
"On the weekend, protesters in Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu and other Chinese cities gathered in the hundreds and thousands to denounce stringent, intrusive and onerous policies aimed at stamping out coronavirus cases. Some seized on the opportunity to also call for democratic change, freedom of the press, an end to pervasive censorship, and even the removal of Mr. Xi and the Communist Party.",上周末，上海、北京、成都和中国其他城市都发生了有成百上千人参加的抗议活动，人们谴责严厉、扰民、费力的新冠清零政策。还有人借机呼吁民主改革、新闻自由、结束无处不在的审查，甚至要求习近平和中共下台。
"The defiance had some distant echoes with the movement of 1989, when the death of Hu Yaobang, a reform-minded leader who had been pushed from power, ignited student protests that occupied Tiananmen Square until an armed crackdown that reached the square on June 4. The deaths of other Chinese leaders have also become occasions for protest and dissent, especially Zhou Enlai in 1976.",这些反抗与1989年的民主运动有些遥遥呼应之处。有改革思想的领导人胡耀邦被迫下台后于1989年去世，引发了学生抗议运动，他们占领了天安门广场，直到6月4日的武装镇压。其他中国领导人的去世也曾成为抗议和表达异见的场合，尤其是周恩来1976年的去世。
"Mr. Xi could use the mourning rituals for Mr. Jiang to try to ""recover from his isolated situation,"" Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing, said in written answers to questions about the death of Mr. Jiang.","北京的历史学者章立凡在书面回答有关江泽民逝世的问题时写道，习近平""可能是想借丧事强调正统地位，挽回孤立处境""。"
"""Whether this will be a release from the nightmare of June 4 or bring it back, we just have to wait and see,"" Mr. Zhang said.","""此举究竟会摆脱六四噩梦还是召来六四噩梦，还有待观察，""他写道。"
"But any repeat of 1989 appears extremely unlikely under Mr. Xi's heavy net of security, suggested Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation who analyzes the Chinese Communist Party. ""The death of Jiang Zemin will not have a ripple effect in Chinese politics,"" he said.","但詹姆斯敦基金会研究中共的高级研究员林和立认为，在习近平巨大的国家安全网下，重演1989年的可能性极小。""江泽民之死不会给中国政治带来涟漪效应，""他说。"
"Even so, Mr. Xi must orchestrate the funerary events to ensure that it stays that way. In announcing Mr. Jiang's death, the party paid tribute to his achievements, especially in advancing economic changes and modernizing China's military. It also urged the country to rally around Mr. Xi.",即便如此，习近平也必须精心安排追悼活动，以确保其不变成更大的事件。中共在宣布江泽民逝世时，对他的成就表示了敬意，尤其是在推动经济改革和中国军队现代化方面。讣告还呼吁全国人民团结在习近平周围。
An announcement on mourning arrangements for Mr. Jiang indicated that a memorial service would be held and that following party custom international leaders would not be invited.,一份关于江泽民治丧安排的公告表示将举行追悼会，但按照中共的惯例，不会邀请外国领导人参加。
"If the deaths of previous major Chinese leaders like Deng Xiaoping are a guide, Mr. Xi may also preside over the service in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, bringing together thousands of officials, dignitaries and probably Mr. Jiang's family members. But fears of the spread of the coronavirus may limit the guest list this time.",如果以中国以前的主要领导人，比如邓小平的治丧活动为参照的话，习近平可能会在人民大会堂主持有数千名官员、政要，可能还有江泽民家人出席的追悼会。但由于害怕新冠病毒传播，参加这次追悼会的人数可能有限。
"No matter how small the ceremony, however, there will also be the tricky question of whether and how to include Hu Jintao, China's top leader in the decade between Mr. Jiang and Mr. Xi. Mr. Hu's name was on a long list of officials and retired officials who will oversee arrangements for the mourning activities.",但无论追悼会的规模多小，都有一个棘手的问题，那就是要不要包括胡锦涛，以及怎样将他包括进来，胡锦涛在江习之间的十年担任中国最高领导人。胡锦涛的名字已出现在由官员和退休官员组成的江泽民治丧委员会长名单上。
"But Mr. Hu, notoriously buttoned down while in power, caused a rare commotion during a party congress in October that disrupted Mr. Xi's triumphant moment before he won a new five-year term in power.",胡锦涛在执政期间以保守著称，他在今年10月召开的中共二十大上引起了罕见的骚动，搅乱了习近平即将获得第三个五年任期前的胜利时刻。
"On the last day of the congress, Mr. Hu appeared dazed, reached for a document on a table in front of him, and after some commotion was abruptly escorted out of the hall while other senior officials mostly stared ahead, stone-faced. Theories spread that Mr. Hu was somehow protesting against Mr. Xi, though Mr. Hu's confused expression suggests that illness was the more likely cause. Still, Mr. Xi will not want a repeat.",在最后一天的闭幕式上，胡锦涛显得有点茫然，他伸手去拿面前桌上的一份文件，一阵骚动之后，他突然被带出会场，其他高级官员则大多面无表情地看着前方。有个说法是，胡锦涛是在以某种方式抗议习近平，但胡锦涛脸上的困惑表情暗示，疾病是更可能的原因。尽管如此，习近平一定不想看到同样的情况再次发生。
"Faced with growing social unrest over its tough pandemic measures, China said on Tuesday it would ramp up vaccination of its oldest citizens, a move that experts have argued is crucial if the world's second largest economy is to ease Covid measures and reopen its economy.",在强硬防疫措施已经引发越来越多的社会动荡之际，中国于周二表示，将加强老年人的疫苗接种。专家们认为，如果这一世界第二大经济体要放松新冠管制并重新开放经济，这一举措至关重要。
"Authorities will bring vaccines to people in nursing homes, go door-to-door, use mobile vaccination stations and press those who are reluctant to give a reason, according to a statement from the National Health Commission. About 90 percent of China's total population is fully vaccinated, but among those 80 and older, the number is much lower 65.8 percent are fully vaccinated, and only 40 percent have received a booster.",根据国家卫健委的声明，有关部门将为养老院送疫苗，走访上门、使用流动接种车，并对不愿拿出拒绝接种理由的人施压。中国约有90%的人口完全接种了疫苗，但80岁以上群体的接种率要低得多，65.8%的人完全接种，只有40%的人打了加强针。
"""It is necessary to speed up vaccination, especially the vaccination of the elderly,"" said Xia Gang, a National Health Commission official in charge of vaccination. ""I hope that elderly friends will actively complete the vaccination as soon as possible to protect the health of themselves and their families.""","""(需要)为老年人接种新冠病毒疫苗提供更好的服务，""负责疫苗接种工作的国家卫健委官员夏刚表示。""也希望老年朋友们，特别是80岁以上的老年朋友们积极主动接种疫苗，为个人健康护航。"""
"The new initiative was made public ahead of a news conference with officials from China's top health bodies on Tuesday afternoon. News of the briefing prompted rumors that authorities were considering easing testing and isolation requirements, stoking optimism in Asian financial markets that China was ready to make a bigger move away from its ""zero Covid"" rules. Despite no signs of a broader shift, investors appeared to be relieved that Chinese officials were making any effort.","周二下午，中国最高卫生机构的官员在召开新闻发布会前宣布了这一新倡议。召开发布会的消息引发了有关当局正在考虑放松检测和隔离要求的传言，鼓舞了亚洲金融市场的乐观情绪，以为中国要拿出摆脱新冠""清零""政策的大动作。尽管没有迹象表明中国政府将做出更广泛调整，但中国官员做出任何努力的尝试都会让投资者感到宽慰 。"
"Hong Kong's market finished 5 percent higher, while in Shanghai and Shenzhen, stocks rose more than 2 percent.",香港股市收高5%，而上海和深圳股市上涨超过2%。
Similar optimism fueled a rally in Chinese stocks earlier this month when investors on Wall Street made a bet that China would loosen its measures amid growing economic pain. That positive sentiment remained as China's National Health Commission issued a flurry of small changes aimed at narrowing the scope of the country's vast and intrusive pandemic apparatus.,本月早些时候，类似的乐观情绪推动了中国股市的上涨，当时华尔街投资者押注中国将在经济阵痛加剧的情况下放松防疫。在中国国家卫健委发布一系列小的调整，旨在限制该国庞大且造成严重扰动的防疫机器后，这种积极情绪依然存在。
"But in the weeks since, it became clear that these measures would not amount to a broader shift in the ""zero Covid"" policy, and fears about the effect on the global economy have grown.","但在此后几周时间里，形势逐渐明朗，即这些措施算不上对新冠""清零""政策的大转向，关于其影响全球经济的担忧也越来越多。"
"China faces a predicament: Its top leadership recognizes that a blanket approach to controlling the virus is taking an increasingly large economic and social toll, but leaders are worried that widespread infections will overwhelm a rickety health care system.",中国面临着一个困境:最高领导层认识到密不透风地控制病毒传播正在造成越来越严重的经济和社会损失，但领导人还担心，大规模感染将使脆弱的医疗体系不堪重负。
"The pressures have become more acute in recent days, with people across China taking to the streets in a rare show of public protest against tough Covid lockdowns.",最近几天，矛盾愈发尖锐，全国各地的民众罕见地走上街头，公开抗议反对严厉的新冠封锁。
Chinese officials regularly point to the country's vulnerable population the old and very young as a primary reason for why the country cannot afford to ease up.,中国官员经常指出，老人和小孩这样的脆弱群体正是中国无法放松防疫的原因。
"China's top leader, Xi Jinping, most recently called the ""zero Covid"" approach an ""all out people's war to stop the spread of the virus,"" that has put ""the people and their lives above all else.""","中国最高领导人习近平最近才将清零政策称为""疫情防控的人民战争""，坚持""人民至上，生命至上""。"
"After China's boldest and most widespread protests in decades, the security apparatus built by Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, who prizes his reputation for ironclad authority, is scrambling to reassert control.",在中国发生数十年来最大胆、最广泛的抗议活动之后，重视铁腕威权声誉的中共领导人习近平打造的安全机器正在努力重新控制局面。
Public security personnel and vehicles have blanketed potential protest sites. Police officers are searching some residents' phones for prohibited apps. Officials are going to the homes of would-be protesters to warn them against illegal activities and are taking some away for questioning. Censors are scrubbing protest symbols and slogans from social media.,可能发生抗议的地点已经部署了大量警力和警车。警察正在检查部分民众的手机，查找被禁的应用程序。官员们登门造访可能的抗议者，警告他们不要从事非法活动，并带走一些人进行询问。审查人员正在删除社交媒体上的抗议象征和标语。
"On Monday, the demonstrations were already smaller and more scattered, and on Tuesday there was less talk among protesters of action that night.",周一，示威活动规模已经变小且更加分散，到周二，抗议者对于当晚采取行动的讨论更少了。
"The campaign to quash the protests on multiple fronts draws on the party's decades-old tool kit of repression and surveillance, which Mr. Xi has upgraded in pursuit of unshakable dominance. He has expanded the police forces, promoted loyal security leaders into key positions and declared that ""political security"" for him and for the party must be the bedrock of national security.","多线并行的镇压行动动用了中共数十年来的镇压和监控手段，而习近平为了追求不可动摇的统治地位，又对这些手段进行了升级。他扩充警察队伍，将忠于他的安全机关领导人提拔到关键位置，并宣称""政治安全""——不管是对他还是对党——必须成为国家安全的基石。"
"Yet even as Mr. Xi rolls out the police, he is projecting an unruffled appearance of business as usual.",然而，即便在出动警力之时，习近平仍表现出一如既往的镇定自若。
"He has stayed silent about the rare open challenge to his rule that erupted in the protests, including calls for him to step down. He appears to be wagering that by outwardly ignoring the demonstrations, he can sap their momentum while the security services move in and the party's army of online loyalists try to discredit protesters as tools of American-led subversion.",对于抗议活动中爆发的公开挑战其统治地位的罕见行为，包括要求下台的呼声，他始终保持沉默。他似乎是在打赌，靠表面上对示威活动的无视，同时安全部门介入，效忠党的网络大军则试图抹黑抗议者，称他们是美国领导的颠覆活动的工具，他能够削弱其势头。
"""They're saying as little as possible for as long as possible,"" said William Hurst, a professor at the University of Cambridge who studies politics and protest in China. ""If they speak, it could inflame the situation, so it's better to sit back and pretend nothing is happening.""","""他们会在尽可能长的时间里尽可能地少说话，""研究中国政治和抗议活动的剑桥大学教授威廉·赫斯特说。""如果他们发言，情况可能变得更糟，所以最好是不采取行动，假装什么都没有发生。"""
"On Tuesday, the People's Daily, the party's main newspaper, featured Mr. Xi's talks with the visiting Mongolian president and a front-page celebration of Mr. Xi's decade in power, but not a word about the protests, China's most widespread since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989.",周二，主要党报《人民日报》报道了习近平与来访的蒙古国总统举行会晤，并在头版庆祝习近平掌权十年，但对中国自1989年天安门民主运动以来规模最广泛的抗议活动只字不提。
"Still, there seems no doubt that inside the guarded seclusion of the party's Zhongnanhai leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Xi and his advisers have been monitoring the unrest and plotting a response. Since the protests of 1989, Chinese leaders have fixated on the dangers of anti-government social movements, determined to nip them in the bud and avoid the trauma of another bloody crackdown.",然而，可以肯定的是，在戒备森严的中南海，习近平及其顾问们在密切关注着不满的爆发，并制定应对措施。自1989年的抗议活动以来，中国领导人始终高度重视反政府社会运动的风险，决心将其消灭在萌芽状态，避免再次出现血腥镇压留下的创伤。
"Even so, the protests that broke out in parts of Shanghai, Beijing and other Chinese cities over the weekend appeared to catch leaders off guard.",即便如此，上周末在上海、北京和其他中国城市部分地区爆发的抗议似乎还是让这些领导人始料未及。
"The collective public anger first welled up in Urumqi, a city in western China where at least 10 people died in an apartment fire last week. Many people have said, despite official denials, that the deaths were caused by pandemic restrictions that prevented residents from leaving their apartment block. Protests over the tragedy escalated into wider denunciations of China's pandemic policies, as well as calls from some for democracy, a free press and other ideals anathema to the country's authoritarian rulers.",公愤首先在中国西部城市乌鲁木齐爆发，上周至少有10人在当地一起住宅楼大火中丧生。许多人表示，尽管官方予以否认，但死亡是因疫情限制措施导致人们无法逃生所致。对这场悲剧的抗议升级为对中国防疫政策的更广泛批评，还有一些对民主和新闻自由，以及令中国的独裁统治者深恶痛绝的其他理念的呼声。
"This week, China's security forces have regrouped, making new demonstrations much more difficult and risky.",本周，中国的安全部门重新部署，让接下来的示威变得更加困难和危险。
"""I am pretty sure that the security apparatus will get this under control fairly quickly,"" said H. Christoph Steinhardt, a scholar at the University of Vienna who studies patterns of protest in China. ""I guess they will begin with identifying ringleaders and then leaning on them, combined with preventive policing in public areas.""","""我很确定安全机器会很快控制住形势，""维也纳大学研究中国抗议模式的学者石磊(H. Christoph Steinhardt)说。""我想他们会先找出罪魁祸首，逼他们就范，同时在公共场所部署警力进行防范。"""
"In Hangzhou, a prosperous city about 100 miles southwest of Shanghai, the police broke up an attempted demonstration on Monday night, shouting at passers-by and dragging away one woman who was screaming. Dozens of people also confronted officers who had detained someone, chanting ""release them.""","周一晚间，在上海西南约160公里的繁华城市杭州，警方驱散了一场未遂示威，对路人大喊大叫，并拖走了一名尖叫的女子。许多人还与实施拘捕的警察对峙，高喊""放人""。"
"In the southern city of Guangzhou, a hundred or so police officers wearing helmets and white protective clothing to possibly ward off Covid banged their clubs on their riot shields as they strode through a street, warning people not to hang around.",在南方城市广州，约一百名戴着头盔、身穿白色防护服(可能是为了抵御病毒)的警察大步穿过街道，用警棍敲打防暴盾牌，警告民众不准逗留。
"Officers across China have been visiting protesters' homes or stopping possible ones on the street. They check their phones for apps banned in China, delete pictures of demonstrations and warn people not to take to the streets again.",各地警察上门寻找抗议者，或是在街头拦下可能的抗议者行动。警察会检查他们的手机里是否装有在中国被禁的应用程序，删除示威照片，并警告民众不要再上街。
"""When the police came to my door, I had to delete my text records,"" said a Beijing resident who joined a protest vigil near the Liangma River on Sunday night. She asked that only her surname, Chen, be used, citing fear of police reprisals.","""警察找上门了，我只能把我的文字记录都删除了，""一名周日晚在亮马河附近参加抗议守夜活动的北京居民说。因为害怕警方报复，她要求只具陈姓。"
"Ms. Chen said she was motivated by grief and frustration with the stringent ""zero Covid"" policies that have been enforced for nearly three years, including citywide lockdowns and constant Covid tests.",陈女士说，她对近三年的严格清零政策非常愤怒和不满，这包括全市范围的封锁和没完没了的核酸检测。
"""I really didn't have any specific slogans and demands,"" she said. ""It was more about the pent-up pain of so many years.""","""其实我没有具体口号没有具体诉求，""她说。""更多的是被压抑了这么多年的痛苦。"""
"Officials appear to be trying to quietly address the most common of grievances about China's Covid restrictions, which have disrupted life, schooling and business.",对于那些引发了最大反感的扰乱生活、上学和商业的防疫措施，官员似乎正试图低调解决问题。
"Many residents have complained about a 20-point set of rules issued by the government on Nov. 11, which at first seemed to promise an easing in pandemic restrictions. However, it has made little effect on the ground, where local officials are under enormous pressure to stifle Covid outbreaks.",许多民众都对政府11月11日颁布的二十条规定发出抱怨，这些规定一开始似乎承诺要放松防疫限制，但在施行中收效甚微，负责执行的地方官员仍承受着扑灭疫情的巨大压力。
"Since the protests over the weekend, local governments across China have said that they will stop residents from being locked in their homes any longer than necessary to prevent expanding outbreaks. On Tuesday, an article from Xinhua, the main state news agency, urged officials to show compassion to frustrated residents.",自上周末的抗议活动以来，中国各地政府均表示，在防止疫情扩大传播的前提下，不会让居民在不必要的情况下被锁在家中。周二，主要国家通讯社新华社的一篇文章敦促官员要对沮丧的居民拿出同情心。
"""All areas and departments must be more patient in relieving the anxieties of the public,"" the article said. ""The fight against the pandemic is complex, arduous and repetitive, and we must listen to the sincere voice of the public.""","""各地各部门要更加耐心纾解群众的情绪，""该文章写道。""抗疫斗争具有复杂性、艰巨性、反复性，需要倾听群众心声。"""
"Avoiding any direct mention of the protests by Chinese leaders or in state media is likely a deliberate strategy to try to downplay their significance. In 1989, the students who occupied Tiananmen Square galvanized in fury after an editorial in the People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, condemned them as being infiltrated by agents of turmoil. The unrest this time has not reached that scale, and officials appear to have learned their lesson.",中国领导人或官媒避免直接提及抗议活动，这很可能是刻意为之，目的是淡化其重要性。1989年，在党的喉舌《人民日报》发表社论谴责占领天安门的学生被动乱分子渗透后，学生群情激愤。这次的抗议还没有达到那种程度，官员们似乎也吸取了教训。
"""The moment that the central leadership takes an official line, they are dignifying the protests with an official response and admitting that they must be reckoned with, which gives them a status that they would rather deny them,"" Prof. Hurst of Cambridge University said.","""一旦公开表态，中央领导层的官方回应就会彰显抗议的重要性，等于承认抗议必须得到重视，他们宁愿否认这种重要性，""剑桥大学的赫斯特教授表示。"
"In Shanghai, Beijing and other cities, the police have bundled away some protesters. Some have been released after a couple of days in detention. Particular attention has been paid to university students. At Tsinghua University, a prestigious school in Beijing, shouts rang out from a crowd of hundreds of students for ""democracy and rule of law"" and ""freedom of expression"" in what was likely the boldest campus protest.","在京沪等城市，警方已抓捕部分抗议者。一些人在被拘留几天后获释。大学生尤其受到关注。在北京的名校清华大学，数以百计的学生在可能是最为大胆的一场校园抗议中发出了要求""民主法治""和""言论自由""的呼声。"
"Tsinghua's administrators said Sunday that free buses would be available from this week to take students leaving early for their winter break to train stations and airports, a step that may have been intended to defuse fresh protests.",清华大学校方周日表示，从本周起学生可以提前离校放寒假，并免费送学生前往火车站和机场，此举可能是为了化解新的抗议活动。
"In China, such a response is considered restrained. But that may not last, and it does not mean that the Communist Party authorities will treat all protesters with leniency. Instead of speaking out directly, the party has allowed loyalists on social media to depict the protesters as pawns, witting or unwitting, of Western efforts to destabilize China and discredit its ""zero Covid"" policies.",在中国，这种反应被认为是克制的。但这种克制可能不会持续太久，也不意味着中共当局会宽大处理所有抗议者。中共没有直接发声，而是放任社交媒体上的效忠派将抗议者描绘为西方企图破坏中国稳定、诋毁清零政策的棋子，无论他们是有意还是无意。
"Since Monday, a growing chorus of these online commentators have tied the protests to ""color revolution,"" a term borrowed from Russia to describe purported Western-backed plots to sow insurrection in rival states. Some have claimed the protesters are acolytes of those who shook Hong Kong in 2019, prompting Mr. Xi to impose a national security law there and a sweeping crackdown on anti-government activists.","自周一以来，网上越来越多的评论将抗议与""颜色革命""联系到一起，这是借用了俄罗斯的话术，用来形容西方支持的在敌对国家播撒叛乱的阴谋。一些人声称，这些抗议者与2019年撼动香港的抗议者是一丘之貉，当年的抗议促使习近平在香港实施国安法，并对反政府活动人士进行全面镇压。"
"""Their style in stirring up trouble is the typical color revolution way,"" said one commentary about the weekend protests that spread on unofficial Chinese websites and social media. Protest leaders, it said, ""were using their worst malice to agitate members of the public who don't understand their true nature especially university students and intellectuals whose heads are stuffed with Western ideas to join in.""","""他们闹事表态的风格，是典型的颜色革命手法，""一篇在中国非官媒网站及社交媒体上传播的关于周末抗议的评论文章写道。该文称，抗议领袖""以最坏的恶意鼓动不明真相的群体(尤其是大学生和部分满脑子西方思维的知识分子)参与其中""。"
"In previous years, the authorities' intimidation and the heavy police presence would likely have been enough to douse any incipient protest movement. This time, some protesters are vowing to keep pressing the Chinese government. On social media groups operating beyond China's censorship firewall, they have swapped ideas for moving around in smaller clusters, using multiple phones, and figuring out how to track and share information about the movements of police.",在此前多年时间里，当局的恐吓和大量警力到场可能足以平息任何刚刚开始的抗议。但这一次，一些抗议者誓要向中国政府继续施压。在中国审查防火墙之外的社交媒体群组中，他们讨论了一些想法，比如以更小的规模行动，使用多部手机，还有研究如何追踪和分享警方行动的信息。
"But Mr. Xi's security options are far from exhausted. China has about 2 million regular police officers by some measures, relatively few for its 1.4 billion people but also a million or more People's Armed Police troops trained in suppressing unrest, as well as legions of security guards and auxiliary police officers. Ultimately, there is also the Chinese military. And as in the crackdown in Hong Kong, the Chinese authorities may make more arrests after the tumult subsides.",但习近平的维稳手段远没到用尽。中国有大约200万正规警力——某种程度上比起14亿人口来说相对较少——但还有可能超过100万受过镇压训练的中国人民武装警察部队，以及大批保安和辅警。最后，还有军队。与香港的镇压行动一样，中国当局可能会在骚乱平息后逮捕更多人。
"Edward Luo, a 23-year old who watched the protest in Shanghai on Sunday, said he was a student in Hong Kong during the 2019 protests and was worried that the young demonstrators in Shanghai did not grasp the risks they faced.",周日在上海围观抗议的23岁男子爱德华·罗(音)表示，2019年抗议期间他在香港念书，他担心上海的年轻示威者尚未意识到自己面临的风险。
"""I think that some people were unafraid, and there were some students who maybe don't understand how much pressure this state can pile on them,"" he said. ""Like a newborn calf that isn't afraid of a tiger.""","""我觉得，有些人是不怕的，还有一些学生，他可能也不知道这个国家能对他施加什么压力。""他说。""初生牛犊不怕虎的那种感觉吧。"""
They went to their first demonstrations. They chanted their first protest slogans. They had their first encounters with the police.,他们参加了自己的第一次示威。喊出了自己的第一个抗议口号。经历了自己与警察的第一次冲突。
"Then they went home, shivering in disbelief at how they had challenged the most powerful authoritarian government in the world and the most iron-fisted leader China has seen in decades.",后来他们回到家中，浑身发抖，不敢相信自己竟然挑战了世界上最强大的威权主义政府和中国几十年来最铁腕的领导人。
"Young Chinese are protesting the country's harsh ""zero-Covid"" policy and even urging its top leader, Xi Jinping, to step down. It's something China hasn't seen since 1989, when the ruling Communist Party brutally cracked down on the pro-democracy demonstrators, mostly college students. No matter what happens in the days and weeks ahead, the young protesters presented a new threat to the rule of Mr. Xi, who has eliminated his political opponents and cracked down on any voice that challenges his rule.","中国的年轻人正在抗议严厉的""新冠清零""政策，甚至喊出了让最高领导人习近平下台的口号。这是中国自1989年以来从未有过的情况，那年，执政的中共残酷镇压了要求民主的示威者，其中大部分是学生。无论未来几天或几周发生什么，年轻的抗议者给习近平的统治带来了新的挑战。习近平已在统治期间消灭了自己的政治对手，压制了任何挑战其统治的声音。"
"Such public dissent was unimaginable until a few days ago. These same young people, when they mentioned Mr. Xi online, used euphemisms like ""X,"" ""he"" or ""that person,"" afraid to even utter the president's name. They put up with whatever the government put them through: harsh pandemic restrictions, high unemployment rates, fewer books available to read, movies to watch and games to play.","直到几天前，这种公开表达异见的方式还是令人难以想象的。同样的年轻人在网上只能用""X""、""他""或""那个人""等间接说法提习近平，甚至不敢说出他的名字。他们忍受着政府让他们经受的各种痛苦:严厉的疫情防控措施，高失业率，可读的书、可看的电影、可玩的游戏越来越少。"
Then something cracked.,后来有人忍不住了。
"After nearly three long years of ""zero Covid,"" which has turned into a political campaign for Mr. Xi, China's future looks increasingly bleak. The economy is in its worst shape in decades. Mr. Xi's foreign policy has antagonized many countries. His censorship policy, in addition to quashing challenges to his authority, has killed nearly all fun.","近三年的""新冠清零""已变成了一场为习近平而办的政治运动，中国的未来似乎越来越不乐观。经济正处于几十年来最糟糕的状态。习近平的外交政策已得罪了许多国家。他的审查做法不仅压制了对他权威的挑战，也几乎扼杀了所有的乐趣。"
"As a popular Weibo post put it, Chinese people are getting by with books published 20 years ago, music released a decade ago, travel photos from five years ago, income earned last year, frozen dumplings from a lockdown three months ago, Covid tests from yesterday, and a freshly baked Soviet joke from today.",正如一条走红的微博所言，中国人靠20年前出的书、10年前流行的音乐、五年前拍的旅游照片、去年挣的钱、三个月前封控时买的冻饺子、昨天的核酸检测结果和今天刚出炉的苏联笑话过活。
"""I think all of these have reached a tipping point,"" said Miranda, a journalist in Shanghai who participated in the protest on Saturday evening. ""If you don't do anything about it, you could really explode.""","""我觉得这些事情他真的已经到了一个临界点，""参加了周六晚间抗议活动的上海记者米兰达说。""就是你不再去做一些什么的话，人是真的会要爆炸的。"""
"In the last few days, in interviews with more than a dozen young people who protested in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan, I heard of a burst of pent-up anger and frustration with how the government implements ""zero Covid."" But their anger and despair goes beyond that, all the way to questioning the rule of Mr. Xi.","在过去几天里，我采访了十多名参加上海、北京、南京、成都、广州和武汉抗议的年轻人，听他们发泄在政府""新冠清零""措施下积压的愤怒和沮丧。但他们的愤怒和绝望并不止于此，而是直指习近平的统治。"
"Two of these people said that they don't plan to have children, a new way to protest among young Chinese at a time when Beijing is encouraging more births. At least four of the protesters said that they were planning to emigrate. One of them refused to look for a job after being laid off by a video-game company in the aftermath of a government crackdown on the industry last year.",两名接受采访的人说，他们不打算要孩子。在中国政府鼓励多生育的时候，这是中国年轻人抗议的一种新方式。至少有四名抗议者说，他们正在打算移民。其中一人在去年政府对电子游戏行业进行整顿期间被一家电子游戏公司解雇后拒绝再找工作。
"They went to the protests because they wanted to let the government know how they felt about being tested constantly, locked inside their apartments or kept away from family and friends in the Covid dragnet. And they wanted to show solidarity for fellow protesters.",他们参加抗议活动是因为要让政府知道，他们对不断地做核酸、关在家里，或受防疫措施限制远离家人和朋友的感受。他们想向其他抗议者展示团结。
"They are members of a generation known as Mr. Xi's children, the nationalistic ""little pinks"" who defend China on Weibo, Facebook and Twitter. The protesters represent a small percentage of Chinese in their 20s and early 30s. By standing up to the government, they defied the perception of their generation. Some older Chinese people said that the protesters made them feel more hopeful about the country's future.","他们属于""习近平的孩子""一代，也就是那些在微博、Facebook和Twitter上捍卫中国的民族主义""小粉红""。抗议者代表了一小部分20多岁到30岁出头的中国人。他们站出来反对政府，颠覆了人们对他们这代人的看法。一些年纪较大的中国人说，这些抗议者让他们对国家的未来感到更有希望了。"
"Zhang Wenmin, a former investigative journalist known under her pen name Jiang Xue, wrote on Twitter that she was moved to tears by the bravery of the protesters. ""It's hard for people who haven't lived in China in the past three to four years to imagine how much fear these people had to overcome to take to the streets, to shout, 'Give me liberty, or give me death,'"" she wrote. ""Amazing. Love you all!""","江雪曾是一名调查记者，她在Twitter上写道，抗议者的勇敢让她感动得流泪。""近三、四年没有在中国生活的人，可能难以想象，那些走上街头，喊出'不自由，毋宁死'的人，要克服多大的恐惧，""她写道。""太了不起了。爱你们!"""
"As first time marchers, most of them did not know what to expect. A Beijing protester said that she was so tense that she felt physically and emotionally exhausted the next day. More than one person told me that they needed a day to collect their thoughts before they could talk. At least three cried in our interviews.",他们是第一次参加抗议，其中的大多数人都不知道会发生什么。北京的一名抗议者说，她非常紧张，第二天仍感到身心俱疲。不止一个人告诉我，他们花了一天时间让自己镇定下来后，才能接受采访。至少有三个人在采访中哭了。
"They are proud, scared and conflicted about their experiences. They have different views about how politically explicit their slogans should be, but they all said that they found shouting the slogans cathartic.",他们对自己经历感到自豪、害怕又矛盾。虽然他们对自己喊出的口号应该在政治上多么明确持不同看法，但他们都说，他们发现喊口号是一种宣泄。
"Miranda, who has been a journalist for eight years, said that she couldn't stop crying when she shouted with the crowd, ""freedom of speech"" and ""freedom of press."" ""It was the freest moment since I became a journalist,"" she said, her voice cracking.","当了八年记者的米兰达说，当她和人群一起高喊""言论自由""、""新闻自由""时，她止不住哭了。""那是我做媒体工作以来感觉最自由的一刻吧，""她说，她的声音有点颤抖。"
"All the people I interviewed asked me to use only their first name, family name or English name to protect their safety. They had felt a relative safety when marching with others just days earlier, but none dared to put their name to comments that would be published.",为了安全，所有接受我采访的人都要求只用他们的名或姓、或英文名。就在几天前，当他们和其他人一起示威时，他们曾有过一种相对安全的感觉，但没人敢在公开发表的文章中实名置评。
"The slogans that they recalled chanting were all over the place, illustrating the wide frustration with their lives. ""End the lockdown!"" ""Freedom of speech!"" ""Give back my movies!""","他们回忆自己喊出的口号各种各样，显示出他们对自己生活的普遍不满。""结束封控!""""言论自由!""""我要电影!"""
Quite a few of them were taken aback by how political the Saturday protest in Shanghai turned out to be.,不少人对上海上周六的抗议活动变得带有政治色彩感到惊讶。
"They were equally surprised, if not more, when more people returned on Sunday to request the release of protesters who had been detained hours earlier.",对于有更多的人周日返回抗议地点，要求释放几个小时前被拘留的抗议者，他们同样感到惊讶——如果不是更惊讶的话。
"All six Shanghai protesters I spoke with thought that they were going to a vigil on Saturday evening for the 10 victims who died in a fire Thursday in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region in China's west. In the beginning, the atmosphere was relaxed.",我采访的所有六名上海抗议者都以为，他们上周六晚去参加的是一个守夜活动，是为了悼念上周四在新疆自治区首府乌鲁木齐的火灾中死亡的10名遇难者。活动开始时，气氛并不紧张。
"When someone first chanted, ""No more Communist Party,"" the crowd laughed, according to Serena, a college student who is spending her gap year in Shanghai. ""Everyone knew it was the redline,"" she said.","据正在上海进行间隔年的大学生塞雷娜说，当有人第一次喊出""不要共产党""的口号时，人群中很多人笑了。""每个人都知道碰到了红线，""她说。"
"Then it became increasingly charged. When someone yelled, ""Xi Jinping, step down!"" and ""C.C.P., step down!"" the shouts were the loudest, according to Serena and other protesters who were also there.","后来，气氛逐渐升温。据塞雷娜和其他在场的抗议者说，有人喊出""习近平下台!""、""共产党下台!""的口号后，人们跟着喊的声音最大。"
"In Beijing, a marketing professional in her mid-20s with the surname Wu told her fellow protesters not to shout those politically explicit slogans because that would guarantee a crackdown. Instead, she shouted slogans that urged the government to implement the rule of law and release detained Shanghai protesters.",在北京，20多岁的吴姓营销人员呼吁和她一起抗议的同伴不要喊带有明显政治色彩的口号，因为那样肯定会导致镇压。相反，她喊了要求政府依法治国的口号，也喊了要求释放被拘留的上海抗议者的口号。
"A protester in Chengdu and one in Guangzhou, separated by 1,000 miles, both said that they were stopped from shouting slogans that other demonstrators deemed too political and were told to stick to the Covid-related demands.",成都的一名抗议者和与成都相距近2000公里的广州的一名抗议者说，当其他示威者认为他们喊的口号太过政治时，他们受到了阻止，其他人叫他们把诉求保持在与新冠病毒有关的要求上。
"For many of them, this weekend was their first brush with the police. A protester named Xiaoli in Chengdu said that she had never seen so many police in her life. After being chased by them, she said that she could hear her heart beating fast when she passed by officers on her way home.",对他们中的许多人来说，这个周末是他们第一次与警察发生冲突。成都一名叫小丽(音)的抗议者说，她有生以来从没见过这么多警察。她说，被警察驱散后，她在回家的路上看到警察时，会听到自己的心跳加快。
"It was clear that many protesters blame Mr. Xi for the extremely unpopular ""zero-Covid"" policy. A young Shanghai professional with the surname Zhang said that Mr. Xi's norm-breaking third term, secured at last month's party congress, spelled the end of China's progress. ""We all gave up our illusions,"" he said.","很明显，许多抗议者把极不受欢迎的""新冠清零""政策归咎于习近平。上海一名姓张的年轻上班族说，习近平在上个月的二十大上获得了打破常规的第三个任期，标志着中国进步的终结。""大家都知道我们要放弃幻想，""他说。"
"He cried when he mentioned an old man's question during this year's Shanghai lockdown, ""Why has our country come to this?"" Mr. Zhang, who said that he grew up poor in a village, was grateful for the government's assistance in his education. ""I thought we would only move upward,"" he added.","他提到今年上海封城期间一位老先生的遭遇时哭了。""老先生说了一句我们的国家为什么变成这个样子?""张先生说。他在贫穷的农村长大，很感激政府为他提供了接受高等教育的帮助。""我觉得我们会越来越好，""他补充道。"
"The young protesters are most conflicted about the impact of their actions. They felt powerless about changing the system as long as Mr. Xi and the Communist Party are in power. They believe that many people in the public supported them because the unyielding Covid rules have violated what they see as baseline norms of Chinese society. Once the government relaxes the policy, they worry, the public's support for protests would evaporate.",年轻的抗议者们对他们的行动会有什么影响的看法最矛盾。他们觉得，只要习近平和中共掌权，他们就无力改变体制。他们相信许多公众支持他们，因为固执地执行新冠清零政策违反了他们眼里中国社会的基本常态。他们担心公众对抗议活动的支持会在政府放松政策后消失。
"At the same time, some of them argued that their protests would make the public aware of their rights.",与此同时，他们中的一些人也认为，抗议活动将使公众意识到自己的权利。
"No one knows what the protests will become a moment in history, or a footnote. The official state media has kept quiet, though some pro-government social media bloggers have pointed fingers at ""foreign forces."" Police have enhanced their presence on the streets and called or visited protesters in an attempt to intimidate them.","没有人知道抗议活动会变成什么——是历史的一个时刻，还是一个注脚。官方媒体一直保持沉默，尽管一些亲政府的社交媒体博主已将矛头指向了""外国势力""。警方已加强了街头的警力，还试图通过打电话或上门来恐吓抗议者。"
"I asked Bruce, a Shanghai finance worker in his 20s, whether the protests meant that people have changed their view of Mr. Xi. He responded, ""It was probably not because the public's opinion of him changed, but because those who are critical of him have spoken up.""","我问在上海从事金融工作的20多岁的布鲁斯，这些抗议活动是否意味着人们对习近平的看法发生了改变。他回答说，""这一次不是大家的看法和态度改变了，而是有看法和持批评态度的人敢勇敢地说出来了。"""
"""Lift the lockdown,"" the protesters screamed in a city in China's far west. On the other side of the country, in Shanghai, demonstrators held up sheets of blank white paper, turning them into an implicit but powerful sign of defiance. One protester, who was later detained by the police, was carrying only flowers.","""解封，""中国西部一座城市的抗议者喊道。在中国另一边的上海，示威者高举一张张白纸，将其变为一种含蓄而有力的反抗标志。一名抗议者只带了鲜花，后来被警方拘留。"
"Over the weekend, protests against China's strict Covid restrictions ricocheted across the country in a rare case of nationwide civil unrest.",上周末，中国出现罕见的全国性动荡，各地纷纷爆发反对严格新冠封锁的抗议活动。
"On Monday, one group supporting the protesters issued online calls for limited numbers of demonstrators to gather at the People's Square in Shanghai and near a subway stop in northwest Beijing in the evening. But video shared from the two sites, identifiable from the buildings and signs in the background, showed a heavy security presence, with police buses and cars lining the streets.",周一，一个支持抗议者的团体在网上发出呼吁，号召有限数量的示威者当晚于上海人民广场和北京西北部一处地铁站附近集会。但从这两个地点(背景建筑物和标志可识别)发出的视频显示，现场有大量安保人员，街道两旁都是警方的大小车辆。
"In the eastern city of Hangzhou, a crowd of people gathered at a shopping mall but were closely watched by an even larger group of uniformed police officers. A woman was screaming as several of the officers took her away, according to videos circulating online. Onlookers shouted at the police.",在东部城市杭州，人群聚集在一处购物中心，但有更多穿制服的警察在密切监视。根据网上流传的视频，一名女子在被多名警察抓走时尖叫不止。围观者向警察大喊。
"Some demonstrators this weekend had gone so far as to call for the Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping, to step down. Many were fed up with Mr. Xi, who in October secured a precedent-defying third term as the party's general secretary, and his ""zero-Covid"" policy, which continues to disrupt everyday life, hurt livelihoods and isolate the country.",上周末的一些示威者甚至要求共产党及其领导人习近平下台。许多人对在10月打破先例获得中共总书记第三任期的习近平忍无可忍，他的新冠清零政策持续扰乱日常生活，损害人民生计，并让国家陷于孤立。
"The Chinese government on Monday blamed ""forces with ulterior motives"" for linking a deadly fire in the western Xinjiang region to strict Covid measures, a key driver as the protests spread across the country.","周一，中国政府指责将西部新疆地区的一场致命火灾与严格的防疫措施联系起来是""别有用心""，火灾是抗议在全国蔓延的主要原因。"
"The 1.4 billion-plus residents of China remain at the mercy of the stringent policy. It is designed to stamp out infections by relying on snap lockdowns of apartment buildings and sometimes whole cities or regions, as well as forcing lengthy quarantines and a litany of tests on residents.",中国超过14亿居民仍受严厉政策的摆布。这些政策的目的在于通过对公寓楼——有时是整座城市或片区——迅速封锁，以及漫长的强制隔离和对居民的反复检测来消灭感染。
"Outside China, the rest of the world has adapted to the virus and is near normalcy. Take soccer's premier event, the World Cup. Thousands of people from across the globe have assembled in Qatar and are cheering on their teams, shoulder-to-shoulder, without masks, in packed stadiums.",在中国之外，世界其他地区已经与病毒共存，基本恢复了常态。就拿顶级足球赛事世界杯来说，全球无数民众都相聚卡塔尔，在拥挤的体育场摩肩接踵，不戴口罩，为他们的球队加油。
"China's approach won praise during the beginning of the pandemic, and there is no doubt it has saved lives. But now that approach looks increasingly outdated. Almost three years after the coronavirus emerged, the contrast between China and the rest of the world couldn't be starker.",中国的防疫在疫情初期赢得了赞誉，这种措施无疑挽救了生命。但它日渐显得过时。新冠病毒出现近三年后，中国与全世界的对比已再明显不过。
Here's what you need to know about the situation in China.,以下是需要了解的关于中国的情况。
A deadly fire in China's far west has infuriated protesters.,中国西部的一场致命火灾激怒了抗议者。
"The news spread fast on the Chinese internet. Ten people died on Thursday after a fire in an apartment building in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, a region of 25 million people that had been under lockdown for more than three months. (The region has previously been in the spotlight over China's mass internment of its Muslim population.)",消息在中国互联网上迅速传开。周四在新疆首府乌鲁木齐的一栋公寓楼发生火灾，造成十人死亡。拥有2500万人口的新疆已被封锁三个多月。(该地区此前曾因中国对当地穆斯林人口的大规模拘禁而备受关注。)
"Many Chinese suspected that Covid restrictions which can include makeshift barricades and blockaded emergency exits to keep people indoors had hampered the rescue or prevented residents from seeking shelter from the fire. Many Urumqi residents took to the streets, chanting ""end lockdowns.""","许多中国人质疑是新冠封锁——包括将人困在室内的临时路障和紧急出口封锁——阻碍了救援，让居民无法逃生。许多乌鲁木齐市民走上街头，高呼""解封""。"
"Soon, protests erupted across the country.",很快，抗议活动席卷全国。
"In Shanghai, China's largest city, residents gathered at an intersection of Urumqi Road, named after the city in Xinjiang, to mourn the dead. ""We want freedom,"" they chanted, and some went on to call for Mr. Xi's resignation.","在中国最大城市上海，居民聚集在以这座新疆城市命名的乌鲁木齐中路的十字路口哀悼死者。""我们要自由，""他们喊道，一些人进而要求习近平下台。"
"""Those victims, how they died, we are all clear about that. Isn't that right?"" said the protester with the flowers, according to a video posted on social media, an apparent reference to the tragedy in Urumqi. Soon after, the man, nicknamed ""Shanghai Flower Boy"" on social media, was taken away by police, the video showed. The Times verified the location of the video as Urumqi Road in Shanghai.","""那些遇难者，他们是怎么死的，我们都很清楚。对不对?""根据社交媒体上的一段视频，一名手持鲜花的抗议者显然在说乌鲁木齐的悲剧。视频显示，不久之后，这名在社交媒体上被称为""上海鲜花男孩""的男子就被警方带走。经时报核实，该视频的拍摄地点正是上海乌鲁木齐中路。"
"Among those who were taken away was a BBC reporter, who was later released.",被带走的人当中包括一名BBC记者，但后来被释放。
"Demonstrators also gathered in the country's capital, with many students assembling at Tsinghua University in northwest Beijing to denounce restrictions on their ability to get around. Hundreds of protesters also marched in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the pandemic originated in late 2019. Crowds have also congregated in Chengdu, a city in the southwest of the country.",示威活动也出现在首都北京，位于该市西北部的清华大学有许多学生聚集起来，谴责对他们自由行动的限制措施。在中部城市武汉，也就是这次大流行在2019年末的起源地，也出现了数百名抗议者。同样的情况还发生在西南城市成都。
"On Monday, a government official addressed the claim that there was a link between the Urumqi fire and virus restrictions. ""On social media there are forces with ulterior motives that relate this fire with the local response to Covid-19,"" Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in response to a question at a regular press briefing.","周一，一名政府官员回应了乌鲁木齐火灾与防疫措施之间存在联系的说法。外交部发言人赵立坚在例行记者会上回答相关问题时表示:""在社交媒体上，一些别有用心的势力将防疫与这场火灾扯为一谈。"""
China's economy has been hurt by the restrictions.,这些限制措施损害了中国经济。
"The disruptions to daily life have hammered businesses both large and small, from the company that makes iPhones to neighborhood shops and restaurants.",从制造苹果手机的公司到社区里的店铺和餐馆，日常生活的中断对大大小小的企业都造成了冲击。
"A lockdown at a Foxconn facility in Zhengzhou in central China showed how the policy can have global ramifications. After workers were pulled out of their jobs to limit a Covid outbreak, production dropped. That, in turn, forced Apple to warn that its sales would fall short of expectations.",借由郑州富士康工厂的停工，可以看到该政策是如何产生全球影响的。为了限制新冠疫情将工人调离工作岗位后，产量下降。这反过来又迫使苹果警告销售额将低于预期。
"To avoid similar problems, other multinational companies have been looking to expand production outside China.",为了避免遭遇类似的问题，其他跨国公司一直在寻求扩大在中国以外的产能。
"On the main streets of towns and cities in China, lockdowns have reduced foot traffic, hurting businesses that are vital to urban employment.",在中国城镇的主要街头，封锁导致人流量的减少，损害了对城市就业至关重要的企业。
"According to the latest data, the Chinese economy grew 3.9 percent in the three months that ended in September. But that was much slower than the government's target of 5.5 percent for 2022, and some economists are forecasting that it will fall even more in the year's final months.",根据最新数据，中国经济在截至9月的三个月里增长了3.9%。但这远低于政府设定的2022年5.5%的目标，一些经济学家预测，在今年最后几个月，降幅还会更大。
"For investors worried about China's economy, it has been a guessing game as to when, if ever, the restrictions will be rolled back. Many had expected an announcement at October's Communist Party congress. But instead, Mr. Xi doubled down. The immediate market reaction on Monday was muted, with stocks in Asia falling about 1 percent.",对于担心中国经济的投资者来说，限制何时取消(如果会取消的话)一直像是一个让人捉摸不定的问题。许多人曾预计，10月共产党代表大会上会宣布这一消息。但习近平反而进一步强调坚持现有的防疫政策。周一市场反应平淡，亚洲股市下跌约1%。
"Officials have tried to fine tune the ""zero-Covid"" policy.","官员们曾试图对""清零""政策进行微调。"
"Earlier in November, the government said it would ease some of the rules, even as it remained committed to the policy. The shift was modest, but it was a sign that the authorities were cognizant of the toll the constant disruptions were having on the economy.",11月初，政府曾表示将放宽部分规定，尽管仍坚持该政策不动摇。虽然变化不大，但它表明，当局意识到了持续的干扰对经济的破坏。
"Quarantine restrictions were loosened for overseas travelers, as was a penalty system for airlines bringing in travelers with Covid. Within the country, the authorities cut back, albeit slightly, contact tracing and eliminated some other measures.",新规放宽了对海外旅客的检疫限制，以及对于把感染新冠的旅客带入境的航空公司的处罚。国内方面，当局减少了对接触者的追踪——尽管力度很小，另外还取消了其他一些措施。
Financial markets initially took it as a positive sign that heralded the eventual withdrawal of the policy. But it was not to be.,金融市场最初认为这是一个积极的信号，预示着该政策终将取消。但事实并非如此。
"With the looser restrictions came more Covid cases that escalated into outbreaks. The daily number of reported cases is at its highest point of the pandemic. Most Chinese have never been exposed to the virus, and a vaccination drive has largely stalled. Officials quickly backpedaled. By mid-November, a third of China's population and areas that generate two-fifths of its economic output were back under partial or complete lockdowns, according to an estimate from the Japanese brokerage Nomura.",随着限制的放松，感染病例增加，疫情升级。中国每日报告的病例数正处于大流行以来的最高点。大多数中国人从未接触过这种病毒，疫苗接种活动基本上处于停滞不前的状态。官方很快就变卦了。根据日本券商野村的估计，到11月中旬，中国三分之一的人口和占经济产出五分之二的地区重新处于部分或完全封锁的状态。
"In Shanghai, a vigil grew into a street protest where many held blank sheets of white paper in a symbol of tacit defiance.",在上海，一场守夜活动演变成街头抗议，许多人举着白纸，展示了不言而喻的反抗姿态。
"In Beijing, students at Tsinghua University raised signs showing a math equation devised by the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann, whose surname in Chinese is a homonym for ""free man.""","在北京，清华大学学生以俄罗斯物理学家亚历山大·弗里德曼设计的数学方程式为标语，弗里德曼的中文发音与""自由人""(free man)相近。"
"And on China's suppressed internet, where positive messages abound and negative ones are scrubbed, protesters resorted to irony: They posted walls of text filled with the Chinese characters for ""yes,"" ""good"" and ""correct"" to signal their discontent while evading censors.","在中国受到压制的互联网上，正面信息比比皆是，负面信息被抹杀，这让抗议者诉诸讽刺:他们写上满屏的""是""、""好""和""对""等字以表达不满，同时逃避审查。"
"These messages elusive, creative and often ironic were among many that captured the tone of protests across China this past weekend, as fury over lockdown measures nearly three years into the pandemic has rapidly developed into one of the boldest displays of dissent against the Chinese authorities in years.",这些难以捉摸、富有创意且通常含有讽刺意味的信息，代表了上周末中国各地抗议活动的基调，疫情暴发近三年，民众对封锁措施的怒火迅速演变为多年来针对中国当局最大胆的异议表达事件之一。
"Some of the protesters went so far as to directly condemn the authorities, denouncing them in sometimes lurid and explicit language or even calling for China's leader, Xi Jinping, to step down. But in a country where the authorities have very little tolerance for open dissent, many communicated through subtler methods, and among the most prominent were the blank sheets of white paper used in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities.",一些抗议者甚至直接谴责当局，有时还发出惊人而直白的批判，甚至要求中国领导人习近平下台。但在这个当局几乎从不容忍公开异议的国家，许多人选择了更微妙的沟通办法，其中最突出的就是上海、北京等城市出现的白纸。
"The wave of protests in at least a dozen cities erupted after a fire in the far western region of Xinjiang on Thursday killed 10 people by official count, a toll that many suspected was linked to Covid restrictions that have confined people to their homes. Demonstrators used the white sheets to mourn those lost white is a common funeral color in China and to express an anger understood implicitly by millions who have suffered under pandemic restrictions.",官方称，周四西部偏远地区新疆的火灾造成10人死亡，此后至少十几座城市爆发了抗议浪潮，许多人质疑是将人困在家中的新冠封锁导致了悲剧发生。示威者用白纸——中国葬礼普遍使用白色——哀悼死者，并表达出能让无数深受疫情管制之苦的民众不言而明的愤怒。
"The display of wordless papers ""means 'we are the voiceless, but we are also powerful,'"" said Hazel Liu, a 29-year-old film producer who attended the vigil along the Liangma River in Beijing on Sunday.","无字纸张的展示""意味着'我们是无声的，但我们也是有力量的，'""29岁的电影制片人海兹尔·刘(音)说，她在周日参加了北京亮马河边的守夜活动。"
Mourners also used blank white sheets on Urumqi Road in Shanghai on Saturday evening. One resident said that the purpose of the papers initially was to signal to the police that those gathered were going to mourn those lost while saying nothing.,周六晚间，哀悼者也在上海的乌鲁木齐中路举起白纸。一位居民说，这些纸张本来的意思是要告诉警方，聚集在一起的人将用沉默哀悼逝者。
"But as more people gathered, the feelings of grief and frustration morphed into broader calls for government accountability. By late evening, hundreds of protesters brought their own blank papers, raising them to the sky and chanting for an end to the Covid restrictions.",但随着聚集的人群越来越多，悲痛和沮丧转变为问责政府的更广泛呼声。到深夜，数以百计的抗议者都自带白纸，高举起来，喊着解封的口号。
"""People have a common message,"" said Xiao Qiang, a researcher on internet freedom at the University of California, Berkeley. ""They know what they want to express, and authorities know too, so people don't need to say anything. If you hold a blank sheet, then everyone knows what you mean.""","""民众有一个共同的诉求，""加州大学伯克利分校互联网自由研究员萧强表示。""他们知道自己想表达什么，当局也知道，所以人们什么都不用说。如果你拿着一张白纸，那么人人都知道你想说什么。"""
"Some protesters told The New York Times that the white papers took inspiration from a Soviet-era joke, in which a dissident accosted by the police for distributing leaflets in a public square reveals the fliers to be blank. When asked, the dissident replies that there is no need for words because ""everyone knows.""","一些抗议者告诉《纽约时报》，白纸的灵感来自苏联时代的一个笑话，讲得是一位异见者因在公共广场散发传单而被警察质询，结果发现传单上什么都没写。在被问话时，这位异见者回答说，不需要写什么，因为""人人都懂""。"
"Anti-government demonstrators in Hong Kong also used blank paper in 2020, days after a national security law was passed to quash dissent. After officials and police officers repeatedly warned against chanting political slogans, many held the blank sheets of paper in shopping malls as the city was being scrubbed of protest graffiti.",2020年，在镇压异议的国安法通过的前几天，香港的反政府示威者也用过白纸抗议。当时官员和警察一再警告不准高喊政治口号，城市里的抗议涂鸦也在被抹去，许多人就在商场举起了白纸。
"During the new wave of protests in China, videos and photos of blank white papers have gone viral outside the highly censored Chinese internet. The hashtag ""A4Revolution"" a reference to the size of the paper sheets began trending on Twitter over the weekend. On Facebook and Instagram, users changed their profile photos to blank papers in support of the protesters.","在中国新一轮的抗议中，白纸抗议的视频和图片在受到严格审查的中国互联网之外迅速传播开来。周末，""A4革命""(A4Revolution，A4指的是纸张尺寸;中文也称""白纸革命"")的话题开始在Twitter上流行。在Facebook和Instagram，有用户将头像改为白纸以支持抗议者。"
"Some have pushed the protests in other creative directions. A statement that appeared to have been sent by one of China's largest stationery companies circulated online, saying that the company would suspend sales of A4 paper to ""safeguard national security and stability."" The company was forced to announce on its social media account that the message was fabricated and that all operations remained normal.","一些情况还给抗议带来了意想不到的后果。一份似乎由中国最大的文具公司之一发出的声明在网上流传，称该公司将暂停销售A4纸，以""维护国家安全稳定""。该公司被迫在其社交媒体账号上宣布这一信息为捏造，公司在正常经营。"
The muted defiance of the protests often innocuous on the surface has handed the police the nebulous task of deciding what crosses the line.,这些抗议的无声反抗表面上看起来往往无伤大雅，导致警方难以辨明其性质到底有没有越界。
"At a Shanghai mall on Sunday afternoon, a man with glasses held up a sign with the words ""You know what I want to say."" Nearby, on Urumqi Road, another man stood in the middle of the street raising a flower into the sky. ""What is there to be afraid of?"" he asked bystanders who were filming on their phones.","周日下午，一名戴眼镜的男子在上海一家商场举着牌子，上面写着""你知道我要说什么""。在附近的乌鲁木齐中路，另一名男子站在马路中央，向天空举起一朵花。""有什么好怕的?""他反问正在用手机拍摄的旁观者。"
He was soon tackled by a crew of police officers and shuttled into a car.,他很快被一群警察制服，并被押入一辆汽车。
"China's authorities have so far remained silent about the protests, but images from Shanghai on Sunday showed three men in construction attire walking away with the road sign for ""Urumqi Middle Road,"" the site of the protest.","迄今为止，中国当局仍对抗议保持沉默，然而周日从上海传出的照片显示，三名身穿建筑工装的男子抬走了""乌鲁木齐中路""的路牌，那正是抗议发生的地方。"
The move backfired.,此举适得其反。
"By Monday, the severed road sign itself had become a meme. Mocking images playing on the cover of the famed ""Abbey Road"" album circulated online, with the Beatles crossing the street holding the Urumqi road sign.",到周一，被摘下的路标本身也变成了米姆。著名唱片《艾比路》封面的恶搞图在网上流传，正在过马路披头士乐队手里拿的正是那块乌鲁木齐中路的路牌。
"""That's the censorship mechanisms' own doing. They created this situation,"" Professor Xiao said. ""When everyone is suffering from 'zero-Covid' restrictions and anger is so widespread, then any memes will catch.""","""这是审查机制自食其果。是他们造成了这种局面，""萧强说道。""当人人都受新冠封锁之苦，当愤怒情绪已经如此普遍，那任何米姆都能一炮而红。"""
"BEIJING The crowd was hard to make out at first, a dark mass huddled along the Beijing riverbank after sunset. They stood quietly, almost nervously, dozens of people bundled in thick coats beside yellowed willow trees. At their center was a small altar, strewn with candles and flowers, for the 10 people who died in a fire in western China last week.",北京——起初看不出那是一群人，只看到日落后北京的一条河畔有一团黑影。他们静静地站在那里，几乎有点紧张，几十名穿着厚外套的人，站在叶子已黄的柳树旁。人群中间有一个布满蜡烛和鲜花的小祭坛，那是为上周在中国西部一场火灾中死亡的10个人而设的。
"Two hours later, that crowd had swelled into the hundreds, a mass of people marching and chanting for freedom, rule of law, an end to the three years of coronavirus restrictions that have dragged life here to a near standstill. Temperatures were frigid, but people stayed for hours, even outlasting a shift change in the police officers who monitored the whole event Sunday night.",两小时后，人群已增加到数百人，一大群人边走边高呼口号，要求自由、法治，以及结束已实施了三年的新冠病毒防控措施，这些措施让中国人的生活陷入几乎停滞的状态。虽然气温很低，但人们在河边呆了好几个小时，甚至超过了周日晚上在这里监视整件事情的那班警察的执勤换岗时间。
"""We don't want lockdowns, we want freedom!"" the protesters shouted as they wound westward through one of the city's neatly manicured embassy districts, where a Four Seasons hotel stands alongside humble shops selling traditional breakfast crepes. ""Freedom of the press! Freedom of publishing!""","""不要核酸!要自由!""抗议者高呼着口号蜿蜒西行，穿过北京一个有整齐草坪的使馆区，从耸立在出售传统煎饼早餐便利店之间的四季酒店前走过。""要新闻自由!要出版自由!"""
"It was an extraordinary scene, rarely seen anywhere in China, let alone the capital, under Xi Jinping, the country's authoritarian leader. But the elation of the moment was laced with anxiety about what, exactly, was happening. When some people began shouting explicitly political slogans, others urged them to remain more narrowly focused on opposing Covid controls. Even what to call the event depended on who and when you asked was it a protest? Or just a vigil?",这是个不同寻常的场景，很少能在中国其他地方看到，更不用说在威权主义领导人习近平统治下的首都了。但交织在片刻欢欣鼓舞之中的是对正在发生的事情的焦虑。一些人开始高喊带有明确政治色彩的口号后，另一些人劝他们把诉求保持在针对新冠防控措施的更具体事务上。就连如何描述这里发生的事情也取决于你问谁、什么时候问——这是抗议活动吗?还是只是守夜活动?
"The uncertainty mirrored the broader uncertainty of this moment, a potential turning point for not only China's zero Covid strategy but also Mr. Xi's rigid grip on the country he leads. In recent days, protests have erupted across China, from western Urumqi, where the fire broke out, to Shanghai in the east. The excesses of the coronavirus restrictions have united people like no other cause in decades. But in a country where dissent is quickly smothered, and most people have never had the chance to protest, many were unsure what to ask for, let alone what could actually happen.",这种不确定反映了此时此刻更广泛的不确定，这可能是一个潜在的转折点，不仅是对于中国的新冠清零政策，也是就习近平对国家的强硬控制而言。最近几天，从火灾发生的西部城市乌鲁木齐到东部城市上海，中国各地都爆发了抗议活动。遏制新冠病毒的过度措施让人们团结起来，这是几十年来未曾有过的动因。但在一个异见很快就会遭到扼杀、大多数人从来都没有机会抗议的国家，许多人拿不准他们想诉求的东西，更不用说实际会发生什么了。
The only sure thing seemed to be a sense of urgency that this was a rare moment that had to be seized.,唯一能确定的似乎是一种紧迫感，人们意识到这是个必须抓住的难得时刻。
"In Beijing, the demonstrations followed long-simmering discontent. On top of three years of the daily intrusions of zero Covid, much of the city has been under a quasi-lockdown for weeks as infections have soared. Many residents have been ordered not to leave home and most shops are closed. The only crowds are long lines for mandatory Covid tests, required every 48 hours to enter the few public spaces still open.",北京的示威活动是在不满情绪长期积压之后发生的。经历了三年新冠清零给生活几乎每天带来干扰后，随着感染病例上升，北京的大部分地区近几周来还在进行封控。许多居民被命令足不出户，大多数商店都已关门。唯一的人群是接受强制性核酸检测的长龙，北京要求进入少数仍开门的公共场所的人出示48小时内的核酸阴性证明。
"Frustration had already started boiling over earlier in the weekend, as some residents under lockdowns confronted neighborhood officials, demanding to be let out.",不满情绪已在周末早些时候开始沸腾，一些被封控的居民与社区工作人员发生了冲突，要求解封。
"But it was only after protests broke out in other cities Urumqi on Friday night, Shanghai on Saturday that mass mobilization seemed possible in Beijing, too. Many attendees on Sunday seemed in disbelief that it was happening. ""Should we leave?"" people murmured to each other throughout the evening.","但在其他城市爆发了抗议活动(周五晚在乌鲁木齐、周六晚在上海)之后，北京的群众行动似乎才也有了可能。许多参加了周日晚间活动的人似乎都不敢相信这种事情正在发生。""是不是应该走了?""整个晚上，人们都在相互低语。"
"Yet mixed with the disbelief was a sense of giddy solidarity with all the other places Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan and more where similarly unimaginable explosions of pent-up emotion were playing out that night.",不过，难以置信的同时，也有一种与其他发生抗议活动的城市团结一致的令人目眩的感觉，在那天晚上，上海、成都、武汉以及更多地方同样也出现了令人难以想象的压抑情绪的爆发场景。
"""We are all Shanghai people! We are all Xinjiang people!"" people chanted.","""我们都是上海人!我们都是新疆人!""人们高呼。"
"Even the police response added to the feeling that anything could happen. Though the police presence grew throughout the night, officers kept a relative distance at least for the moment filming participants but rarely physically engaging the crowds. Many attendees had expected a quick and fierce suppression, and a common whispered question was when the police might start making arrests.",就连警方的反应也增加了任何事情都可能发生的感觉。尽管整个晚间警力一直在增加，但警察与人群保持着相当的距离——至少目前情况如此，尽管他们在对参与者进行录影，但几乎没有与人群发生身体接触。许多参与者曾预计警方会进行迅速且猛烈的镇压，大家都在低声问的一个共同问题是，警方可能在什么时候开始抓人。
"The unfamiliarity of protest had been clear in the hours before the gathering. As videos of the demonstrations elsewhere in China spread on social media, despite censorship, people began discussing, in encrypted group chats on platforms blocked within China, where to gather in Beijing. A rare protest of several hundred students at Tsinghua University, in western Beijing, early Sunday afternoon fueled excitement.",在集会开始前的几小时里，人们对抗议活动的陌生感就已经很明显了。虽然有审查，但随着中国其他地方的抗议视频在社交媒体上传播，人们开始在中国境内被禁的加密群聊平台讨论在北京的聚集地点。位于北京西郊的清华大学周日下午早些时候发生了罕见的数百名学生抗议活动，增加了人们的兴奋情绪。
"But people reported that the police had already begun encircling one proposed meeting spot for the later gathering, speculating that someone had shared the plans on WeChat, the heavily surveilled Chinese messaging app. Others tried to communicate in code: ""Is anyone planning on going for a walk later?"" Even in the minutes leading up to the arranged meeting time of 9 p.m., people were sending anxious messages asking whether others were really going.","但有消息说，警方已开始包围一个拟议的集会地点，据推测是因为有人在受严密监控的中国即时通讯应用微信上分享了集会计划。其他人则尝试用暗语交流:""有人打算晚间出去散步吗?""甚至在晚上9点的活动开始前的几分钟里，人们仍在焦虑地交换信息，询问其他人是否真会参加。"
"They were. By 9:30 p.m., around 100 people, most appearing to be in their 20s or 30s, had gathered on the northern bank of the Liangma River, around the makeshift altar. Some had come alone, but most were in pairs or small groups. Virtually everyone wore a face mask, as much to hide their identities as for protection. There was no apparent organizer, and for long stretches the crowd stood in expectant, almost awkward, silence, many simply holding their phones aloft to film the scene.",他们真的去了。到晚上9点30分时，大约100人聚集在亮马河北岸的一个临时祭坛周围，他们的年龄似乎大都在20多岁或30多岁之间。有些人是独自来的，但大多数人是几个人结队来的。几乎每个人都戴着口罩，这既是为了隐瞒身份，也是为了保护自己不被病毒感染。没有明显的组织者，而且人群在很长一段时间里只是站在那里，在一种几乎尴尬的沉默中期待着什么，许多人高高地举起手机，将这个场景拍下。
"Then, someone began singing ""L'Internationale,"" the left-wing anthem, and others joined in. ""To create mankind's happiness, we must rely only upon ourselves,"" they sang gently, almost tentatively.","后来，有人开始唱《国际歌》，其他人跟着唱了起来。""要创造人类的幸福，全靠我们自己!""他们几乎犹豫不定地轻声唱道。"
"""This was really unexpected. When we first arrived, no one was here,"" said one woman, Cecilia Meng, who said she and her husband had just emerged from a one-week lockdown at home that afternoon. Of the few other people around, ""we didn't know who was one of us.""","""其实很令人诧异，我们刚来的时候是没有人的，""一名叫塞西莉亚·孟的女子说道。她说她和丈夫周日下午刚可以出门，前一周他们一直在家隔离。至于周围的其他几个人，""好多人都不知道谁是同伴。"""
"But then people approached them after seeing that they were carrying blank white paper, a reference to censorship that has quickly emerged as a symbol of the protests. ""And then we knew they were our partners.""","但后来，人们看到他们手里拿着白纸后走了过来。白纸针对的是审查制度，很快成为这些抗议活动的象征。""我们才知道他们是我们的伙伴。"""
"As the crowd grew, the mood shifted quickly and often, from grief to defiance to humor. One moment, a woman was crying out that she was from Xinjiang, lamenting for her home region. The next, people were jokingly calling out to people on the opposite shore, where a crowd had also gathered, to swim over.",随着人数增多，情绪也在不断发生变化，在悲伤、反抗和幽默之间迅速转化。一名女子在某个时刻大声说，她来自新疆，为家乡感到悲痛。接下来，人们会开玩笑地对聚集在河另一边的人群大喊，叫他们游过来。
"When a police officer told people to stop chanting for an end to lockdowns, the crowd quickly pivoted. ""Continue lockdowns!"" they chanted, in an echo of the sarcasm that had spread online in recent days, as people shared overblown praise for the government to protest censorship. ""I want to do Covid tests!""","一名警官叫人们不要再喊结束封控后，人群迅速改了口号。""继续封控!我要做核酸!""他们高喊道，与最近几天在网上流传的讽刺做法相呼应，人们用夸大赞扬政府的方式抗议审查制度。"
"At certain moments, the protest could have been unfolding anywhere in the world, where people don't face the dangers of speaking their minds. ""Long live the Sitong Bridge hero,"" a small group began chanting as the riverside vigil morphed into the westward march, focusing on a lone protester who, in October, hung two banners from a Beijing overpass denouncing Covid restrictions and calling on Mr. Xi to step down.","在人们不会因说出自己的想法而面临危险的世界其他地方，这种抗议活动可能会在任何时候发生。随着河边的守夜活动变成向西走的游行，一小群人开始高呼口号:""四通桥英雄万岁!""他们指的是一名独自行动的抗议者，10月中旬曾在北京一座立交桥上挂出两条横幅，谴责新冠清零政策，要求习近平下台。"
"But immediately, others shouted them down.",但其他人马上叫他们不要乱喊。
"""Don't yell random slogans!"" they said.","""不要乱喊口号!""他们说。"
"""We don't talk about politics! We're good citizens!"" one man loudly added.","""我们不谈政治!我们是好公民!""一名男子大声补充道。"
"That was perhaps the central tension of the evening. The demonstration was astonishingly bold in the mere fact of its existence. But it was also in many ways hyper conservative, undergirded by the participants' knowledge of its fragility. Every move seemed calculated to keep it alive as long as possible.",这也许是当晚的核心矛盾所在。单从抗议活动本身来看，就是非常大胆的举动。但在很多方面也是非常保守的，背后原因是参与者充分了解抗议活动的脆弱。他们的一举一动似乎都经过了深思熟虑，为的是尽可能延长活动的时间。
"Unlike in Shanghai on Saturday, the protesters in Beijing avoided naming Mr. Xi or the Chinese Communist Party. The demonstrations in Shanghai had turned into more violent confrontations, with the police detaining at least two vehicles of people, according to witnesses, though it was unclear if the slogans were the reason.",与上海周六的抗议不同，北京的抗议者避免直接提及习近平或中共的名字。上海的抗议活动已演变成更暴力的对抗，警方逮捕了至少两车人，据目击者说，但不清楚那些口号是否是抓人的原因。
"Hanging over it all was the question of what the point was, in a country where people have grown accustomed to being ruled, not responded to. ""We know that our requests won't be answered. We're just here to express our emotions,"" one participant in Beijing heatedly told an official who engaged with demonstrators around 1 a.m.","所有这些活动面临的一个问题是，在一个人民已经习惯于被政府统治而不是得到回应的国家，抗议的目的是什么。""我们知道我们的诉求不会得到回应，我们就是来表达我们的情绪，""北京的一名参与者激动地对一名官员说，该官员一直在与示威者对话，直到凌晨一点左右。"
"""No, there must be an answer!"" others in the crowd immediately shouted. ""Solve the problems!""","""不行，一定要有回应!""人群中的其他人马上喊道。""要解决问题!"""
"One attendee, a filmmaker who gave only his surname, Wang, said he did not expect much to change because of the protests.",一名仅透露自己姓王、从事电影制作的参与者说，他不指望抗议活动会让政府的做法有多大改变。
"""As Chinese people, our ability to organize is still too weak. We don't have the experience or the knowledge,"" he said. ""This"" the ability to gather at all ""is already really hard-won.""","""我们中国民间人，搞这样组织的能力还是太弱了，没有这种素质，没有经验也没有意识，""他说。""已经很难得了。""他指的是能聚集在一起。"
"And, though the protest lasted longer than many had expected that evening, it may ultimately have been fleeting. As it stretched toward 2 a.m., the number of police officers grew, with several columns marching briskly down the street in matching black fur collars and white face masks, herding the dwindling number of participants into small groups on the sidewalk. In one group, a woman urged everyone to walk away together, so that no one could be picked off alone.",而且，尽管当晚的抗议活动持续的时间超出许多人的预期，但它最终也许仍是短暂的。警察的人数在临近凌晨2点时增加了不少，几支身穿完全一样的黑色毛领外套、戴着白色口罩的警察队伍快速地在街上走着，将越来越少的参与者隔开，三五一群地驱赶到人行道上。在一群人中，有名女性呼吁大家一起离开，这样就不会有人被单独带走。
"The streets emptied, and what was left was, again, uncertainty about what, if anything, would come next. On Monday, the streets were quiet, as lockdowns and Covid closures continued, though police officers guarded some subway stops and intersections. Online, some discussed plans for another gathering that night, proposing potential demands for attendees to coalesce around, such as a government apology to Urumqi.",街上不再有人，只剩下对接下来会发生什么(如果发生的话)的又一个不确定。周一的街上很安静，封控和新冠清零仍在继续，虽然多了守卫在一些地铁站和十字路口的警察。网上有人讨论了周一晚间举行另一场集会的计划，提出了一些参与者都能支持的潜在诉求，例如政府向乌鲁木齐道歉。
"But others worried that police officers had already infiltrated the group; some said that they had received phone calls from the local police asking where they had been the night before. By early evening, police cars lined the area where people had chosen to gather that evening. Attendees were sparse.",但也有人担心警察已渗透到这个活动中来;有人说，他们已接到当地警方打来的电话，询问他们头天晚上去了哪里。傍晚时分，人们为当晚选择的聚集地点周围全是警车。参加者寥寥无几。
The fire began with a faulty power strip in a bedroom on the 15th floor of an apartment building in China's far west. Firefighters spent three hours putting it out too slow to prevent at least 10 deaths and what might have remained an isolated accident turned into a tragedy and a political headache for local leaders.,在中国偏远西部地区的一栋公寓，15楼一个卧室的插线板发生故障，引发火灾。消防员花了三个小时才将其扑灭——由于救火速度太慢，导致至少10人死亡——一场偶然事故变成了一场悲剧，并成为令当地领导头疼的政治问题。
"Many people suspected that a Covid lockdown had hampered rescue efforts or trapped victims inside their homes, and though officials denied that had happened, angry comments flooded social media and residents took to the streets in the city where the fire erupted.",许多人怀疑，是疫情封锁阻碍了救援工作或导致受害者困在家中无法逃生，尽管官员予以否认，但社交媒体上充满愤怒的评论，在火灾发生的城市，民众走上了街头。
"Now the episode in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region, has unleashed the most defiant eruption of public anger against the ruling Communist Party in years. In cities across China this weekend, thousands gathered with candles and flowers to mourn the fire's victims. On campuses, students staged vigils, many holding up pieces of blank white paper in mute protest.",这起发生在新疆地区首府乌鲁木齐的事件引发了公众对执政的共产党的愤怒，这是多年来最具挑衅性的一次爆发。本周末，在中国各地的城市，数千人举着蜡烛和鲜花聚集在一起，哀悼火灾中的遇难者。在校园里，学生们举行了守夜活动，许多人举着白纸以示无声的抗议。
"In Shanghai, some residents even called for the Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping, to step down, a rare and bold challenge.",在上海，一些民众甚至呼吁共产党及其领导人习近平下台，这是一次罕见而大胆的挑战。
"The outpouring has created new pressures on Mr. Xi only a month after he secured a third term as party head, sealing his status as China's most dominant leader in decades. The broader source of ire is his ""zero Covid"" strategy, which seeks to eliminate infections with lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing.","这给习近平带来了新的压力，仅一个月前，他刚获得了第三个党主席任期，巩固了他作为中国几十年来最强大领导人的地位。人们更广泛的愤怒是针对他的""清零""政策，也就是通过封锁、隔离和大规模检测来消除感染的防疫策略。"
"It has kept deaths from the coronavirus much lower than elsewhere but also brought many Chinese cities to a near standstill, disrupted life and travel for hundreds of millions and forced many small businesses to close.",它使新冠病毒的死亡人数远低于其他地方，但也使许多中国城市几乎陷入停滞，数亿人的生活和出行遭到扰乱，许多小企业被迫关门。
"Protests are relatively rare in China. Especially under Mr. Xi, the party has eliminated most means for organizing people to take on the government. Dissidents have been imprisoned, social media is heavily censored, and independent groups involved in human rights have been banned. The protests that break out in towns and villages often involve workers, farmers or other locals aggrieved by job losses, land disputes, pollution or other issues that usually remain contained.",抗议活动在中国相对罕见。尤其是在习近平的领导下，中共已经根除了民众组织起来对抗政府的大部分手段。持不同政见者遭到监禁，社交媒体受到严格审查，参与倡导人权的独立团体被取缔。在城镇和乡村爆发的抗议活动通常涉及的是工人、农民或其他的地方民众，他们因失业、土地纠纷、污染或其他往往受到压制的问题而感到不满。
"But the pervasiveness of China's Covid restrictions has created a focus for anger that transcends class and geography. Migrant workers struggling with food shortages and joblessness during weekslong lockdowns, university students held on campuses, urban professionals chafing at travel restrictions the roots of their frustrations are the same.",但是，中国无处不在的防疫限制措施已经造成了超越阶级和地域的愤怒焦点。在长达数周的封锁期间，农民工在食品短缺和失业问题上苦苦挣扎，大学生被关在校园里，城市里的上班族因出行限制而恼怒——他们不满的根源是一样的。
"The Communist Party's greatest fear would be realized if these similar grievances led protesters from disparate backgrounds to cooperate, in an echo of 1989, when students, workers, small traders and residents found some common cause in the protests demanding democratic change that took over Tiananmen Square. So far, that has not occurred.",如果相似的不满导致不同背景的抗议者合作，共产党最害怕的事情就会成真，就像1989年那样。当年，人们要求民主变革，抗议者占领了天安门广场，学生、工人、小商贩和居民在抗议活动中找到了一些共同的目标。之后，这样的情况尚未再发生过。
"""Covid Zero produced an unintended consequence, which is putting a huge number of people in the same situation,"" said Yasheng Huang, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management who leads its China Lab. ""This is a game changer.""","""清零政策产生了出人意料的后果，让很多人处于同样的境地，""麻省理工学院斯隆管理学院教授、""中国实验室""项目的负责人黄亚生说。""这个情况改变了游戏规则。"""
"""The anger has been pent up for a while, but I think the 20th Congress provided an expectation that it would wind down,"" he said, referring to the party's leadership reshuffle in October. ""When that did not happen, the frustration quickly boiled over.""","""愤怒已经被压抑了一段时间，但我认为二十大提供了一种预期，即防控措施会逐渐放松，""他说，指的是10月份中共领导层的重新洗牌。""当防控措施没有放松时，不满迅速爆发。"""
"By Monday morning in Beijing, China's leaders, including Mr. Xi, had yet to comment on the weekend tumult, and party-run news media were also silent.",周一上午在北京，包括习近平在内的中国领导人尚未对周末的骚乱发表评论，官方新闻媒体也保持沉默。
"Covid travel limitations and government restrictions on foreign journalists make reporting on the protests difficult. The Times, which has two journalists based in mainland China, has followed the protests online and reported on the demonstrations through phone interviews, verified videos and sources inside China who have shared their recordings of the events.",新冠旅行限制和政府对外国记者的限制使得对抗议活动的报道变得困难重重。时报在中国大陆有两名记者，他们一直通过网络关注抗议活动，并通过电话采访、经过核实的视频，以及中国境内分享事件记录的消息来源，对示威活动进行报道。
"The deaths from Thursday's fire in Urumqi and questions about whether the victims were sealed in their burning building resonated widely in China. After nearly three years of pandemic restrictions, many Chinese have stories of being quarantined at home, occasionally with their doors wired or welded shut or emergency exits blockaded. That shared experience seemed to feed collective suspicion and anger about the deaths.",周四乌鲁木齐大火造成的死亡，以及遇难者是否被封闭在着火大楼里的问题在中国引发了广泛共鸣。在经历了近三年的疫情限制后，许多人都有在家中隔离的经历，有时他们的门被铁链锁死或焊死，紧急出口被堵上。这种共同的经历似乎助长了人们对死亡事件的集体怀疑和愤怒。
"""Yesterday, I saw about the fire tragedy in Urumqi and was crying all the time, and then I thought of the time when Shanghai was under lockdown this year,"" said Kira Yao, a sales manager in Shanghai, who said she attended the candlelight vigil there for victims of the Urumqi fire.","""昨天，我看到乌鲁木齐的火灾悲剧，一直在哭，然后我想起了今年上海封城的时候，""上海的一名销售经理基拉·姚(音)说道，她参加了为乌鲁木齐火灾遇难者举行的烛光守夜活动。"
"""Later we shouted, 'No nucleic acid tests, we want freedom' and 'No to health codes,'"" she said. ""I felt like finally I could say what I've wanted to say.""","""后来我们高喊'不要核酸要自由'、'不要健康宝'，我和我的朋友们都哭了，我觉得，我终于可以说出我想说的话了。"""
"While many protesters limited their appeals to the loosening of Covid restrictions, some seized the chance to make broader political demands, linking the draconian reach of ""zero Covid"" to the country's authoritarian system.","虽然许多抗议者的诉求仅限于放松新冠限制，但一些人抓住机会提出了更广泛的政治要求，将""清零""的严厉影响与中国的威权制度联系起来。"
"On Sunday, hundreds of students gathered on the campus of Tsinghua University, in northwest Beijing, where they have been largely prohibited from leaving for weeks because of Covid restrictions.",周日，数百名学生聚集在北京西北部的清华大学校园，由于疫情限制，他们已被禁止离开该校数周。
"""Democracy and rule of law,"" the crowd chanted. ""Freedom of expression.""","""民主法治，""人群高呼。""表达自由。"""
"Near Liangma River in Beijing on Sunday night, at least 100 people gathered to light candles and hold up sheets of white paper, an implicit protest of censorship. The crowd shouted encouragement to the protesters in Shanghai. Others stood on a bridge, also holding up white sheets of paper, while passing drivers honked their horns.",周日晚上，在北京亮马河附近，至少100人聚集在一起，点起蜡烛，举着白纸，含蓄地抗议审查制度。人群喊话鼓励上海的抗议者。还有一些人站在桥上，也举着白纸，路过的司机按着喇叭。
"""We don't want lies; we want respect!"" a woman yelled. ""We don't want a leader; we want a voting ballot,"" she said in a reference to Mr. Xi.","""不要谎言，要尊重!""一个女人喊道。""不要领袖，要投票，""她指的是习近平。"
"In Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the pandemic originated in late 2019, hundreds walked along the streets, some pulling down barriers that had been put up to enforce neighborhood lockdowns.",在2019年底新冠疫情发源地武汉，数百人走上街头，一些人推倒了为实施社区封锁而设置的障碍。
"The protests followed hopes that Covid restrictions would gradually ease after officials in Beijing released a 20-point plan this month to limit the scope of pandemic measures. Based on that plan, people had expected local governments to scale back contact tracing and mass quarantines, but when Covid cases surged, officials revived the same sweeping tactics.","此前，北京官员于本月发布了一个""二十条""方案，对疫情措施的范围实施限制，人们曾希望防疫措施将逐渐放松。基于这个方案，人们曾预计地方政府将缩减密接者追踪和大规模隔离，但当新冠病例激增时，官员们又恢复了过去的一刀切策略。"
"Mr. Xi has no easy response to the widespread anger. Censors have moved quickly to scrub photos and video footage of the protests. If Mr. Xi cracks down on demonstrators, he could anger the public further, straining even China's formidable security apparatus. If he abruptly lifts many restrictions, he risks hurting his image of unassailable authority that he has built in part on his success battling Covid. The ensuing rise in infections, potentially deadly among the vulnerable, may also become another source of discontent.",习近平没有简单的回应方式可用来平息愤怒。审查人员迅速采取行动，删除了有关抗议活动的照片和视频。如果习近平对示威者进行镇压，可能会进一步激怒公众，甚至使中国强大的安全机构感到紧张。如果他突然取消许多限制，就可能损害他在一定程度上因成功抗击新冠疫情而建立起来的不可动摇的权威形象。随之而来的感染人数上升对于弱势群体可能是致命的，这也可能成为不满的另一个来源。
"""The immediate challenge is whether and how they're going to continue with 'zero Covid' when there is so much frustration. This is a decision he has to make in the next, say, 48 to 72 hours,"" Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College who studies Chinese politics, said in an interview. ""You can arrest people and put them in jail, but the virus will still be there. There are simply no easy answers for him, only hard choices.""","""当前的挑战是，在有这么多挫折的情况下，他们是否，以及如何继续'清零'政策。这是他必须在接下来的48到72小时内做出的决定，""克莱蒙特·麦肯纳学院研究中国政治的政治学教授裴敏欣在接受采访时说。""你可以把人逮捕起来，把他们关进监狱，但病毒仍然在那里。对他来说，没有简单的答案，只有艰难的选择。"""
"The political stakes were made stark in Shanghai on Saturday evening, when what started out as a vigil escalated into a street protest.",周六晚上，上海的一场守夜活动升级为街头抗议，政治赌注的大小暴露无遗。
"Dozens of people had gathered on Urumqi Road, named after the city in Xinjiang, to grieve the victims of the fire. As the crowd grew into the hundreds, chants broke out, with people calling for an easing of the Covid controls. ""We want freedom,"" they said. A small number of them openly denounced Mr. Xi and the Communist Party.","数十人聚集在以新疆城市乌鲁木齐命名的道路上悼念火灾遇难者。随着人群增加到数百人，抗议者高呼口号，呼吁放松新冠控制。""不要核酸要自由，""他们大声说道。其中有一小部分人公开谴责习近平和共产党。"
"""Xi Jinping!"" a man in the crowd repeatedly shouted. ""Step down!"" some chanted in response.","""习近平!""人群中的一名男子反复喊道。""下台!""一些人这样回应。"
"""This is unheard of in this era,"" Professor Pei said. ""It reflects a great deal of frustration with the Covid policies. People are just tired.""","""这在这个时代是闻所未闻的，""裴教授说。""这反映了人们对新冠疫情政策的极大失望。人们是真的累了。"""
"For most of the time since Covid spread from Wuhan nearly three years ago, many Chinese have accepted tough controls, including sweeping restrictions limiting travel to the country, as a price for avoiding the widespread illness and death that the United States and other countries suffered. But public patience has eroded this year as other nations increasingly have adapted to living with the virus.",自近三年前新冠病毒从武汉传播开来的大部分时间里，许多中国人都接受了严厉的防控措施，包括不得入境在内的各种全面限制，以此作为避免美国和其他国家经历的那种大范围感染和死亡的代价。但随着其他国家越来越适应与病毒共存，公众的耐心在今年逐渐减弱。
"Workers at a vast iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, clashed violently with the police last week over lockdown measures and delays in the payment of bonuses. Earlier this month, hundreds of migrants locked down in the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou tore down barricades and ransacked food provisions. In October, a lone protester draped banners on a bridge in Beijing, just days ahead of the Communist Party congress where Mr. Xi won his new term in power.",上周，河南郑州一家大型iPhone工厂的工人因为封锁措施和奖金发放的延迟，与警方发生暴力冲突。本月早些时候，数百名被困在制造业中心广州的外来务工人员拆除路障，洗劫食品供应。10月，就在习近平赢得新任期的共产党大会召开前几天，一名独自行动的抗议者在北京的一座立交桥上拉起横幅。
"The Chinese government is likely to worry that images and video of the protests in Shanghai will spread, despite online censorship, inspiring more unrest. A BBC reporter, Ed Lawrence, was arrested by the police during the protests. In a statement, the BBC said later, ""During his arrest, he was beaten and kicked by the police"" before being released. It was not clear if he was charged. The British broadcaster said officials explained he had been arrested ""for his own good in case he caught Covid from the crowd.""","中国政府可能担心，虽然有网络审查，但上海抗议活动的图像和视频传播开来的话，会引发更多的骚乱。BBC记者埃德·劳伦斯在抗议期间被警方逮捕。BBC后来在一份声明中表示，该记者在获释前""在被捕期间遭到警察拳打脚踢""。目前还不清楚他是否被起诉。这家英国广播公司称，官员们解释说，逮捕他是""为他好，以防他在人群里感染新冠病毒""。"
"""We do not consider this a credible explanation,"" the BBC said.","""我们认为这不是一个可信的解释，""BBC表示。"
"Crowds also congregated in Chengdu, a city in southwest China, video from Sunday showed, with some shouting, ""We want freedom, we want democracy."" Others yelled, ""Freedom of speech, freedom of the press!""","周日的视频显示，中国西南部城市成都也有人群聚集，一些人高呼，""要自由，要民主。""还有人高呼:""要人民开口说话!不要404!"""
"May Hu, who lives in southern Hunan Province, said she spent hours watching a livestream of the Shanghai protests on Instagram, which is blocked in China unless using software to surmount censorship barriers.",住在湖南省南部的梅·胡(音)说，她花了几个小时在Instagram上观看上海抗议活动的直播。Instagram在中国遭到屏蔽，除非使用软件翻墙。
"""Before, everyone only thought about how to escape this all,"" said Ms. Hu, who is in her 20s. ""After, many people's thinking has changed to, 'We need to go fight and win freedom.'""","""最大的区别是，所有人想的都是逃离这一切，""20多岁的胡女士说。""之后很多人的想法转变成了'我们要去抗争，我们要赢得自由'。"""
"Some participants in the previous night's gathering in Shanghai expressed fear that the widespread public fury could ultimately draw an equally furious official response. A recent college graduate who requested that only his surname, Li, be used, said that after seeing the police pushing and detaining people on Saturday night, he was nervous about joining another demonstration.",一些参加前一晚上海集会的人表示，他们担心公众的普遍愤怒最终可能招致官方同样愤怒的回应。一位要求只透露自己姓李的应届大学毕业生说，在周六晚上看到警察推搡和拘捕人们之后，他对参加另一场示威感到紧张。
"""After speaking out, some spectators maybe will feel empowered that you can't mess around with the people but what will the outcome be?"" said Ding Tingting, an art curator who joined the mourning vigil in Shanghai but disapproved of the rowdy chants later that night.","""发声后，或许观众会觉得感受到了一种力量，人民不好惹，不过会有什么结果呢?""艺术策展人丁婷婷(音)说。她参加了在上海举行的悼念守夜活动，但不赞成当晚晚些时候的喧闹呼喊。"
"On Sunday evening, residents gathered in the same area, some shouting, ""Release them,"" apparently after the police seized people in sometimes rough encounters, video shared with The Times showed. Officers hurried others along, preventing them settling in place for any potential protest.","时报获得的视频显示，周日晚上，居民们聚集在同一地区，一些人高喊""放人""，这显然是在警方在有时动用粗暴手段逮捕了一些人后发生的。警察催着其他人往前走，防止他们停下来举行抗议活动。"
"More than a year after one of China's biggest real estate developers began to collapse, trouble has rippled through cities across the country. Dozens of other developers have also missed debt payments, the sale of new homes has plunged and construction cranes have come to a standstill at many sites.",自一年多前中国最大的开发商之一崩溃之始，麻烦已波及到全国各城市。又有数十家开发商也未能偿还债务，新房销售大幅下滑，许多建筑工地的起重机停了下来。
"This week the Chinese government, which until now has stayed largely on the sidelines of the country's housing crash, has taken its most forceful steps so far to try to minimize the damage from the turmoil that has enveloped China Evergrande Group, the world's most heavily indebted developer, and many of its competitors.",中国恒大集团是世界上负债最重的房地产开发商。为了减少席卷该集团以及它许多竞争对手的危机所造成的损失，本周，中国政府采取了最强有力的措施，此前中国政府一直在很大程度上对该国的房地产市场危机保持观望。
"Real estate development plays an outsize role in China's economy, representing about a quarter of economic output and a quarter of its bank loans. Housing represents at least three-fifths of household assets in China, and many Chinese regard apartments as the only reliable way to build wealth.",房地产开发在中国经济中发挥着巨大作用，约占经济产出的四分之一和银行贷款的四分之一。在中国，住房至少占家庭资产的五分之三，许多中国人将住房视为积累财富的唯一可靠途径。
"This week's intervention by the government took on greater urgency as Covid-19 cases hit record levels. The infections have prompted a new wave of strict lockdowns that are disrupting factories and other businesses, cutting into spending by consumers, and preventing home buyers from visiting apartment complex showrooms. This has further strained an economy already under severe pressure.",随着新冠病例数创下历史新高，本周政府的干预变得更加紧迫。这些感染病例引发了新一波的严格封锁，扰乱了工厂和其他企业，削减了消费者的支出，购房者无法参观公寓楼的样板房。这使本已承受巨大压力的经济更加难以承受。
"China's cabinet called late Wednesday for banks, most of which are state-owned, to lend more money for the completion of unfinished apartments, following a similar directive by regulators put out hours earlier. China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, and the main bank regulator codified 16 measures on the same day to make sure that developers can borrow enough money from banks and bond investors, and can defer repayment when necessary. And on Friday evening, the central bank reduced by $70 billion the money that the country's commercial banks are together required to hold for emergencies, freeing them to lend that money instead.",中国国务院周三晚间呼吁银行——其中大部分是国有银行——为未完工公寓的竣工提供更多资金，监管机构在数小时前发布了类似指令。中国央行中国人民银行和主要银行监管机构在同一天制定了16项措施，以确保开发商能够从银行和债券投资者那里借到足够的钱，并在必要时可以推迟还款。周五晚上，中央银行释放了5000亿人民币的长期资金，这些资金来自该国商业银行本被要求持有的准备金，在释放后可以被用于放贷。
"An affiliate of the central bank agreed earlier this month to guarantee the repayment of new bonds issued by some of the less distressed real estate developers, in effect assuring investors it was safe to lend to the companies.",本月早些时候，中央银行的一家附属机构同意为一些陷入困境的房地产开发商发行的新债券提供偿还担保，这实际上是在向投资者保证，借钱给这些公司是安全的。
The finance ministry has enacted a tax break for people who buy a new home within a year of selling the previous one.,财政部已经为在出售旧房后一年内购买新房的人制定了税收减免政策。
"Acting on instructions from the cabinet and bank regulators, China's biggest banks gave lines of credit this week to large developers. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China announced on Thursday that it had issued lines of credit totaling $91 billion to 12 developers. Bank of Communications gave a $14 billion line of credit to Vanke, China's biggest developer.",根据国务院和银行监管机构的指示，中国最大的银行本周向大型开发商提供了信贷额度。中国工商银行周四宣布，已向12家开发商发放总计6500亿人民币的信贷额度。交通银行向中国最大的开发商万科提供了1000亿人民币的信贷额度。
"Yi Gang, the governor of the central bank, declared that the government was willing to use its policy tools to stabilize the country's huge real estate sector.",央行行长易纲宣布，政府愿意使用其政策工具来稳定庞大的房地产行业。
"""China's housing sector is linked to a lot of upstream and downstream industries, so its healthy development is of great significance to the overall economy,"" Mr. Yi said in a speech on Monday.","易纲在周一的讲话中表示:""房地产业关联很多上下游行业，其良性循环对经济健康发展具有重要意义。"""
"Financial regulators in China are under pressure to rebuild public confidence in the real estate sector. Domestic and international investors have been selling bonds and other assets and moving money out of the country as worries persist about the economy, which is expected to grow at barely half of Beijing's target of 5.5 percent this year. Speculation is rising that Xi Jinping, China's leader, may raise taxes on the affluent to pay for more social spending.",中国的金融监管机构面临重建公众对房地产行业信心的压力。预计中国今年的经济增长率仅为北京5.5%目标的一半，由于对经济的担忧持续存在，国内和国际投资者一直在出售债券和其他资产并将资金从中国转移出去。越来越多的人猜测，中国领导人习近平可能会提高富人的税收，以支付更多的社会支出。
"Bond prices have fallen this autumn in Shanghai trading, driving up yields and making it more expensive for developers to borrow without government help. Lightly regulated wealth management funds, many of which use borrowed money to place big bets in bond markets, have seen investors withdraw large sums another sign of the broad financial duress also affecting housing.",今年秋天，上海交易的债券价格下跌，推高了收益率，导致开发商在没有政府帮助的情况下面临更高的借贷成本。财富管理基金监管宽松，其中许多使用借来的资金在债券市场下大赌注，投资者已撤出大笔资金——再次表明广泛的金融压力也影响到房地产。
"Just as China's health policy has become stuck in an inflexible ""zero Covid"" stance of lockdowns and mass testing, China's housing policy is also deadlocked. Strong positions taken by Mr. Xi have complicated the resolution of the housing crisis and the Covid policy.",正如中国的卫生政策固着在以封锁和大规模检测为主的僵硬清零态度上，中国的住房政策也陷入僵局。习近平采取的强硬立场使住房危机的解决和新冠政策复杂化。
"With exports falling right now and consumer spending weak during widespread Covid lockdowns, the economy is even more dependent on housing.",由于目前出口下降，在范围广泛的新冠封锁期间，消费者支出疲软，经济更加依赖住房。
"""To save the property market is to save the economy,"" said Han Xiuyun, an associate professor of economics at Tsinghua University, in an online analysis.","""救楼市就是救经济，""清华大学经济学副教授韩秀云在网上分析中说。"
"In housing, the crucial issue lies in whether the government should once again tolerate people using housing investments as a way to make money, rather than simply as a place to live. Mr. Xi had proclaimed in 2016 that ""housing is for shelter, not speculation,"" an idea that became government policy two years ago. The country's housing ministry imposed a ""three red lines"" policy that put guardrails around how much developers could borrow.","在住房方面，关键问题在于政府是否应该再次允许人们将住房投资作为一种赚钱的方式，而不仅仅是作为一个住所。习近平在2016年宣布:""房子是用来住的，不是用来炒的。""这一理念在两年前成为政府政策。该国住建部实施了""三条红线""政策，对开发商可以借到多少资金设置了限制。"
"The goal was to prevent developers from borrowing excessively and plowing the money into speculative projects, while also constraining banks from lending too much. Crossing even one red line put pressure on developers to start paying back debt, and that quickly strained their finances.",这样做的目标是防止开发商过度借贷并将资金投入投机项目，同时也限制银行过度放贷。哪怕仅触碰一条红线都会给开发商带来开始偿还债务的压力，令他们迅速陷入财务紧张。
"The housing ministry has left the three red lines policy in place even as at least three dozen real estate developers have missed payments on one or more bonds, mainly overseas bonds.",尽管至少有30多家房地产开发商拖欠了一项或多项债券的还款，主要是海外债券，但住建部仍保留三条红线政策。
"China's housing market was already inflated and might have crashed even without the tougher policy, some analysts believe, after home prices soared over the past quarter century.",一些分析人士认为，房价在过去25年中飙升，中国的房地产市场已经膨胀，即使没有更严厉的政策可能也已经崩溃。
"Oxford Economics calculated this week that prices for newly built homes across China reached 8.5 times average household disposable income last year. In the United States, that ratio peaked at 5.8 times in 2007, before the American housing bubble burst.",根据牛津经济研究院本周的计算，去年中国新建住宅的价格达到平均家庭可支配收入的8.5倍。在美国房地产泡沫破灭之前，美国的这一比率在2007年达到了5.8的峰值。
"Some economists say that Mr. Xi was right to address speculation, but that the policy response needs to be more carefully crafted.",一些经济学家表示，习近平打击投机行为是正确的，但需要更谨慎地制定应对政策。
"""Even though the direction of the policy of 'housing is for living not speculation' is correct, the implementation of the policy may require fine tuning in light of market conditions,"" Zhu Ning, the deputy dean of the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, said.","""尽管'房住不炒'的政策方向是正确的，但政策的实施可能需要根据市场情况进行微调，""上海高级金融学院副院长朱宁说。"
This week's burst of regulatory activity could mark the start of that fine tuning.,本周监管活动的爆发可能标志着微调的开始。
An affiliate of the central bank has begun providing guarantees for $35 billion worth of bonds to be issued by the country's real estate developers. Government guarantees will allow the developers to sell new bonds at low interest rates to the state-controlled banks.,中央银行的一家附属机构已开始为该国房地产开发商发行的价值2500亿人民币的债券提供担保。政府担保将允许开发商以低利率向国有银行出售新债券。
The proceeds of the new bonds will then be used to repay or buy back existing bonds. The aim is to relieve steep interest costs facing developers.,新债券的收益将用于偿还或回购现有债券。这样做的目的是减轻开发商面临的高额利息成本。
"Under another of the measures released this week, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has separately told banks that they can delay collecting interest and principal payments from real estate developers for a year. That deferral allows China's commercial banking system to avoid recording a big wave of troubled loans, which would otherwise depress profits.",根据本周发布的另一项措施，中国银行保险监督管理委员会已逐一告知银行，它们可以延迟一年向房地产开发商收取利息和本金。这种延期让中国的商业银行系统避免出现一大波会压低利润的问题贷款。
"The housing ministry has begun allowing local governments to dismantle their extensive limits on who can buy apartments. Many cities had discouraged out-of-town investors from buying homes until now, so as to make apartments less expensive for longtime residents.",住建部已开始允许地方政府取消对购房人资格的广泛限制。直到现在，许多城市一直不鼓励外地投资者购房，以便为长期居民提供更便宜的住房。
"Finally, China's Ministry of Finance has approved a temporary tax break designed to make sure that investors keep their money in the property market. The rule says that the 20 percent tax on gains from selling real estate can be avoided if the proceeds from the sale are invested into another real estate acquisition within 12 months.",最后，中国财政部批准了一项临时减税措施，旨在确保投资者将资金留在房地产市场。该规则规定，如果售房所得在12个月内投资于另一项房产，则可以退回因售房被征收的20%税款。
"The tax break, which resembles the so-called Section 1031 tax provision for real estate investors in the United States, expires at the end of next year. The goal is to encourage people sitting on large gains in the value of their homes to trade up to newer and larger apartments. That might help revive at least part of China's huge construction industry.",这一税收减免将于明年年底到期，类似于美国针对房地产投资者的所谓的第1031条税收规定。其目标是鼓励那些坐享其房屋价值大幅上涨的人们购买更新更大的公寓。这可能有助于至少部分重振中国庞大的建筑业。
"The longer-term problem is that the vast movement of rural residents to cities that began in the 1980s has slowed as villages have been drained of people, while the country's birthrate has plunged. Oxford Economics estimated this week that housing demand was 8 million units per year from 2010 through 2019, but would drop to only 4.6 million per year from next year through 2030.",更长期的问题是，随着农村人口流失，从1980年代开始的农村居民向城市大量涌入的人口流动变缓，同时出生率大幅下降。牛津经济研究院本周估计，从2010年到2019年，住房需求为每年800万套，但从明年到2030年将降至每年460万套。
"The dilemma for Beijing lies in how to manage the decline of the construction industry and many associated industries, from steel and cement to furniture and washing machines.",北京的困境在于如何应对建筑业以及从钢铁和水泥到家具和洗衣机等许多相关行业的衰退。
"The construction sector ""has to shrink,"" George Magnus, an associate at the China Center at Oxford University, said. ""The question is how, and at what cost.""","建筑业""必须收缩""，牛津大学中国中心的助理乔治·马格纳斯说。""问题是如何收缩以及付出什么代价。"""
"Protests spread to cities and college campuses around China on Saturday night, reflecting rising public anger at the country's draconian Covid controls, with some in a crowd in Shanghai directing their fury at the Communist Party and its top leader, Xi Jinping.",抗议活动已在周六晚间蔓延到中国各地的城市和大学校园，反映出公众对严厉的新冠病毒防控措施的愤怒情绪不断增长。上海的抗议人群中，有些人将怒火指向了中共及其最高领导人习近平。
"The wider demonstrations followed an outpouring of online anger and a street protest that erupted Friday in Urumqi, the regional capital of Xinjiang in western China, where at least 10 people died and nine others were injured in an apartment fire on Thursday. Many Chinese people say they suspect Covid restrictions prevented those victims from escaping their homes, a claim the government has rejected.",更大范围的示威发生前，在上周五，网络上的愤怒情绪已经爆发，中国西部新疆自治区首府乌鲁木齐市还出现了街头抗议，肇因是乌鲁木齐一天前发生的公寓大火，导致至少十人丧生，还有九人受伤。许多中国人说，他们怀疑是新冠病毒防疫措施导致这些受害者无法从家中逃出，但政府否认了这个说法。
"The tragedy has fanned broader calls to ease China's harsh regimen of Covid tests, urban lockdowns and limits on movement nearly three years into the pandemic. For much of that time, many accepted such controls as a price for avoiding the widespread illness and deaths that the United States, India and other countries endured. But public patience has eroded this year as other nations, bolstered by vaccines, moved back to something like normal, even as infections continued. And after years of enforcing the strict ""zero Covid"" rules, many local officials appear worn down.","这场悲剧引发了要求放松防控措施的更广泛呼声，在新冠病毒大流行近三年的时间里，中国一直实行着严厉的核酸检测、城市封锁和限制行动措施。在疫情的大部分时间里，许多中国人接受了这些控制，认为那是避免发生美国、印度和其他国家遭受的那种大规模感染和死亡的代价。但公众的耐心今年已逐渐消失，因为其他国家在接种了疫苗后基本上恢复了正常生活，即使感染仍在继续。而且在执行了多年""新冠清零""政策后，许多地方官员们似乎已经精疲力尽。"
The widening discontent may test Mr. Xi's efforts to hold those rules in place.,不断增长的不满情绪可能会考验习近平坚持清零的努力。
"""The demonstrations across the country have been like the spark that lit a prairie fire,"" James Yu, a resident of Shanghai, said in an interview, adopting a Chinese phrase used to describe the spread of Mao Zedong's Communist revolution. ""I feel like everyone can make their voice loud and clear. It feels powerful.""","""最近两天全国的游行就像星星之火可以燎原一样，""上海居民詹姆斯·余(音)在接受采访时说。""我感觉大家的声音可以响亮地发出来，我觉得很有力。"""
"The biggest protest on Saturday appeared to be in Shanghai, where hundreds of people, mostly in their twenties, gathered at an intersection of Urumqi Road, named after the city in Xinjiang, to grieve the dead with candles and signs. Many there and elsewhere held sheets of blank white paper over their heads or faces in mournful defiance; white is a funeral color in China.",周六最大的抗议活动似乎发生在上海，数百人聚集在以新疆首府命名的乌鲁木齐中路的一个十字路口，用蜡烛和标语哀悼死者。上海和其他地方的许多人将无字白纸悲哀地举过头顶或举到面前，以示抗议。白色在中国是丧葬的颜色。
"The numbers grew, while lines of police officers looked on, and chants broke out, with people calling for an easing of the Covid controls, video footage showed. Some used obscene language to denounce the demand that residents check in with a Covid phone app in public places such as shops and parks. Their shouts took on a boldly political edge.",视频片段显示，随着抗议人群增多，成排的警察在一旁静观。人们高呼口号，要求放松新冠防控措施。有些人破口大骂，谴责要求居民在进入商店和公园等公共场所时扫手机健康码的做法。他们的呼声带有大胆的政治色彩。
"""We want freedom,"" protesters chanted.","""不要核酸要自由，""抗议者高呼。"
"Some also directed their anger at Mr. Xi, a rare act of political defiance likely to alarm Communist Party officials and to prompt tighter censorship and policing.",还有人把怒火指向了习近平，这是一种罕见的政治反抗行为，可能会惊动中共官员，导致他们加强审查和警力。
"""Xi Jinping!"" a man in the crowd repeatedly shouted.","人群中有一名男子不断高喊:""习近平!"""
"""Step down!"" some chanted in response. Many protesters used their phones to record the collective mourning and protests, images that may spread despite censorship, emboldening others to speak out.","每喊一声，就会有人高声回应:""下台!""许多抗议者用手机记录了这些集体哀悼和抗议活动，尽管有政府的审查，这些图像也许会传播开来，激励其他人公开发声。"
"The protest dispersed after more police officers moved in, dividing the crowd, and officers dragged some people away, according to Eva Rammeloo, a Dutch journalist who was there posting updates on Twitter.",据现场通过Twitter发布最新消息的荷兰记者任美珞(Eva Rammeloo)称，更多警察到来后将抗议人群分开，人们开始离开，警察还拖走了一些人。
"Last month, Mr. Xi won a groundbreaking third term as the Communist Party's general secretary, entrenching his status as China's most powerful leader in decades. He also packed a new national leadership lineup with loyalist officials, making his hold seem assured.",上个月，习近平破天荒地获得了中共中央总书记的第三个任期，牢固确立了他作为中国几十年来权力最大的领导人的地位。他还在新的国家领导人班子里安排自己的亲信，让他的控制看起来得以保证。
"But the night of public anger signals how his stringent Covid policies, initially heralded as a success for China after the pandemic spread globally from there in early 2020, are becoming a liability.",但周六晚间的公众愤怒表明，习近平的新冠清零政策正在让他骑虎难下。自从新冠病毒在2020年初从中国蔓延到全球各地后，严厉的清零政策曾被其视为成功的做法。
"They have hurt restaurants, shops and other small businesses, worsening China's economic slowdown. This month, thousands of factory workers angry over bungled lockdown measures and delays in payment of a promised bonus clashed with riot police and tore down barricades at a huge plant in central China that makes iPhones.",严厉的清零政策已伤害了餐馆、商店和其他小企业，加剧了中国经济的放缓。本月，在中国中部一家生产iPhone的大型工厂，数千名工厂对失败的封控措施和厂方未能按时支付承诺的奖金愤怒不已，与防暴警察发生了冲突，并拆除了路障。
"Officials continue to fear that unchecked spread of Covid, even in its less virulent forms, could lead to mass deaths. China's domestically developed Covid vaccine is generally less effective than some developed abroad, but Beijing has not approved the foreign mRNA vaccines for domestic use. Many older Chinese people have resisted vaccination or booster shots, sometimes because they are wary of side effects, believe unfounded rumors about the risks, or feel they are safe from exposure to the virus.",官员们还是担心，新冠病毒(即使是毒性较弱的变异株)不受控制地传播，仍可能导致大规模死亡。中国国产的新冠疫苗普遍不如国外研发的疫苗有效，但中国政府尚未批准在国内使用国外的mRNA疫苗。许多中国老年人拒绝接种疫苗或打疫苗加强针，有的人是因为相信了有关风险的毫无根据的谣言，担心副作用，也有些人觉得自己不会接触到病毒。
"On Sunday, the People's Daily the Chinese Communist Party's main newspaper called for sticking with Mr. Xi's policies.",周日，中共的主要报纸《人民日报》呼吁坚持习近平的清零政策。
"Measured in Covid deaths and hospitalizations, ""Chinese people have had the least impact from the pandemic,"" the front-page editorial said. Officials and the public, it said, must ""firmly overcome slackening and war weariness.""","该报发表在头版的社评称，""我国新冠肺炎死亡病例数、住院病例数远低于全球平均值，无论是发病率还是死亡率，中国人受疫情的影响都是最小的。""社评还说，官员和公众必须""坚决克服麻痹思想、厌战情绪、侥幸心理、松劲心态""。"
"This month, the government issued measures to ease the restrictions that have hampered travel and business. Yet local officials remain under intense pressure to keep infections near zero, leading to confusing flip-flops in rule enforcement. The resulting uncertainty over where China's war on Covid is going and when it might end has fueled public frustration, as seen in Urumqi, Shanghai and beyond.",本月，中央政府出台了放宽防疫措施的做法，以减少对旅行和商务活动的限制。然而，地方官员们仍承受着将感染维持在接近零水平的巨大压力，导致新规在执行上的混乱。中国的新冠病毒防疫战将走向何方、什么时候会结束的不确定性加剧了公众的不满情绪，正如乌鲁木齐、上海及其他地区的抗议活动所表明的那样。
"""There is only one disease in the world, that is, being unfree and poor, and now we have both,"" a man in Chongqing, in southwest China, declared in a video that spread widely in the country in recent days despite censorship.","""这个世界只有一种病，它叫不自由和穷，我们现在全占到，""重庆市的一名男子在一段视频中宣称。尽管有政府的审查，这段视频最近几天里在国内广泛传播。"
"""Give me liberty or give me death!"" shouted the man, whose identity is unknown but who quickly acquired the nickname ""Super Brother"" online.","""不自由，毋宁死!""这名身份不详的男子喊道，他很快在网上获得了""超人哥""的绰号。"
"Protests and mourning vigils also took place on at least three university campuses, according to online videos verified by The Times.",据得到时报核实的网络视频显示，抗议和哀悼守夜活动还出现在至少三所大学的校园。
"""Before I felt I was a coward, but now at this moment I feel I can stand up,"" a young man who said he was from Xinjiang told a gathering at a campus of the Communication University of China in Nanjing, in eastern China. His comments were captured by a video that emerged online on Saturday night and whose location was verified by The Times.","""我以前觉得我自己很懦弱，直到这一刻我觉得我自己可以站出来，""一名自称来自新疆的年轻人在南京传媒学院校园里的一个集会上说。他发言的视频于周六晚间出现在网上，时报核实了该视频的拍摄地点。"
"Hundreds held up their phones like lit candles. He said, ""I speak for my home region, speak for those friends who lost relatives and kin in the fire disaster.""","数百人打开了手机的电筒功能，像举点燃的蜡烛那样将手机举起。上述视频中的男子说，""我为我的家乡发声，我为在火灾里失去亲人、失去家人朋友、逝者而发声，""他说。"
"""And,"" he added, ""for the deceased.""","""也为全国所有遇难的同胞们而发声，""他还说。"
"Smaller protests and vigils also occurred at Peking University and Wuhan University of Technology, videos, verifiable from the buildings in the background, showed.",通过背景中的建筑物可以验证拍摄地点的视频显示，北京大学和武汉理工大学校园里也发生了规模较小的抗议和守夜活动。
"A protest also broke out in another city in Xinjiang: Korla, in the region's north. Hundreds of residents assembled at the prefecture's government office, as seen in video footage that appeared online on Saturday evening.",位于新疆北部的库尔勒也爆发了抗议活动。从周六晚间出现在网上的视频片段可以看出，数百名居民聚集在州政府办公楼前。
"""Lift the lockdown,"" they shouted.","""解封，""他们喊道。"
"The Xinjiang region has been under intense security controls for years as part of the government's long clampdown on Uyghurs, a largely Muslim ethnic group. But many protesters in Korla seemed to be members of China's Han ethnic majority, to judge by their accents and appearance, as were many protesters in Urumqi, the regional capital.",由于政府长期以来打压以穆斯林为主的维吾尔族，新疆地区多年来一直处于严密的安全控制之下。但从库尔勒抗议者的口音和外表可看出，他们中的许多人看来是占中国人口绝大多数的汉族，新疆首府乌鲁木齐的许多抗议者也是汉族。
"During the night, an official came out and promised the crowd in Korla that lockdowns would be eased, prompting applause and shouts of welcome.",那天夜里，一名官员从大楼走出来，向库尔勒的抗议人群承诺将放松封锁，引发了掌声和欢迎声。
"But before the latest demonstrations, the Xinjiang government had been warning residents that strict Covid measures remained necessary, and the security authorities there and elsewhere across China are also likely now to tighten monitoring and security in an effort to prevent further unrest.",但在最近的示威之前，新疆政府曾一直警告居民，仍有必要采取严格的抗疫措施。新疆和中国其他地方的安全部门现在也很可能会加强监控和安保措施，以防止骚乱进一步扩大。
"""The pandemic risks have not been thoroughly eradicated, and the chains of transmission have not been totally broken, so the slightest relaxation may bring a rebound,"" the Xinjiang leadership announced on Saturday. Officials, it said, must ""sternly attack concocting and spreading rumors, inciting incidents, violently resisting pandemic control measures and other criminal conduct.""","""疫情风险尚未彻底清除、传播链条仍未完全阻断，稍有松懈就会造成反弹，""新疆自治区党委常委会召开会议说。会议还说，官员必须""依法依规严厉打击造谣传谣、煽动滋事、暴力抗拒疫情防控措施等违法犯罪行为""。"
"In Shanghai, many neighborhoods have begun demanding that residents do frequent, often time-consuming Covid nucleic acid tests again only days after announcing that tests would be seldom needed going forward. In that city, which endured a grueling two-month lockdown earlier this year in an effort to stamp out a Covid outbreak, the deadly fire in Urumqi appeared to reignite public anger over that episode.",上海的许多社区已开始要求居民重新进行频繁的、通常很耗时的核酸检测，就在几天前，上海曾宣布以后会基本上不再做全员核酸检测。上海曾在今年早些时候为遏制新冠病毒感染经历了两个月的艰难封控，乌鲁木齐发生的致命火灾似乎再次点燃了公众对那次封控的愤怒。
"""Yesterday, I saw about the fire tragedy in Urumqi and was crying all the time, and then I thought of the time when Shanghai was under lockdown this year,"" said Kira Yao, a sales manager in Shanghai, who said she attended a candlelight vigil for victims of the Urumqi fire.","""昨天，我看到乌鲁木齐的火灾悲剧，一直在哭，然后我想起了今年上海封城的时候，""上海的一名销售经理基拉·姚(音)说道，她参加了为乌鲁木齐火灾遇难者举行的烛光守夜活动。"
"""Later we shouted 'No nucleic acid tests, we want freedom' and 'No to health codes,' and I and my friends cried I felt like finally I could say what I've wanted to say.""","""后来我们高喊'不要核酸要自由'、'对健康码说不'，我和我的朋友们都哭了，我觉得，我终于可以说出我想说的话了。"""
"Ten people were killed and nine injured after a fire broke out in an apartment building in Xinjiang, a far western Chinese region, officials said, where Covid-19 lockdowns have confined many residents to their homes for more than three months.",中国官员表示，新疆一栋居民楼失火导致10人死亡，九人受伤。由于新冠封锁措施，当地许多居民已居家超过三个月。
"The fire began on the 15th floor of an apartment building in the Jixiangyuan neighborhood of Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, on Thursday evening, the city's Fire Department said. It later rose to engulf the two floors above, with smoke billowing up farther, the department said on its official account on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform.",新疆首府乌鲁木齐消防当局在其官方微博上表示，周四晚间，该市吉祥苑小区15层起火，火势后蔓延至17层，烟气扩散至更高楼层。
"The fire was ignited by a power strip that caught fire in a bedroom on the 15th floor, state media reported. Firefighters extinguished the blaze roughly three hours later, reports said. The authorities said that the dead and injured, who were taken to the hospital, had inhaled toxic fumes.",据官方媒体报道，火灾因15层一户卧室插线板起火导致。报道称消防员于三个小时后扑灭火情。当局表示死伤者均因吸入有毒烟气被送往医院救治。
"The blaze set off a flurry of questions on Chinese social media about whether Covid restrictions had hampered the rescue or prevented residents from escaping their apartments or the building. Much of Xinjiang, a region of 25 million people, has been under lockdown for more than 100 days as part of the authorities' heavy-handed response to Covid outbreaks. In some cases, the lockdowns have left residents in dire straits, with trouble securing food and other necessities, like medication and menstruation supplies.",在中国社交媒体上，关于新冠限制是否妨碍火灾救援或导致居民无法从家中、楼中逃生，引发了一系列疑问。新疆拥有2500万人口，由于当局对新冠疫情暴发的强硬应对，该地大部分地方已被封控100天以上。部分地方封控导致居民深陷困境，难以获得食物及其他必需品，例如药品及女性卫生用品。
"State media reports said the Jixiangyuan neighborhood where the fire occurred was a ""low-risk management"" area, a category of lockdown that allows residents to leave their compounds provided they self-monitor and avoid large gatherings.","据官方媒体报道，发生火灾的吉祥苑小区属""低风险""区，这一级别的封控允许居民下楼，前提是他们进行自我监测，避免聚集。"
"But many Chinese internet users were skeptical of the official account. They shared what appeared to be screenshots of conversations between the government and residents of the Jixiangyuan community indicating that the compound had recently been placed under a stricter level of lockdown, which could have made it harder for residents to get to safety.",但许多中国网民对官方说法表示质疑。他们转发了看上去是政府与吉祥苑小区的聊天截图，表明该小区近期处于更为严格的封控中，会导致居民难以安全逃生。
"Chinese commenters also pointed to video footage of what appeared to be attempts at putting out the fire as evidence that a lockdown had stalled the effort. The footage showed pressurized water from a fire hose spraying just out of reach of the burning building, suggesting that fire trucks may have been unable to get closer to the building because the community had been sealed off.",中国的评论人士也将看起来是在尝试灭火的视频作为封控拖延灭火的证据。视频显示从消防水带喷出高压水，但无法喷洒到起火的大楼，这表明由于小区遭到封控，消防车无法更靠近大楼。
"The accounts circulating on social media could not immediately be verified. Xinjiang is an ethnically divided region that has been under an intense government crackdown aimed at Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other largely Muslim minorities. Residents, particularly those of Uyghur descent, often face reprisals for speaking with the foreign media.",社交媒体上流传的说法无法立即得到证实。新疆是一个有多民族的地区，政府一直针对维吾尔族、哈萨克族等以穆斯林为主的民族进行严厉打压行动。当地居民、尤其是维吾尔族往往会因与外国媒体联系遭到报复。
But the descriptions of residents possibly sealed into their homes or compounds fit a broader pattern of how such lockdowns have been enforced in many parts of the country. Makeshift barricades and bolted doors have become a key feature of efforts to prevent people who might have been exposed to the virus from leaving their rooms and buildings.,但居民可能被封在家中或小区中的相关描述，符合中国许多地方封控执行的情况。临时路障和封锁大门都是为阻止那些可能接触病毒的人离开房间或楼宇的关键措施。
"Reached by phone on Friday, an officer at a nearby police station in Urumqi said they had no comment and referred reporters to official notices. Other neighborhood workers reached by phone also refused to comment.",周五，记者电话联系到了乌鲁木齐事发地附近一家警察局的警察，他表示无可奉告，并让记者去看官方通告。记者联系到的其他社区工作人员也拒绝置评。
Uyghur activists outside China who have sought to draw attention to the lengthy confinement of people in Xinjiang said the tragedy pointed to the failure of the authorities to protect the residents.,曾寻求外界关注新疆人民长时间被封控的维吾尔族活动人士表示，这场悲剧表明当局没能保护好居民。
"""People are not allowed to go outside easily without permission from the government,"" said Tahir Imin, a Uyghur academic based in Washington, D.C. ""My frustration is that the government is handling it very badly. They've showed that they don't care about the lives of the Uyghur people. How is the Fire Department unable to control this in three hours in a country like China with all its facilities and equipment and people?""","""人们没有获得允许无法轻易外出，""现居华盛顿的维吾尔族学者塔依尔·衣明(Tahir Imin)说。""我失望的地方在于政府处理得非常糟糕。他们表明了他们不在乎维吾尔人的生命。在中国这样拥有各种设施、设备和人力的国家，消防部门为什么会没能在三小时内控制火势?"""
"Online, Chinese internet users expressed anger and sadness, sharing articles with titles such as ""Last night's fire in Urumqi is the nightmare of all of Xinjiang's people."" They circulated black-and-white images calling for a moment of silence to ""express deep condolences to the 10 compatriots who died in the Urumqi fire."" Some residents offered their apartments to families who had lost their homes to the fire.","中国网民在网上表达了愤怒与悲伤，转发《昨晚的乌鲁木齐火灾，是所有新疆人民的噩梦!》等文章。他们传播呼吁""向乌鲁木齐火灾遇难的10位同胞致以沉痛哀悼""的黑白图片。一些居民为那些因火灾无家可归的人提供住所。"
"Questions about the cost of China's zero-tolerance approach to fighting Covid are posing a challenge for China's leader, Xi Jinping, as he enters his precedent-defying third term in power. Anger over lockdowns, as well as a widespread fear of the virus, have prompted large protests in the past two weeks by thousands of workers in the southern city of Guangzhou and at Apple's largest iPhone factory, in Zhengzhou, in central China.","对中国领导人习近平来说，关于中国对新冠""清零""付出代价的疑问正在对他打破先例获得的第三个任期构成挑战。围绕着对封控的愤怒，以及人们普遍对病毒的恐惧，已经在过去两周导致广州及郑州的苹果最大iPhone工厂数以千计的工人进行大规模抗议。"
"China has been grappling with a rise in Covid outbreaks, with cases around the country surging to record highs though still low by global standards. The tally on Friday neared 32,700 cases, of which close to 1,000 were recorded in Xinjiang.",中国已经在艰难应对新冠疫情暴发不断增加，全国各地新冠病例激增至破纪录水平——但以全球标准来说仍然很低。周五，新冠病例数字接近32700例，其中近1000例在新疆。
"The Urumqi fire was the second major tragedy to be reported this week. On Monday, a fire in a factory operated by an industrial equipment manufacturer in Henan Province killed 38 people, in one of the deadliest fires in several years.",乌鲁木齐的火灾是本周报告的第二例重大悲剧。周一，河南省一家工业设备生产商的厂房起火，导致38人丧生，这是数年来最为致命的火灾之一。
"""In recent years, it's become rare for fire accidents to cause more than 10 deaths,"" said Cai Weida, a lawyer and expert on fire safety in China. Mr. Cai said that considering the small scale of the fire, the Fire Department's response had been unusually slow. He attributed delays to a lack of space for fire trucks to maneuver, the unique challenges of a high-rise fire, and ""road barriers.""","""近年来，火灾导致10人以上死亡的情况很少见，""律师、中国消防安全专家蔡伟达说。他表示鉴于这场事故为小型火灾，消防部门的反应不同寻常地迟缓。他将延误归结于消防车缺乏移动的空间、高层起火的特有挑战以及""路障""。"
"In an iPhone factory in central China, thousands of workers clashed with riot police and tore down barricades.",在中国中部的一家iPhone工厂，数千名工人与防暴警察发生冲突并拆除了路障。
"In the southern city of Guangzhou, protesters broke out of locked-down buildings to confront health workers and ransack food provisions.",在南方城市广州，抗议者冲出被封控的大楼，与防疫人员对峙并洗劫了供应的食品。
"And online, many Chinese raged at the authorities after the death of a 4-month-old girl, whose father said access to medical treatment was delayed because of Covid restrictions.",在网上，许多中国人因一名4个月大的女婴之死对当局表达愤怒，该女婴的父亲说，受遏制新冠病毒措施的限制，孩子就医被延误。
"As China's harsh Covid rules extend deep into their third year, there are growing signs of discontent across the country. For China's leader, Xi Jinping, the unrest is a test of his precedent-breaking third term in power and underscores the urgent political question of how he can lead China out of the Covid era.",随着中国严厉的新冠病毒防控措施进入第三个年头，全国各地已出现了越来越多的不满迹象。对中国领导人习近平来说，这些骚乱是对他打破先例获得第三个任期后的考验，凸显了他将如何带领中国走出新冠防控时代这一紧迫的政治问题。
"The rare displays of defiance over the past two weeks are the most visible signs of frustration and desperation with the lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing that have upended everyday life. The anger, combined with outbreaks of Covid across the country that have driven cases to an all-time high, augurs a dark winter ahead.",过去两周里出现的罕见反抗，以最可见的方式展示了人们对封控、集中隔离和大规模核酸检测扰乱日常生活的沮丧和绝望。这些愤怒，加上全国各地的疫情将新冠感染病例推至近来的新高意味着，一个黑暗的冬天即将到来。
"Earlier this month, officials said they would adjust Covid restrictions to limit the impact the disruptions have had on the economy and government resources. The latest surge in cases has called that pledge into question, with many officials falling back on familiar heavy-handed measures to try to stop the spread of the virus.",官员们曾在本月早些时候表示将优化新冠病毒防控措施，以减少这些措施对经济和政府财政的影响。最近的感染病例激增让人们对政府的这个承诺产生了怀疑，许多官员为阻止病毒传播重新开始采取他们熟悉的高压措施。
Whether Mr. Xi can find a middle ground will reflect on China's status as the world's factory floor and a major driver of global economic growth. Some multinational companies are already looking to expand production elsewhere.,习近平能否找到一个折中办法，这关乎中国作为世界工厂和全球经济增长主要推动力的地位。一些跨国公司已在寻求去其他地方扩大生产。
"""What we're witnessing at Foxconn is the bankruptcy of 'the China model,'"" said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, referring to the Taiwanese operator of the plant in central China that produces half of the world's iPhones. ""It's the collapse of China's image as a production powerhouse, as well as China's relationship to globalization.""","""我们看到富士康就是中国模式的破产，""北京政治分析人士吴强说。他指的是在中国中部运营生产全球一半iPhone工厂的台湾制造商。"" 是中国这种生产模式，包括中国全球化的关系，这种模式的崩溃。"""
"Many will be watching to see if recent chaos at Foxconn's plant spreads elsewhere. Even before the riot that broke out at the plant this week, Apple had warned that a poorly organized lockdown there would impact its sales. Analysts have predicted longer waiting times for holiday purchases of the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.",许多人将关注富士康工厂最近的混乱是否会蔓延到其他地方。甚至在富士康工厂本周爆发骚乱之前，苹果就已警告说，组织不力的厂区封控将影响销售。分析人士预计，节日季节购买iPhone 14 Pro和14 Pro Max的人需等更长时间才能拿到手机。
"""If the government continues with its zero-Covid policy, Foxconn would only be the beginning. There is Foxconn today, but other factories will face similar situations,"" said Li Qiang, founder and executive director of China Labor Watch, a New York-based Chinese labor rights group.","""如果说它还要去继续执行它的清零政策，富士康只是一个开始，因为我想今天有富士康，还有别的工厂也会出现这种情况，""总部位于纽约的中国劳工权益组织""中国劳工观察""创始人兼执行董事李强说。"
The Foxconn workers were lashing out about a delay in the payment of bonuses as well as the Taiwanese assembler's failure to properly isolate new workers from those who had tested positive. The new hires had been recruited recently after thousands of workers fled the Foxconn plant last month because of a Covid outbreak.,富士康的工人对公司推迟发放奖金的做法，以及这家台湾组装商未能将新员工与核酸阳性员工妥善分隔起来大为不满。这些新员工是最近招募的，厂区上个月暴发疫情后，数千名工人逃离了工厂。
"From Tuesday evening until the dawn of Wednesday, thousands of workers clashed with riot police and health workers, according to four workers who spoke to The Times. Protesters destroyed barricades, stole food supplies and hurled pieces of fencing at the authorities.",据四名接受时报采访的工人说，从周二晚上到周三凌晨，数千名工人与防暴警察和防疫人员发生了冲突。抗议者摧毁了路障，偷了食物供应，还把拆下来的隔离栏杆投向当局派来的人。
"""We protested the whole day, from day to night,"" said Han Li, a new worker from Zhengzhou who had joined the protests. He said he had felt deceived, and that the bonus payments and living conditions at the factory were different from what he had been promised. Mr. Han said he saw workers get beaten and injured.","""我们抗议一整天，从早闹到晚上，""来自郑州的新工人、参加了抗议活动的韩力(音)说道。他表示，觉得自己被骗了，工厂的奖金和生活条件与承诺的不一样。韩先生说，他看到工人被打，有人受伤。"
"Videos that Foxconn workers shared with The Times showed workers, by the thousands, thrashing and hurling steel beams against police wearing riot gear and protective suits. One video, taken at dawn, showed the apparent aftermath: A motionless worker curled up on the roadside as a crew of security personnel stomped and kicked him. Another sat on the road with a bloodied sweater and towel wrapped over his head.",富士康工人与时报分享的视频显示，数千名工人用钢管与身穿防暴装备和防护服的警察打斗，将钢管投向后者。一段黎明时分拍的视频中似乎能看到夜间混乱的后果:一名工人蜷缩在路边，一动不动，一队安全人员踩他的身子，拿脚踢他。另一名工人坐在路上，他的毛衣上有血迹，头用毛巾裹着。
"In a statement, Foxconn attributed the delayed bonuses to ""a technical error"" in its hiring system. Regarding the violence, it vowed to work with employees and the government to ""prevent similar accidents from happening again.""","富士康在一份声明中，将推迟发放奖金的原因归咎于招聘系统的""技术错误""。至于暴力事件，公司承诺将与员工和政府合作，""避免类似事件再次发生""。"
"An Apple spokesman told the Times that Apple team members on the ground in Zhengzhou were ""reviewing the situation"" and were working with Foxconn ""to ensure their employees' concerns are addressed.""","苹果的一名发言人对时报说，苹果团队成员已在郑州现场""调查情况""，正在与富士康一起""确保员工的担忧得到解决""。"
"On Wednesday evening, Foxconn promised $1,400 to workers who wished to resign, offering them free transportation home.",周三晚，富士康承诺发给想辞职的工人一万元返乡费，并派车免费送他们回家。
"""It's all tears,"" Mr. Han said on Thursday. ""Now I just want to get my compensation and go home.""","""都是泪，""韩先生周四说。""现在只想拿到补偿然后返乡。"""
"In some ways, China's struggles are of Mr. Xi's own making. China has clung to harsh ""zero-Covid"" policies aimed at eradicating Covid infections, even as its vaccination efforts have lagged. For three years, Beijing pumped out propaganda in support of tough controls, arguing they were the only way to protect lives. It also described the terrifying consequences of the uncontrolled spread of the virus in much of the rest of the world.","在某种程度上，中国的困境是习近平本人造成的。中国一直坚持严厉的""新冠清零""政策，目的是消除新冠病毒感染，尽管国内的疫苗接种工作已落后于世界其他地方。三年来，中国政府的宣传机器大力支持严厉防控措施，辩称那是保护生命的唯一办法。官媒大肆宣传新冠病毒在世界其他许多地区不受控制的传播所造成的可怕后果。"
"At the same time, many others have questioned the need for lockdowns at all. This week, as millions of Chinese tuned in to watch the World Cup in Qatar, they saw unmasked crowds rooting for their favorite teams. Chinese social media users posted messages expressing sarcasm and envy, as they contrasted their cloistered lives with the raucous celebrations on TV.",与此同时，还有许多人已对封控的必要性提出疑问。本周，随着数以百万计的中国人观看在卡塔尔举行的世界杯足球赛，他们看到了大批不戴口罩的观众为他们喜爱的球队加油。中国社交媒体用户将自己与世隔绝的生活与电视上喧闹的庆祝场面进行对比，发贴表达了他们对中国做法的讽刺，以及对世界其他地方的羡慕。
"Mr. Xi, one of China's most powerful leaders in decades, has used heavy censorship and severe punishments to silence his critics. That makes the public airing of grievances particularly striking, such as in Guangzhou last week, when throngs of migrant workers staged a forceful protest after being confined for over three weeks.",习近平是中国几十年来权力最大的领导人之一，他用严格的审查制度和严厉惩罚使批评他的人噤声。这让中国人公开表达不满显得尤为引人注目，比如上周，广州的大批外来务工者在被禁家中三周多后进行了强烈抗议。
"In the locked-down district of Haizhu, home to roughly 1.8 million people, the workers, many of whom toil for long hours and low pay in Guangzhou's textile industry, rushed into the street to protest food shortages. They tore down fences and barricades, and videos circulating online showed another confrontation between residents and police.",被封控的海珠区住着大约180万人，其中许多人在广州纺织业工作，工作时间长，工资低。被封控后，工人涌上街头，抗议食品短缺问题。他们拆除了围栏和路障，网上流传的视频显示，抗议者与警察发生了冲突。
"As cases continue to climb, the government's pandemic prevention resources which include food, hospital beds and quarantine facilities have in some places been depleted, forcing workers to sleep on the streets or, in the case of Haizhu, in a tunnel, workers said.",随着新冠病毒感染病例继续攀升，有些地方的政府防疫资源——包括食品、医院床位和隔离设施——已经耗尽，迫使工人睡在街头，至于海珠的情况，据工人说是睡在隧道里。
"People have also been angered by reports of deaths caused by delays in medical care resulting from Covid restrictions. Earlier this month, the death of a 3-year-old boy in the city of Lanzhou after coronavirus restrictions kept him from being taken promptly to a hospital drew an outpouring of grief and anger as well as fresh scrutiny of the costs of ""zero Covid.""",人们也对遏制新冠病毒的措施导致医疗延误、致人死亡的报道感到愤怒。本月早些时候，兰州市一名三岁男童因新冠管控措施未能及时送医而死，引发了人们的悲伤和愤怒，也令人们重新审视新冠清零的代价。
"A similar outcry erupted online last week following the death of a 4-month-old girl whose father took to Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social media outlet, to describe delays in the emergency response. Due to Covid protocols, dispatchers declined to send an ambulance, and when one arrived, responders refused to take his daughter to a hospital. In total, it took 12 hours for her to receive help.",上周一名四个月大的女婴死亡后，网上也爆发了类似的抗议。女婴的父亲在微博上描述了紧急救援延误的情况。调度员援引新冠抗疫规定，拒绝派救护车。等救护车终于到达后，急救人员拒绝送他的女儿去医院。女婴得到救护之前整整经过了12个小时。
"""I hope the relevant departments will intervene, investigate a series of loopholes in epidemic prevention, inaction and irresponsibility, and seek justice for us ordinary people,"" wrote Li Baoliang, the baby's father. On Sunday, authorities released the results of an investigation into the incident. While the government expressed condolences to the family, it blamed the tragedy on individual medical staff who it said have a weak sense of responsibility.","""希望有关部门的介入，调查一系列的防疫漏洞不作为不负责现象，为我们普通老百姓讨个公道，""女婴的父亲李宝亮写道。周日，当局公布了对这件事的调查结果。政府向女婴家属表达了慰问，但将悲剧归咎于个别医护人员，称他们责任感薄弱。"
"Beneath Mr. Li's online complaint, many pointed to the harms being done by policies designed to protect the public.",在李宝亮发在网上的帖子下，许多人指出了名义上是为保护公众的政策正在制造的伤害。
"""What is taking people's lives? Is it Covid?"" asked one commenter.","""到底是什么在剥夺人民的性命?是新冠吗?""一位评论者写道。"
"HONG KONG The 65-year-old woman crouches in a field and holds up a head of cabbage. Behind her, two friends sway back and forth, cucumber and radish in their hands. ""This rotten cabbage, let's pull it out, eat it, achieve some foodie freedom,"" Guo Yifen, the woman with the cabbage, raps in a low and creaky voice in the song ""Spicy Hot Pot Real Rap.""","香港——这位65岁女人蹲在田里，手拿一棵生菜。她身后的两个朋友摇晃着，手里拿着黄瓜和萝卜。""烂了的生菜，是我照顾不周，拔了吧吃了吧，实现吃货自由。""在《麻辣烫真说唱》中，拿着生菜的女人郭义芬用低沉沙哑的声音唱道。"
"The trio, known as Sister Wang Is Coming, is known for sharing playful videos on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. Ms. Guo and her musical partners, Wang Shuping, 64, and Wang Xiurong, 66, have more than half a million followers who watch their food-related music videos, featuring jams like ""Fried Mushrooms"" and ""Country Food Rap.""","在抖音上，这个三人组合""王大姐来了""以发布好玩的视频而闻名。郭女士和她的说唱队友——64岁的王树平和66岁的王秀荣有超过50万的粉丝，人们观看她们制作的和食物相关的音乐视频，其中包括《炸了蘑菇》和《乡村美食说唱》等表演。"
"The group is part of a growing number of older Chinese who have found viral success sharing their daily lives online. In this corner of the Chinese internet, octogenarians croon, septuagenarians tango and gray-haired fashionistas strut down catwalks and offer makeup tips to millions of fans. There's even an 86-year-old man who just sits and plays video games like Call of Duty.",越来越多的中国老年人通过在网上分享自己的日常生活而爆红，该组合就属于其中之一。在中国互联网的这个角落，八十多岁的人唱歌、七十多岁的人跳探戈，满头白发的时尚达人自信地走秀，或是向数百万粉丝示范化妆技巧。甚至还有一位86岁的老人，他只是坐在那玩《使命召唤》等电子游戏。
"With more than 260 million residents over 60, China has the largest, and fastest-growing, population of old people in the world. Nearly half are online, where some choose to live out their professional dreams, while others are simply having a little fun. Many find companionship through their fans, an antidote to an otherwise lonely life. They are among a new generation of Chinese retirees who have fewer grandchildren than those before and the financial freedom to pursue hobbies and share their experiences online.",中国60岁以上的人口超过2.6亿，是世界上老年人口最多、增长最快的国家。这些人中将近一半的人上网，其中一些人选择实现自己的职业梦想，而另一些人则只是想找点乐子。许多人觉得粉丝是一种陪伴，可以缓解原本孤独的生活。他们属于新一代中国退休人群，和以前的人相比，没有那么多孙辈，而且财务自由，可以追求自己的爱好并在网上分享他们的经历。
"The singers, dancers and accidental celebrities are part of a global community of seniors who have embraced the highs, and sometimes lows, of social media.",这些歌手、舞者和偶然成名的人是全球老年人社区的一部分，他们欣然接受了社交媒体的潮起——以及偶尔的——潮落。
"In China, influencers are helping to challenge a particularly entrenched stereotype that grandparents are expected to stay home or help care for their families by cleaning, cooking and looking after their grandchildren while their adult children work. For some retirees, grandchildren aren't a factor at all, with more young Chinese rejecting marriage or choosing not to start a family.",在中国，网红们正在助力挑战一种尤为根深蒂固的刻板印象，即当成年子女工作时，祖父母应该留在家里帮忙操持家务——打扫卫生、做饭和照料孙辈。对于一些退休人士来说，完全不用考虑孙辈，因为越来越多的中国年轻人不想结婚或选择不组建家庭。
"""We look at our parents' old age and we think, we have to live in a different way,"" said Sun Yang, 66. A former English teacher who retired more than a decade ago, Ms. Sun and three of her friends are fashion influencers who go by the name Glamma Beijing. In their videos, they model vintage and modern clothes and weave style tips with everyday advice on life.","66岁的孙洋说:""以前当我们看到自己父母年老的时候，我们就想，要活得和他们不一样。""十多年前退休的英语教师孙洋和她的三个朋友现在是名为""时尚奶奶""的时尚网红。在她们的视频中，她们穿复古和现代服装走台步，并穿插发布搭配技巧与日常生活建议。"
"""What we do now is something we could only dream of when we were young,"" she said. Many of Glamma Beijing's more than two million followers are in their 50s and 60s. But there are younger ones, too, who ask the women about school and dating. Some say the tutorials helped them get over their fear of aging, Ms. Sun said.","""我们现在做的事儿，是我们以前只能梦想去做但没法儿实现的，""她说。""时尚奶奶""超过200万的关注者中有许多是五六十岁的人。但也有一些年轻人向这些女性请教学习和约会的建议。孙洋说，有的人说这些教程帮助他们克服了对衰老的恐惧。"
"The Glamma Beijing stars will occasionally feature family in their videos. Ms. Sun's daughter-in-law manages the social media account, and her 6-year-old granddaughter often helps film. But mostly, the four women talk about traveling, hiking and attending rehearsals for fashion shows.","""时尚奶奶""的明星们偶尔会在她们的视频中展示家庭。孙洋的儿媳负责管理社交媒体帐号，她六岁的孙女经常帮忙拍视频。但大多数情况下，这四位女性谈论的是旅行、远足和参加时装秀的彩排。"
"Independence is a common theme among many of the influencers' videos, as they push back against the thought that seniors should stay home in retirement and help raise the next generation.",独立是许多网红视频中的一个共同主题，他们反对老年人应该在退休后留在家中并帮助抚养下一代的想法。
"In the music videos by Sister Wang Is Coming, Ms. Guo and her friends run around in fields, playing pranks on one another, or lie in the grass and daydream. They rap about their love of cooking and eating. It's a world away from the daily routines they once had as mothers and wives with children to raise and husbands to feed.","在""王大姐来了""的MV中，郭女士和她的朋友们在田野里奔跑，或互相搞恶作剧，或躺在草丛中做白日梦。她们用说唱表达对做饭和享受美食的热爱。这与她们过去的日常生活相比恍如隔世，在过去，她们是母亲和妻子，要抚养孩子，喂饱丈夫。"
"""Times are changing,"" said Lin Wei, 67, another Glamma and a former nurse who vowed to stay active in her old age. ""We need to keep up with society and integrate into it.""","""现在时代也在变化，""另一位时尚奶奶、67岁的林玮说，她曾是一名护士，发誓要在晚年保持活力。""我们也要跟上社会、融入社会。"""
China is facing a host of demographic challenges including plummeting rates of marriages and a record-low number of births that have helped change the cultural norms around what growing old means. With one of the lowest retirement ages in the world the average is 60 for men and 55 for women Chinese seniors have plenty of time to pursue new creative endeavors online.,中国正面临着一系列人口挑战——包括直线下降的结婚率和创历史新低的出生率——这些挑战改变了人们对于衰老意味着什么的文化范式。作为世界上退休年龄最低的国家之一——男性平均退休年龄为60岁，女性平均退休年龄为55岁——中国老年人有充足的时间在网上进行新的创造性尝试。
"""For previous generations, their lives were more confined to within the family, watching TV and taking care of children,"" said Bei Wu, a professor of global health at New York University. ""But now this generation, because they have less grandchild-raising responsibilities, they have more leisure time, their scope of activity is beyond the family, and so the role of their friends and social lives is greater.""","""对于前几代人来说，他们的生活更局限于家庭、看电视和带孩子，""纽约大学全球健康教授吴蓓说。""但现在这一代人，因为带孙子的责任少了，闲暇时间多了，活动范围也超出了家庭，所以朋友和社交生活的比重更大了。"""
"For the foodie rapping grannies who live in a village near Beijing, the videos started as a way to pass the time during the pandemic. ""It was just having fun and messing around,"" said Wang Shuping. When Ms. Wang's son, Ren Jixin, came to visit over a Lunar New Year holiday, he thought he could help the women polish their act.","对于这三位居住在北京附近村庄的美食说唱大妈来说，这些视频最初是作为疫情期间打发时间的一种方式。""我们就是按照抖音里的一些动作瞎拍瞎胡闹，找快乐，""王树平说。她的儿子任继鑫春节时来看她，他认为他可以帮助这些大妈精进自己的表演。"
"""We sing out of tune. We are tone deaf,"" Ms. Guo said. Mr. Ren, a composer for documentary films, suggested the trio rap instead of sing, and he started writing lyrics for the group. This year, hundreds of thousands of people started to follow their Douyin account. Mr. Ren moved back home and now spends several days a week writing, rehearsing and filming.","""我们唱歌走调，五音不全，""郭义芬说。任继鑫是一名纪录片作曲家，他建议三人组用说唱代替唱歌，并开始为三人组写歌词。今年，数十万人开始关注他们的抖音帐号。任继鑫搬回家，现在每周花几天写作、排练和拍摄。"
"""It exercises our brain,"" Ms. Guo said of the content they create.","""锻炼脑子，""郭义芬在谈到他们创作的内容时说。"
"There's money in it, too. Through their Douyin account, Sister Wang Is Coming make about $1,400 a month. It's not enough to live on, but as their fan base grows, they have generated more interest from companies that want to advertise with them.","这样也能赚到钱。她们的抖音帐号""王大姐来了""每月收入约1万元。这并不足以维持生计，但随着粉丝数量的增长，她们吸引了更多公司的兴趣，想通过她们做广告。"
"For Glamma Beijing, streaming is much more lucrative. They can make more than $115,000 from advertising and sales commissions with just a handful of livestreams. In one such event in August, the four grandmothers sat by a lake in a Beijing park and talked about their youth as 21,000 people watched online.",北京的时尚奶奶们能通过流媒体赚更多的钱。她们仅通过少量直播就能靠广告和销售佣金赚取近20万元的收入。在今年8月的一次活动中，四位老奶奶坐在北京一个公园的湖边讲述她们的青春，有2.1万人在线观看。
"But success can have its challenges. Some older influencers in the country are managed by talent agencies that impose grueling quotas and demand their clients hawk products and brands. Fans can be fickle, and social media platforms like Douyin can bombard users with channels more focused on selling products than telling a good story.",但成功也面临挑战。在这个国家，老年网红由经纪公司管理，规定了苛刻的配额，要求其客户兜售产品和品牌。粉丝可能是善变的，抖音这样的社交媒体平台可能会用更专注销售产品而不是讲好故事的频道来轰炸用户。
"When Tang Shikun, 86, started filming himself singing in 2020, a thousand viewers would tune in each session. These days, only about 20 people watch Mr. Tang at any given time. Douyin has told his grandson, Tang Rui, who manages the account, that Mr. Tang's content is too simple and therefore doesn't get promoted on the platform.",86岁的唐士坤从2020年开始拍摄自己唱歌，当时每个视频都会有1000名观众收看。如今，任何时候，大约只有20人看他的演唱。抖音告诉他的孙子、管理该帐号的唐锐说，他的内容过于简单，因此无法在抖音平台上得到推广。
"That hasn't bothered Mr. Tang, who performs under the account name Grandpa Loves Singing. A former munitions inspector at a state-owned factory, Mr. Tang has been retired for 36 years. Music, he said, has given him fulfillment since he moved from northeastern China to the tropical southern province of Hainan in 2019.","这并没有困扰唐士坤，他的帐号是""爷爷爱唱歌""。唐士坤曾是一家国有工厂的军需品检查员，已经退休36年。他说，自2019年从中国东北搬到南部热带省份海南以来，音乐给了他满足感。"
"Mr. Tang, a widower, found it lonely at first living in a new city. ""Now I play the keyboard for people on Douyin, and I can get to know all the friends in the world,"" he said. There are some regulars in his daily sessions for whom Mr. Tang likes to play their favorite songs.","鳏居的唐士坤刚开始在一个陌生的城市生活时觉得很孤独。""现在我在抖音弹琴给网友听，天下的朋友都认识了，""他说。他的日常演唱能吸引一些常客，唐士坤喜欢为他们弹唱他们喜欢的歌曲。"
"One fan, a 50-year-old contractor who goes by the name ""Sunshine"" online, likes the traditional Mongolian ballad ""The Prairie Has a Blue River."" Another fan, a woman in her 50s from the southwestern province of Yunnan, once asked Mr. Tang's grandson for his bank account details. She sent him more than $2,000.","一个网名为""阳光灿烂""的50岁承包商粉丝喜欢蒙古传统民谣《草原上有一条蓝色的河》。另一位来自云南省的50多岁女性粉丝曾向唐士坤的孙子询问他银行账户的详细信息，给他转了至少15000元。"
"Mr. Tang said he had made more than $68,000 in tips and donations since he started posting his videos online two years ago. ""I play the keyboard and sing happily, and people who listen can also benefit from that happiness,"" he said. ""I think old people should have their own way of life,"" he added, ""not sit idle every day, but find their own hobbies to enjoy happiness.""","唐士坤说，自两年前开始在网上发布视频以来，他已经通过打赏和捐款赚了五六万。""我弹琴唱歌高高兴兴，在抖音听曲子的人也能受益也能快乐。我觉得老年人要有自己一个活法，不要攀比，也不要每天闲坐着。找到自己的爱好去享受快乐，""他说。"
"Less than a month after softening pandemic restrictions, China has reinstated some ""zero-Covid"" policies in an effort to control a new wave of infections surging across the country.","放宽疫情防控措施不到一个月，中国恢复了部分""清零""政策，以努力控制全国范围内的新一轮感染激增浪潮。"
"Covid-19 cases have climbed almost every day since late October, and China recently recorded its first coronavirus-related death in months. In response, officials have closed businesses, resumed citywide lockdowns and reinstated frequent testing requirements.",自10月下旬以来，新冠病例几乎每天都在攀升，最近还出现了数月来首例与新冠病毒相关的死亡病例。作为回应，官员们关闭了营业场所，重新封锁城市，并恢复了频繁的核酸检测要求。
"China stands alone as the only major country still going to extreme lengths to eradicate Covid-19 infections, raising questions about when, if ever, its economy might fully reopen.",中国是唯一一个仍采取极端措施根除新冠感染的大国，这引发了人们对其经济何时完全重新开放，甚至是否会重新开放的疑问。

"Earlier this month, a worker in protective gear kept watch near metal barriers that blocked off shuttered shops as part of Covid-19 controls in Beijing.",本月早些时候，一名身穿防护服的工作人员在铁板外看守，铁板将关闭的商店围了起来，这是北京的新冠防控措施之一。

"Barely a week after no longer requiring residents to show a negative Covid test to use mass transit, the authorities in the northern Chinese city of Shijiazhuang have locked down much of the city for five days as infections surge.",中国北方城市石家庄宣布居民乘公交不再需要出示新冠病毒阴性证明后仅一周，当地有关部门就因感染人数激增对该市大部分地区封控五天。
"In Shanghai, many neighborhoods have begun requiring frequent Covid tests again only days after telling residents that the tests were seldom needed.",上海许多社区告诉居民不再要求全区全员做核酸没过几天，又开始要求他们进行频繁的新冠病毒检测。
"And across much of Beijing, officials have ordered schools and many businesses to close as daily cases rose over the past week to more than 1,400 and the country acknowledged its first coronavirus-related deaths in months.",北京大部分地区的官员们下令学校停课、大部分营业场所暂停营业，这是因为日新增确诊病例在过去一周里不断增加，已超过每天1400例，而且政府还承认几个月来首次出现了与新冠病毒有关的死亡。
"China said earlier this month that it would fine-tune Covid restrictions to limit the disruption caused by lockdowns, quarantines and daily mass testing. Beijing's leaders were looking for ways to adjust the stringent measures that have isolated the country from much of the world, dragged its economy down and disrupted the lives of millions of citizens.",中国曾在本月早些时候宣布，将优化遏制新冠病毒的措施，以减少封控、集中隔离和每天大规模核酸检测对生活的干扰。中国遏制新冠病毒的严厉措施已使其孤立于世界大部分地区，拖累了经济，扰乱了数百万人民的生活，政府领导人正在寻找调整这些措施的办法。
"But in cities across the country, rapidly spreading outbreaks of Covid are testing the government's resolve to stick to its pledge and raising questions about when if ever the world's second largest economy might reopen.",但在全国各地的城市，新冠病毒疫情的快速蔓延正在考验政府坚持优化措施的决心，同时引发了人们对世界第二大经济体什么时候才能重新开放的问题——如果真有那么一天的话。
"""It's maybe 10 steps forward and nine steps back,"" said Chen Long, a policy analyst at Plenum, a Beijing consulting firm.","""中国可能是前进十步，后退九步，""北京咨询公司Plenum的政策分析师陈龙说。"
"China's tally of new infections has almost climbed every day since late October, with over 25,000 cases a day now scattered across every province in the country. The number of cases announced on Tuesday, 27,307, came close to China's single-day record of 28,973, set on April 14 during the early days of the Shanghai lockdown.",自今年10月下旬以来，中国的新增确诊病例几乎每天都在上升，各个省份每天都有新确诊病例出现，全国的现有确诊病例数已超过2.5万例。周二公布的确诊病例数为27307例，与上海在4月14日的封城初期创下的中国单日记录28973例接近。
"According to Nomura, a Japanese brokerage, 49 cities representing a third of China's population and two-fifths of its economic output are now under partial or complete lockdowns, a sharp increase from a week earlier.",据日本券商野村的数据，目前有49个城市处于部分或全面封控状态，与一周前相比大幅增加，占到中国三分之一的人口和五分之二的经济产出。
"China is the only major country in the world still attempting to eradicate Covid infections three years into the pandemic, with the ruling Communist Party asserting that it is the only way to protect Chinese lives. But even as Beijing vows to maintain a zero tolerance approach, officials have started to acknowledge the strain it is having on resources.",中国是世界上仍在努力消灭新冠病毒的唯一大国，执政的中共坚称，这是保护人民生命的唯一办法。但就在中国政府郑重表示坚持新冠清零不动摇的同时，官员们已开始承认清零政策带来财政压力。
"When Chinese officials announced on Nov. 11 they were working to make the containment strategy more precise, they cited a shortage of quarantine beds and facilities, as well as a shortage of people for contact tracing work. They introduced changes to the rules, among them a halt to the quarantine of the personal contacts of contacts of people who had the virus, and discouraged mass testing.",11月11日，中国官员宣布正在努力制定更精准的防控措施时提到了集中隔离床位和设施短缺，以及追踪密接者的工作人员短缺等问题。政府对防疫规定进行了调整，包括不再对病毒感染者的次密接进行集中隔离，不鼓励做全员核酸检测。
"The changes were a relief to citizens like Yin Wenbo, a 41-year-old kindergarten teacher in Shijiazhuang, which immediately stopped requiring a negative P.C.R. test to ride public transportation or enter many buildings. ""We all have to work, and sooner or later we need to face it besides Covid, there are many other infectious diseases, so you will never go out?"" she said.","这些调整让许多人感到宽慰，比如石家庄市41岁的幼儿园教师尹文波(音)。石家庄在优化政策出台后马上宣布，不再要求市民在乘坐公交或进入许多建筑时出示核酸阴性证明。""我们都得上班，我们迟早要面对它，除了新冠病毒，还有许多其他传染病，难道叫人永远不出门了?""她说。"
"Other residents were less sanguine. Fears of a rapid spread of infection prompted families to strip shelves of herbal cold and flu remedies, and call for the city to protect them from Covid. As cases did indeed begin to climb, Shijiazhuang announced on Sunday that it would require five days of mass testing across the city and told most residents to stay home.",有些人则没有这么乐观。由于担心感染会迅速传播，中药和感冒药物被抢购一空，一些人还要求石家庄政府保护他们不被新冠病毒感染。随着确诊病例的确在放松管控后开始上升，石家庄已在周日宣布，将在全市范围内进行为期五天的大规模核酸检测，并要求大多数居民呆在家里。
"As the new lockdowns and on-again, off-again rounds of testing show, officials at the provincial and city level are likely to err on the side of extreme caution, given the risk of being dismissed for outbreaks, as has been the case since the start of the pandemic.",正如新的封控以及时断时续的核酸检测所表明的，省市级官员宁可过于谨慎，也不愿冒下因防控不力免职的风险——自疫情开始以来，这种事情已多次发生。
"There are longer-term challenges to any effort to tweak the ""zero Covid"" strategy. Most Chinese have never been exposed to the virus. Vaccination efforts have petered out over the summer and autumn. That has left a population with scant immunity, public health experts warn. No significant relaxation of Covid restrictions is likely unless the country ratchets up its national vaccination program.","任何调整""新冠清零""策略的努力都是长期的艰巨任务。大多数中国人都没有接触过新冠病毒。国内的疫苗接种工作已在夏秋两季逐渐减少。公共卫生专家警告，这两个原因使得中国人缺乏免疫力。除非中国加强全国范围的疫苗接种工作，否则遏制新冠病毒的措施不太可能有大的放松。"
"""That's really important, that's the number one most important thing to do in China,"" said Jin Dongyan, a Hong Kong virologist.","""这真的很重要，这是中国最重要的事情，""香港病毒学家金冬雁说。"
"Hospitals are only starting now to expand intensive care units for a wave of serious infections. Little effort has been made to set up triage centers that could, in case of a big wave of infections, send only the most seriously ill to hospitals and send everyone else home to recuperate.",国内的医院现在才开始为应对一波严重感染，扩大重症监护病房。医院几乎没有在建立分诊中心方面做出任何努力。一旦发生大规模感染，分诊中心可以将病情最重的人送进医院，让其他人回家疗养。
"""In early spring they were talking about how hospitals would not be needed to treat minor cases, but that has not been the case,"" as even asymptomatic cases continue to be hospitalized, said Yanzhong Huang, a public health specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.","""他们曾在今年早春讨论了不要将轻症患者送进医院治疗的事情，但他们并没有那样做，""美国外交关系委员会的公共卫生专家黄严忠说，目前的情况是，就连无症状感染者也要在医院住好几天。"
"Many in China are terrified of any infection because the country's vast propaganda apparatus has spent the entire pandemic instilling terror of the virus with lurid reports of mass death and numerous ""long Covid"" cases in other countries.","中国的许多人对新冠病毒谈虎色变，因为政府庞大的宣传机器在整个疫情期间一直在向人们灌输对这种病毒的恐惧，对其他国家的大量死亡和许多""新冠长期症状""患者进行耸人听闻的报道。"
"In southern China, rapid antigen tests for Covid are in short supply as local governments run short of money for the free sidewalk P.C.R. tests that they have offered until now.",在中国南方，随着地方政府已经没有钱提供免费的核酸检测，新冠病毒快速抗原检测盒已供不应求。
"Joanna Yeung, a 25-year-old resident of Guangzhou, is mulling whether to buy an oximeter for her parents. ""It may be difficult to see a doctor when the number of cases rises,"" she said.","25岁的广州居民乔安娜·杨正在考虑是否给父母买一个血氧仪。""感染新冠的人数上升后，可能会出现就医难的情况，""她说。"
"Citizens will only be reassured, said Wang Xiangwei, a Beijing commentator and newsletter writer, when trusted health experts appear on television to discuss the lack of severity of the Omicron variant for those who have been vaccinated, particularly young people who also have strong immune systems. A possible candidate, he said, was Zhong Nanshan, who helped uncover the SARS outbreak in 2003 and played a key role in drawing national attention to the initial Covid outbreak in Wuhan nearly three years ago.",北京的评论员和时事通讯撰稿人王向伟说，让老百姓放心的唯一办法是，让值得信赖的卫生专家在电视上露面讨论，对接种过疫苗的人(尤其是免疫系统正常的年轻人)来说，奥密克戎变异株不会导致严重疾病。他说，钟南山是一名可能有这种能力的人，他曾帮助公开了2003年的SARS疫情，并在近三年前让全国关注最早出现在武汉的新冠病毒上起过关键作用。
"There's also a question of resources. China has not clearly detailed who will pay for medical care if a wave of cases finally occurs, raising fears among many citizens of financial strains. The country's public health insurance system provides only limited coverage.",还有资金问题。中国还没有明确规定，如果最终出现一波大规模感染的话，医疗费用由谁来承担，这让许多经济紧张的民众担忧。中国的公共医疗保险体系只提供有限的覆盖范围。
"This is a concern for Ken Feng, a 50-year-old blue-collar worker in Shenzhen, who worries that his parents could be among the first to succumb.",这是50岁的深圳蓝领工人肯·冯担心的问题，他担心自己的父母可能会成为第一批感染者。
"""If one person is infected, it may cause more infections, and may lead to a lot of pressure on the entire family's finances,"" he said.","""如果家里有一个人被感染，就可能会感染更多的人，可能会给整个家庭带来很大的经济压力，""他说。"
The biggest worry among public health experts is that China's vaccination effort has dribbled away to almost nothing.,让公共卫生专家最担心的是，中国的疫苗接种工作已逐渐减少到几乎不存在的程度。
"When China began large-scale vaccination at the end of 2021, it reserved scarce doses for working-age adults. Health officials warned older adults against being vaccinated, cautioning that there might be side effects advice that has been hard to reverse and has contributed to lingering vaccine hesitancy. A third of the country's citizens aged 60 or older have never had a booster shot.",中国在2021年底开始大规模接种时，曾把数量不多的疫苗留给工作年龄段的成年人。卫生官员警告老年人不要接种疫苗，说接种疫苗可能会有副作用，这个建议已很难逆转，并导致老年人对接种疫苗始终犹豫不决。中国60岁以上的公民中有三分之一从未接种过第三针。
"In the spring and summer of last year, China was vaccinating about 25 million people a day as it rolled out its own vaccines. In the past week, it has been 120,000 to 220,000 a day.",去年春夏两季，中国推出国产疫苗时，每天曾约有2500万人接种疫苗。过去一周里的这个数字每天仅12万到22万人。
"The urgency of ramping up vaccinations grows with every day that more Covid infections slip through China's ""zero Covid"" net, making the economic toll ever harder to mitigate. Many eateries and other small businesses have closed permanently as families and migrant workers stay home to avoid getting caught in quarantines or lockdowns. Retail sales shrank last month compared to October of last year, the government disclosed last week.","随着中国的""新冠清零""政策并未能遏制新冠病毒感染数字的增长，清零的经济损失越来越难以得到缓解，加大疫苗接种力度的紧迫性与日俱增。由于民众和农民工为避免被集中隔离或被封控，选择待在家中，许多餐馆和其他小企业已永久停业。政府上周披露，今年10月份的零售额与去年同期相比有所下降。"
"""Continuing this for the next few years just doesn't make sense any more, given the socioeconomic costs,"" said Richard Reithinger, a global health expert at the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina.","""考虑到这种做法的社会经济成本，未来几年继续做下去已没有任何意义，""北卡罗来纳州三角研究院的全球健康专家理查德·雷辛格说。"
"But China is unwilling to endure a wave of cases that would inevitably be set off by any easing of measures, said Andy Chen, a senior analyst in the Shanghai office of Trivium China, a policy consultancy.",但中国不愿经受一波大规模感染的考验，而任何放松管控的做法都将不可避免地引发大规模感染，政策咨询公司策纬上海办公室的高级分析师安迪·陈说。
"""They will definitely lock down hard again if cases get out of control,"" he said, adding, ""It's really hard to see how they get out of it.""","""如果感染病例失控的话，他们肯定会再次采取严格封控措施，""他说，""真的很难看出他们如何走出这种困境。"""
"A fire swept through a two-story factory in central China on Monday, killing 38 people in one of the most deadly fires in the country in recent years.",周一，一场大火席卷了中国中部一座两层高的厂房，导致38人死亡，该事件也是中国近年来最为致命的火灾之一。
"According to a statement from local officials, the fire started at around 4 p.m. at Kaixinda Trading, a wholesaler that deals in a range of goods, in Anyang, a city in Henan Province known as a high-tech development zone that was once an ancient Chinese capital. Teams of rescue workers extinguished the fire by around 11 p.m., state media reported.",当地官员发布的通告显示，这场火灾发生时间约为下午四点，地点是凯信达商贸有限公司，这是安阳一家批发各类货物的公司。在河南，安阳市作为一处高科技发展区而闻名，在古代，该地也是一座古都。据官方媒体报道，救援队伍在晚上11点左右将火扑灭。
"On Tuesday, state media attributed the cause of the fire to electrical welding that violated regulations. In a statement released on Monday, the Anyang police said they had ""placed relevant suspects under control.""","周二，官方媒体将起火原因归结为违规电焊操作。在周一发布的一则通告中，安阳警方表示""相关嫌犯已被控制""。"
"A video shared by state media showed a bright-orange fire raging at the end of a street, as firefighters fastened a hose onto a fire truck and a column of smoke billowed up. State media reported on Tuesday that the fire was fueled by the burning of ""plastics, cloths, furnitures and medications, among others.""","官方媒体转发的一则视频显示了道路尽头橘黄色的熊熊火焰，消防员则在一旁将水管固定在消防车上，画面中一股浓烟腾起。官方媒体周二报道称这场火灾由""塑料、布料、家具、药品等""着火导致。"
"Kaixinda Trading sells, among others, clothing, furniture, chemical products and industrial equipment. It was established in 2007, according to public records.",凯信达商贸有限公司出售服装、家具、化学产品及工业设备等。公开记录显示，该公司成立于2007年。
The company did not respond to requests for comment.,该公司没有对置评请求作出回应。
"In 2013, a fire in a poultry plant in Jilin province killed 120 people and stirred public outrage over workplace safety concerns. State media outlets reported at the time that doors and windows at the factory had been locked to keep workers from leaving during work hours. Similar accusations were reported after a 1993 fire at a Shenzhen doll factory that killed 81 people.",2013年，吉林省一家禽业工厂发生火灾，导致120人死亡，围绕着对工作场所的安全担忧的问题引发公众愤怒。官方媒体当时报道，该工厂为了不让工人在上班时间离开，将门窗锁住。1993年，深圳一家玩具娃娃工厂起火导致81人死亡后，也出现过对类似指控的报道。
"After a deadly factory blast in Jiangsu killed 69 workers and injured hundreds more in 2014, President Xi Jinping ordered an investigation and Li Keqiang, China's premier, called for more stringent safety checks at factories across the country, according to a government statement at the time.",2014年，江苏一起致命工厂爆炸事故导致69名工人死亡，数以百计人受伤。事故发生后，根据一份官方声明，习近平下令进行调查，时任总理李克强则呼吁在全国各地的工厂进行更为严格的安全检查。
"In recent years, China has moved to reduce factory accidents and fire regulations around fire management in dense areas have proliferated.",近年来，中国已开始采取措施减少工厂事故，人口稠密地区围绕消防管理的防火规范也已大幅增加。
"""Just because there are laws and regulations does not mean there are guarantees"" of safety, said Jiang Dining, a fire safety expert and a member of the Chinese Fire Protection Association.","""不是有法规了，就有了保证""，消防安全专家、中国消防协会成员姜迪宁说。"
"Mr. Jiang called the Henan blaze a ""particularly serious fire,"" a term used in his field for fires that kill more than 30 people or cause 100 million yuan, or $13 million, in damages. Monday's fire was the first in China to claim that many lives in the past years, he said.","他还将河南大火称为""特别重大火灾""，这一说法在他的领域里被用来描述导致超过30人死亡或造成100万以上经济损失的火灾。周一的事故是中国多年来首个导致如此多人丧生的火灾，他说。"
"TAIPEI, Taiwan The job offer from a Chinese semiconductor company was appealing. A higher salary. Work trips to explore new technologies.",台湾台北——一家中国的半导体公司提供的工作机会很有吸引力。薪水更高。还可以公费出差去考察新技术。
"No matter that it would be less prestigious for Kevin Li than his job in Taiwan at one of the world's leading chip makers. Mr. Li eagerly moved to northeast China in 2018, taking part in a wave of corporate migration as the Chinese government moved aggressively to build up its semiconductor industry.",但对凯文·李来说，开出的条件再好，还是不如他在台湾一家全球领先的芯片制造商上班体面。2018年，中国政府大力发展半导体行业之际，凯文·李迫不及待地搬到中国东北，成为一波企业迁徙潮中的一员。
"He went back to Taiwan after two years, as Covid-19 swept through China and global tensions intensified. Other highly skilled Taiwanese engineers are going home, too.",两年后，随着新冠疫情席卷中国，全球紧张局势加剧，他回到了台湾。其他一些掌握高技能的台湾工程师也纷纷打道回府。
"For many, the strict pandemic measures have been tiresome. Geopolitics has made the job even more fraught, with China increasingly vocal about staking its claim on Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy. The Taiwanese government has begun to discourage local engineers from going to China, concerned that they were taking proprietary information with them.",对许多人来说，严格的防疫措施已经够令人烦了。地缘政治使得工作变得更加让人焦虑，因为中国越来越强烈地提出对民主自治的台湾的主权要求。台湾政府开始劝阻工程师前往中国工作，担心他们带走专业情报。
"""Some who went to work in China were villains who exchanged secrets for money,"" said Mr. Li, 40. ""Some wanted to be free from the work pressures in Taiwan. And there were those who seriously wanted to explore new areas.""","""过去(中国工作)的人，就是一些带机密换财富的小人，""40岁的凯文·李说。""有想脱离在台湾工作压力的人，有认真想去拓荒的人。"""
"The prospects that enticed Taiwanese engineering talent to China, feeding a pipeline for lagging Chinese semiconductor companies hoping to compete with global rivals, are rapidly diminishing.",吸引台湾工程人才到中国、为希望参与全球竞争但处于落后的中国半导体企业提供人才管道的前景正在迅速消失。
"Semiconductors are now vital strategic assets in the pitched geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China. As Washington tries to crimp China's capacity to make advanced chips, Taiwan, the world's biggest producer of high-end semiconductors, finds itself at the center of what some are calling the 21st century's version of the arms race. While President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, adopted a warmer tone at their first face-to-face presidential meeting this week, it was clear that Taiwan remained a serious point of contention between the two countries.",在美中激烈的地缘政治竞争中，半导体现在是至关重要的战略资产。随着华盛顿试图削弱中国制造先进芯片的能力，世界上最大的高端半导体生产地——台湾——发现自己处于一些人所谓的21世纪版军备竞赛的中心。虽然拜登总统和中国国家主席习近平在本周举行的双方首次面对面会晤中采取了较为温和的语气，但很明显，台湾仍然是两国之间一个严重的争议点。
"Taiwan itself faces increasing unease in Washington. The secretary of commerce, Gina Raimondo, and others have said that, even though the United States continues to support Taiwan militarily, it needs to be less dependent on the island democracy for the chips needed in sophisticated weapons.",台湾自身在华盛顿也面临着日益加剧的不安。商务部长吉娜·雷蒙多等人表示，虽然美国继续在军事上支持台湾，但它需要在先进武器所需的芯片方面减少对这个民主岛屿的依赖。
"Sweeping bans imposed by the Biden administration last month targeting China's chip industry have put the island's premier chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, on the front line of likely disruptions to the global supply chain. Adding to the pressure, the Biden administration has pressed TSMC into building a plant in Arizona to help diversify the United States' sources of chips.",拜登政府上个月对中国芯片行业实施全面禁令，将台湾主要的芯片制造商台积电推到了可能出现的全球供应链扰动的前沿。此外，拜登政府还向台积电施压，要求它在亚利桑那州设厂，帮助美国实现芯片来源的多元化。
"Beijing has blasted the new rules, saying they ""will not only harm Chinese companies' legitimate rights and interests but also hurt the interests of U.S. companies."" And the Chinese government, which is pushing its own strategy of self-reliance in key areas like semiconductors, is expected to retaliate in ways that could punish TSMC.","北京抨击了美国的新举措，称它们""不仅损害了中国企业的合法权益，也会对美国企业造成严重影响""。中国政府正在半导体等关键领域推行自力更生战略，预计它将以可能波及台积电的方式进行报复。"
"The Chinese government, for example, could bar the American companies that build data centers in China from using high-end chips manufactured by TSMC, said Jason Hsu, a former Taiwanese legislator who is now at the Harvard Kennedy School.",例如，中国政府可以禁止在中国建立数据中心的美国公司使用台积电生产的高端芯片，台湾前立法委员、现就职于哈佛大学肯尼迪学院的许毓仁表示。
"So far, TSMC said, the impact of the new rules has been limited. The administration granted a one-year waiver to the company, allowing it to continue expanding its facility in the Chinese city of Nanjing. TSMC also has a plant in Shanghai.",台积电表示，到目前为止，新规定的影响有限。政府给予该公司为期一年的豁免，允许其继续扩大在南京的生产设施。台积电在上海也有一家工厂。
"But Washington has barred Chinese and Taiwanese engineers with U.S. citizenship or a green card from working in China's chip-making facilities. The ban will force about 200 Chinese and Taiwanese engineers to either leave China or give up their U.S. citizenship, Mr. Hsu said.",但华盛顿禁止拥有美国国籍或绿卡的中国大陆和台湾工程师在中国的芯片制造工厂工作。许毓仁说，这项禁令将迫使大约200名大陆和台湾工程师离开中国或放弃其美国公民身份。
"""This has such a chilling effect on every Taiwanese national working in the semiconductor industry in China. Everyone is on edge,"" Mr. Hsu said. ""What if a U.S. government intelligence agency thinks you are violating U.S. security and wants to arrest you?""","""这让每一个在中国半导体行业工作的台湾人都产生了寒蝉效应。所有人都很紧张，""许毓仁说。""如果美国政府情报机构认为你侵犯了美国的安全，要逮捕你，怎么办?"""
"For years, China poached Taiwan's semiconductor engineers, who often have Ph.D.s and are essential to keeping the world's most advanced chip-making factories humming.",多年来，中国大陆一直在挖走台湾的半导体工程师，这些工程师通常拥有博士学位，对维持世界上最先进的芯片制造工厂的运转至关重要。
"In 2019, about 3,000 Taiwanese semiconductor engineers were working in China, nearly 10 percent of the 40,000 engineers at the heart of the industry's work force, according to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, an independent group.",根据独立组织台湾经济研究院的数据，2019年，约有3000名台湾半导体工程师在中国大陆工作，占该行业劳动力中四万名核心工程师的近10%。
"A handful of senior executives also joined rival Chinese firms, including the country's most prestigious, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, which is based in Shanghai. Chinese state entities are among the company's major shareholders, and the Pentagon has expressed concerns that SMIC has ties to the Chinese military. SMIC did not respond to requests for comment.",少数高管也加入了中国竞争对手的公司，包括中国最负盛名的中芯国际，其总部位于上海。中芯国际的主要股东包括了政府实体，五角大楼对中芯国际与中国军方有联系表示了担忧。中芯国际没有回应记者的置评请求。
"One former TSMC executive, Liang Mong-song, a prized engineer who had been the company's director of research and development, joined SMIC as co-chief executive in 2017. Last year, China's state-run media reported that Mr. Liang led a team of engineers who developed SMIC's seven-nanometer chip technology, a more advanced chip than the company had previously made, and a sudden breakthrough that partly drove the Biden administration to announce its new rules.",台积电的前高管梁孟松是一位受人尊敬的工程师，曾任公司研发总监，2017年加入中芯国际，担任联席首席执行官。去年，中国官方媒体报道称，梁孟松带领一个工程师团队开发了中芯国际的七纳米芯片技术，这比中芯国际之前生产的芯片更先进，是一项突如其来的突破，在一定程度上推动了拜登政府宣布新规定。
"Another former TSMC senior executive, Chiang Shang-yi, had hoped to work on a new method of producing microchips at the Shanghai company. In an interview this year with the Computer History Museum in California, he said going to China was ""one of the foolish things"" that he had done. Mr. Chiang left SMIC last year.","台积电另一位前高管蒋尚义曾希望在这家上海公司研究一种生产微芯片的新方法。在今年接受加州计算机历史博物馆采访时，他表示，去中国是他做过的""一件蠢事""。蒋尚义去年离开了中芯国际。"
"Taking a job at a Chinese company has always been dicey for Taiwanese engineers, said Syaru Shirley Lin, a Taiwanese economist and a former partner at Goldman Sachs specializing in the tech industry. ""People would say, 'Did you go there?'"" she said. ""Soon, it will be like going to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.""","曾在高盛担任科技行业合伙人的台湾经济学家林夏如说，对台湾工程师来说，在大陆公司工作一直是件冒险的事。""人们会说，'你去过那里吗?'""她说。""很快，就会像去冷战时期的苏联一样。"""
"Evonne Wang, 31, looked for a job in China to broaden her experience beyond TSMC.",31岁的伊芳·王在中国找了一份工作，以扩大自己在台积电以外的经验。
"Several headhunting firms offered her opportunities, but she settled on an American company based in China. She figured that if she went to a Chinese company her reputation might be tarnished when she returned home.",几家猎头公司给她提供了机会，但她最终选择了一家设在中国的美国公司。她想，如果她去了一家中国公司，回台湾后她的声誉可能会受损。
"""Some Taiwanese semiconductor companies have qualms about previous experiences of working in China,"" said Ms. Wang, who also returned to Taiwan as Covid took hold.","""有的台湾半导体公司会对之前在中国的工作经验有疑虑，""伊芳·王说，她也在新冠疫情暴发时返回了台湾。"
"With China making industry advances, Taiwan has begun to take measures to stop the brain drain and protect a core economic driver. The island's economy grew more than 6 percent last year, in part from the surge in global demand for semiconductors.",随着中国大陆工业的进步，台湾已开始采取措施，阻止人才流失，保护一个核心经济驱动力。台湾经济去年增长超过6%，部分原因是全球对半导体的需求激增。
"Gin Chang, 30, a Taiwanese engineer who worked in southern China for a year and doubled his salary, said he understood the growing unease in Taiwan about its young engineers' contributing to China's growth.",30岁的台湾工程师金·张(音)在中国南方工作了一年，工资翻了一番。他说，他理解台湾对其年轻工程师为中国经济增长做出贡献而日益感到不安。
"""I don't think there should be restrictions on us working in China,"" Mr. Chang said. ""But from the perspective of the government in Taiwan, if the Chinese economy grows because of its growing semiconductor industry, then Taiwan's economic situation could be endangered.""","""我认为我们在中国工作不应该受到限制，""金·张说。""但从台湾政府的角度来看，如果中国大陆经济增长是因为其不断增长的半导体产业，那么台湾的经济形势可能会受到威胁。"""
"Under regulations introduced in early 2021, headhunters in Taiwan are barred from advertising jobs in China's microchip industry. The Ministry of Justice established a task force that ordered raids on Chinese firms operating in Taiwan. The Chinese companies were suspected of being fronts created to recruit local engineers for jobs in China; more than 40 cases of poaching workers and stealing secrets have been prosecuted since last year, the government said in September.",根据2021年初出台的规定，台湾猎头公司不得发布关于中国微芯片行业的招聘广告。台湾法务部成立了一个特别工作组，会受命突查在台运营的中国企业。这些中国企业被怀疑是为招聘当地工程师到中国工作而设的幌子;台湾政府9月表示，自去年以来，已经起诉了40多起挖角和窃密案件。
"Much of the poaching involved Chinese companies trying to capture Taiwanese expertise, applying that knowledge in their plants and then ditching the workers, said one headhunter, Michael Lo.",一位名叫迈克尔·卢(音)的猎头表示，大部分挖角行为都与试图获取台湾专业技能的中国企业有关，它们会将这些知识应用到自己的工厂，然后解雇工人。

"Mr. Li, the engineer who went back home, had worked his way up the Taiwanese semiconductor industry. He had four jobs at smaller companies before joining TSMC at its headquarters in Hsinchu Science Park, a campus sometimes known as Taiwan's Silicon Valley, 30 minutes by high-speed train from Taipei, the capital.","那位回国的工程师凯文·李曾在台湾半导体行业一路摸爬滚打。在加入新竹科学园——该园区有时被称为台湾""硅谷""，从首都台北乘高铁30分钟即可抵达——的台积电总部之前，他曾在规模较小的企业做过四份工作。"
"TSMC is the pride of Taiwan. Visitors to its main building, set in lush foliage, are greeted by a striking sign with the name of the company's founder, Morris Chang. One of Taiwan's multibillionaires, Mr. Chang, 91, grew up in China, attended Harvard and M.I.T. and worked at Texas Instruments before starting TSMC in 1987.",台积电是台湾的骄傲。其主楼坐落于葱郁树林之中，来访者会看到一个醒目的标志，上面写着公司创始人张忠谋的名字。现年91岁的张忠谋是台湾的亿万富豪之一，在中国长大，曾就读于哈佛大学和麻省理工学院。在1987年创办台积电之前，他曾在德州仪器工作。
"When Mr. Li arrived at TSMC, he felt lucky but found it a slog inside the foundry, he said.",当凯文·李来到台积电，他说感觉自己很幸运，但发现在代工厂里干活的日子很艰苦。

"Even so, when the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, held talks on Tuesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, the official Chinese summary of Mr. Wang's comments suggested that Beijing has become more guarded about the course of the war, even while it tries to maintain a partnership with Mr. Putin.",然而，在中国外交部长王毅周二与俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫会谈后，中方对王毅讲话的官方总结表明，北京虽仍试图与普京保持伙伴关系，但已对战争进程变得更加谨慎。
"Mr. Wang said that China welcomed recent Russian comments denying it might use nuclear weapons over Ukraine, despite recent discussions among senior Russian officials about how Moscow might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, as The New York Times has reported.",王毅说，中国欢迎俄罗斯最近否认可能在乌克兰使用核武器的表态，尽管据《纽约时报》报道，俄罗斯高级官员最近在讨论莫斯科可能在乌克兰使用战术核武器的问题。
"""China has noted that Russia recently reaffirmed its established position that nuclear war must not and cannot be fought, and this is a rational and responsible stance by Russia,"" Mr. Wang said, according to the summary of the talks issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.","据中国外交部发布的会谈纪要，王毅表示，""中方注意到俄方近日重申核战争打不得、不能打的既定立场，这是俄方理性和负责任的态度。"""
"The meeting appeared to have taken place before news spread that two Polish citizens had died in an explosion near Poland's border with Ukraine. Mr. Lavrov has since departed the summit to return to Russia, Russian state media reported.",这次会晤似乎是在两名波兰公民在波乌边境附近爆炸中丧生的消息传出之前举行的。据俄罗斯官方媒体报道，拉夫罗夫之后离开峰会返回了俄罗斯。
"Mr. Wang seemed to be referring to comments that Mr. Putin made in late October, when he denied that Moscow was preparing to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. ""We have no need to do this,"" Mr. Putin said. ""There's no sense for us, neither political nor military.""","王毅指的似乎是普京在10月底发表的言论，当时他否认莫斯科准备在乌克兰战争中使用核武器。""我们没有必要这么做，""普京说。""这对我们来说毫无意义，无论是政治上还是军事上。"""
"Mr. Putin's denial stands against the assessments of senior American officials, who were alarmed by the Russian military leaders' discussions over possibly using a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. In a speech in late September, Mr. Putin made a cryptic reference to the atomic bombs that the United States dropped on Japan in 1945.",普京的否认与美国高级官员的评估相悖，他们对俄罗斯军事领导人讨论可能在乌克兰使用战术核武器感到担忧。在9月底的一次讲话中，普京隐晦地提到了1945年美国向日本投下原子弹一事。
"Still, Mr. Wang appeared to want to encourage Russia to take steps that could ease international ill will that has spilled over to China. The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, declared a ""no limits"" partnership with Moscow early this year, weeks before Mr. Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine.","不过，王毅似乎希望鼓励俄罗斯采取措施，缓解已经波及到中国的国际敌意。中国领导人习近平今年年初宣布与莫斯科建立""没有止境""的伙伴关系，数周后普京发动了对乌克兰的入侵。"
"Mr. Wang said he welcomed Russia's agreement this month to allow Ukrainian grain exports to resume through the Black Sea. President Biden said that during his summit with Mr. Xi on Monday, they had agreed to oppose Russia's threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war.",王毅表示，俄罗斯本月同意，允许乌克兰通过黑海恢复粮食出口，他对此表示欢迎。拜登总统表示，在周一与习近平的峰会上，双方都同意反对俄罗斯在乌克兰战争中动用核威胁。
"But even with Mr. Putin's setbacks in Ukraine, China does not appear ready to walk away from Russia, which it sees as a vital strategic partner against the United States and its allies. Mr. Wang said that Beijing and Moscow should continue working together to ""promote a more multipolar world.""","然而，即便普京在乌克兰遭遇挫折，中国似乎也不准备疏远俄罗斯。中国将俄罗斯视为对抗美国及其盟友的重要战略伙伴。王毅说，北京和莫斯科应该继续合作，""坚定推进世界多极化进程""。"

It was unclear if there were any casualties.",据两名餐馆老板说——他们仅透露自己姓胡和姓赵，一些抗议者拆除了设置在小区外的围栏和路障。目前尚不清楚是否有人受伤。
"Many of the protesters were migrant workers from Hubei and its neighboring provinces working in Guangzhou's textile industry, said Mr. Hu as well as another restaurant owner, whose surname is Dai.",胡先生和另一名姓戴的餐馆老板说，许多抗议者是在广州的纺织行业打工的外来务工人员，主要来自湖北及其邻近省份。
"Videos circulating on social media showed an overturned police vehicle, ransacked food provisions and altercations between residents and health officials. Officers at a police station in Haizhu, reached by phone, said that they did not know about the incident.",社交媒体上流传的视频显示，一辆警车被推翻，食品供应被抢光，居民与卫生官员发生争执。海珠区一个派出所接听记者电话的民警说，他们不知道这件事。
"The police arrived a few hours later, said the four people, and the crowd soon dissipated.",接受采访的四人说，几个小时后警察来了，人群也很快散去。
"As of Wednesday, over a dozen neighborhoods in the area near Qiaonanxin Street remained under lockdown, and officials have not provided a date for lifting the order.",截至周三，桥南新街附近的十多个街道仍处于封控状态，官方尚未宣布解封日期。
"Guangzhou officials said that 95 percent of Covid cases found in the city on Monday were in the Haizhu district, according to a news conference on Tuesday. Food and other daily necessities had been distributed free of charge, and the supplies of fruits and vegetables have been increased on top of the original provisions, said Fu Xiaochu, a Haizhu district official.",广州官员在周二的新闻发布会上说，周一该市的新增感染病例中95%在海珠区。区官员傅晓初表示，政府已免费发放了食品和其他生活必需品，并在原有基础上增加了水果和蔬菜的供应。
"Huang Kunming, the Communist Party leader of Guangdong Province, of which Guangzhou is the capital, visited the city on Tuesday and urged health officials to ""win the battle"" of pandemic prevention.","广东省委书记黄坤明周二视察了海珠区，敦促卫生官员""打赢这场""疫情防疫战。"
The central government pledged last week to refine its Covid rules in an attempt to limit the disruption caused to people's lives and to reduce the strain on public health care. Officials relaxed China's quarantine period for inbound travelers to a minimum of five days from seven and said that contacts of contacts would no longer be tracked.,中央政府上周承诺优化新冠防控措施，减少民众生活受到的干扰，减轻公共卫生面临的压力。官方缩短了入境人员的集中隔离时间，从七天放宽至五天，并表示不再追踪次密接。
"But as case counts nationwide reached 19,609 on Wednesday, the highest daily total in over six months, how far the government may go in easing restrictions remains unclear. Investors rejoiced at the easing of quarantine rules that have been a major drag on the economy, but for most Chinese, the daily reality of having one's movements restricted has not changed.",但随着周三通报的全国新增感染病例达到20199例，系六个月来的最高数字，政府在放松限制上可能走多远仍不清楚。虽然投资者对政府放松了一直拖累经济的疫情防控规定表示欢迎，但对大多数中国人来说，日常行动受限的现实并没有改变。
"Nor has China's rhetoric. On Tuesday, days after some Covid rules were changed, the People's Daily, China's state newspaper, published an article with a familiar headline: To ""unswervingly implement the 'zero-Covid' policy.""","中国的官方说法也没有改变。在政府改变了一些新冠防控规定几天后，周二，官媒《人民日报》发表了一篇标题听起来很熟悉的文章:《坚定不移贯彻""动态清零""总方针》。"
"BALI, Indonesia After months of deepening contention between the United States and China, President Biden and President Xi Jinping met in person for the first time as national leaders on Monday with a tone of mutual engagement that acknowledged that both their countries faced challenges from global conflict and economic headwinds.",印度尼西亚巴厘岛——在美国和中国之间的争端加剧持续数月后，拜登总统和习近平主席于周一首次以国家领导人的身份举行面对面会晤，此番接触意味着双方都承认彼此面临着来自全球冲突和经济逆风的挑战。
"When their meeting began, they greeted each other like old companions. They agreed that neither wanted competition between their two superpowers to erupt in conflict. And after nearly three hours spent together, they promised more efforts to repair a relationship that has been at its most rancorous point in decades.",见面开始时，他们像老朋友一样互致问候。双方一致认为不希望两个超级大国之间的竞争爆发冲突。经过近三个小时的会晤后，他们承诺将付出更多努力来修复双边关系。双方目前处于几十年来最针锋相对的时刻。
"None of that hid the deeply divergent views behind their disagreements, including over the future of Taiwan, military rivalry, technology restrictions and China's mass detentions of its citizens. But with the stakes so high, both Mr. Biden's and Mr. Xi's language represented a choice not to gamble on unrestricted conflict but to bet that personal diplomacy and more than a decade of contacts could stave off worsening disputes.",这一切都无法掩盖矛盾背后的深刻分歧，包括台湾的未来、军事竞争、技术限制和中国对公民的大规模拘禁。但由于事关重大，拜登和习近平的措辞都表明，他们不会把赌注押在不受限制的冲突上，而是押注于个人外交和十多年的接触可以避免争端的恶化。
"""We're going to compete vigorously, but I'm not looking for conflict,"" Mr. Biden said at a news conference after the meeting. ""I'm looking to manage this competition responsibly.""","""我们将展开激烈竞争，但我不是在寻求冲突，""拜登在会后的新闻发布会上说。""我希望负责任地管理这场竞争。"""
"Mr. Xi said in his opening remarks, according to a summary issued by the Chinese government, ""As the leaders of these two great powers, China and the United States, we must play the role setting the direction of the rudder, and we should find the correct approach for developing bilateral relations.""","根据中国政府发布的会议纪要，习近平在开场白中说:""我们作为中美两个大国的领导人，要起到把舵定向的作用，应该为两国关系找到正确的发展方向。"""
"Both came to Bali for a meeting of the Group of 20 leaders after a moment of political success: Mr. Biden with better-than-expected results for Democrats in the midterm elections; Mr. Xi after securing a groundbreaking third term as Communist Party leader. But instead of swaggering into their meeting ready to contend over what Mr. Biden has called a struggle between democracy and autocracy, each appeared to agree that his national interests had been made vulnerable by the pandemic, climate change, the war in Ukraine and economic crisis.",在来到巴厘岛参加20国集团领导人会议之前，两人都在政治上取得了成功:拜登在中期选举中为民主党赢得了好于预期的结果;习近平获得了前所未有的第三个共产党领导人任期。但是，他们并没有在会议上摆出趾高气昂的架势，就拜登所说的民主与专制之间的斗争展开辩论，而是双方似乎都同意，他们的国家利益已因疫情、气候变化、乌克兰战争和经济危机而变得脆弱。
"""I absolutely believe there need not be a new Cold War,"" Mr. Biden said.","""我绝对相信，不需要再来一场冷战，""拜登说。"
"Both men appeared eager to downplay the idea that Washington and Beijing were careening toward confrontation, particularly over Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by China. Taiwan is the focus of a military and diplomatic pressure campaign by Beijing that has raised fears of a potential invasion. But Mr. Biden told reporters that he did not believe a Chinese invasion of Taiwan was ""imminent.""","两人似乎都急于淡化华盛顿和北京正在走向对抗的看法，尤其是在台湾问题上，中国声称对这个自治岛屿拥有主权。台湾是北京军事和外交施压行动的焦点，引发了台湾可能遭到入侵的担忧。但拜登告诉记者，他认为中国对台湾的入侵并非""迫在眉睫""。"
"And though both sides came and left without finding common ground on their most contentious disagreements ""I'm not suggesting this is Kumbaya,"" Mr. Biden said they found some accord. That included agreeing to reopen climate negotiations that had been frozen in recent months, a potential step forward in the effort to avert catastrophic global warming.","尽管双方经过会面仍没有在争议最大的分歧上找到共同点——""我并不是说皆大欢喜，""拜登说——但他们取得了一些共识。其中包括同意重启近几个月来暂停的气候谈判，这可能是避免灾难性全球变暖努力迈出的一步。"
The two pledged to renew efforts to have cabinet-level officials in Washington and their counterparts in Beijing meet more often. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken plans to visit China early next year to follow up.,两人承诺继续努力，让华盛顿的内阁级官员与北京对应官员更频繁地举行会面。国务卿布林肯计划跟进双方的会晤结果，于明年初访华。
"Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi, who have known each other for over a decade and last met in person at Davos in 2017, greeted each other warmly on the eve of the G20 gathering. (Mr. Biden, who often runs late, arrived early, as did Mr. Xi.) And Mr. Xi, who is often somber in high-stakes meetings, cracked a smile as a grinning Mr. Biden strode toward him with his hand outstretched.",拜登和习近平相识十多年，最后一次见面是在2017年的达沃斯。他们在G20峰会前热情地打招呼。(经常迟到的拜登和习近平一样提前到达。)当面带笑容的拜登大步走向习近平时，在重要会面中通常表情严肃的习近平露出了笑容。
"""Because of their solid personal relationship, there is reassurance in hearing directly from the other leader,"" said Daniel R. Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs who accompanied Mr. Biden on his meetings with Mr. Xi when Mr. Biden was vice president. Still, he said, ""there is no reason to think either leader will ease up on their respective priorities or begin to show new deference to the other's so-called core interests.""","""由于他们稳固的个人关系，直接听取另一位领导人的意见让人感到安心，""前助理国务卿丹尼尔·拉塞尔说，他在拜登担任副总统时负责东亚和太平洋事务，曾陪同拜登与习近平数次会面。尽管如此，他说，""没有理由认为任何一方会放松各自的优先事项，或者开始顺从对方所谓的核心利益。"""
"During their talks, Mr. Xi seemed to appeal to Mr. Biden to use his authority to rein in the distrust of China that pervades Washington these days.",在他们的会谈中，习近平似乎在呼吁拜登利用他的威信来控制近来华盛顿普遍存在的对中国的不信任。
"""China has never sought to alter the current international order, does not meddle in American domestic politics and has no intention of challenging and replacing the United States,"" Mr. Xi said in their talks.","""中国从来不寻求改变现有国际秩序，不干涉美国内政，无意挑战和取代美国，""习近平在会谈中说。"
But their cordial exchanges only marked the tentative start of any effort to resolve a host of thorny disputes.,但要付出努力解决一系列棘手的争端，他们的亲切交流仅标志着试探性的开始。
"""Both leaders went into the meeting seeking to buy time and take down the temperature, albeit for different reasons. They accomplished that,"" said Evan S. Medeiros, a Georgetown University professor who was President Barack Obama's top adviser on Asia-Pacific affairs. ""The real test of this meeting is not today, but in six to 12 months, when we see if problems were managed or worsen.""","""两位领导人参加会议都是想要争取时间、把温度降下来，尽管是出于不同的原因。他们做到了这一点，""乔治城大学教授麦艾文(Evan S. Medeiros)说，他曾是奥巴马总统的亚太事务高级顾问。""这次会议的真正考验不在今天，而是六到12个月后，届时我们将看到问题是得到控制还是恶化。"""
"As recently as last month, Mr. Biden's National Security Strategy cast China as a strategic rival with ""the intent to reshape the international order,"" while Mr. Xi warned of an increasingly perilous world in which unnamed foes implicitly, the United States and its allies aim to ""exert maximum pressure on China.""","就在上个月，拜登的国家安全战略将中国作为""有重塑国际秩序意图""的战略对手，而习近平则警告，在一个日益危险的世界中，没有指名道姓的敌人——暗指美国及其盟友——旨在对中国 ""极限施压""。"
The two leaders' comments on Taiwan revealed that it remained their most dangerous point of potential collision.,两位领导人在台湾问题上的言论表明，台湾仍然是他们最危险的潜在冲突点。
Chinese Communist Party leaders and many Chinese people adamantly believe that Taiwan is Chinese territory. Most people on Taiwan see themselves as a distinctive and proudly democratic society that could never survive under Chinese sovereignty.,中共领导人和许多中国人坚定地认为台湾是中国的领土。大多数台湾人则认为自己是一个独特的、让人自豪的民主社会，永远无法在中国的主权之下生存。
"Tensions have worsened in recent years under Mr. Xi's rule, as China's military strength has grown closer to the point where it could try to seize control of Taiwan by force, risking a confrontation with the United States.",近年来，在习近平的统治下，紧张局势出现恶化，因为中国的军力越来越接近于尝试用武力夺取台湾的控制权，从而有可能与美国发生对抗。
"Under an ambiguous ""one China"" policy, successive American presidents have said that they ""acknowledge"" Beijing's claim to Taiwan, but have not gone as far as endorsing or accepting that claim.","在模棱两可的""一个中国""政策下，历届美国总统都表示""承认""北京对台湾的主权主张，但并没有到认可或接受这一主张的程度。"
"Mr. Biden has taken a bolder stand on the issue than other recent presidents. He has said four times that the U.S. military will defend Taiwan if China attacks it, though other American officials insist that is not formal policy. Animosity between China and the United States over Taiwan ratcheted up after Speaker Nancy Pelosi's high-profile visit to the democratically governed island in August, which prompted days of intimidating Chinese military drills in the area.",拜登在这个问题上采取了比最近几任总统更大胆的立场。他曾四次表示，如果中国攻击台湾，美军将保卫台湾，但其他美国官员坚称这不是正式政策。美国众议院议长佩洛西今年8月高调访问台湾，促使中国在该地区举行了持续数天的恐吓性军事演习，中美两国在台湾问题上的敌意加剧。
"During their meeting on Monday, Mr. Biden said that he stood by the ""one China"" policy, but also warned Mr. Xi that China's aggressive stance toward the island threatened stability in the area and could, ultimately, jeopardize the global economy.","在周一的会晤中，拜登说，他坚持""一个中国""政策，但也警告习近平，中国对该岛的强硬立场威胁到该地区的稳定，最终可能危及全球经济。"
"Mr. Xi did not mince words, either, according to China's summary of the talks. Taiwan is ""the core of China's core interests, the foundation of political foundations in the China-U.S. relationship and a red line that cannot be crossed in the China-U.S. relationship,"" Mr. Xi said.","根据中方的会谈纪要，习近平也没有在言辞上示弱。台湾是 ""台湾问题是中国核心利益中的核心，是中美关系政治基础中的基础，是中美关系第一条不可逾越的红线""，他说。"
"While Mr. Xi's public comments on Taiwan were viscerally blunt, his responses to Mr. Biden's entreaties about the Russian invasion of Ukraine were more murky. Unlike the Biden administration's account of the talks, the summary from the Chinese delegation did not mention the leaders' agreeing on opposing threats by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Instead, according to the Chinese account, Mr. Xi said that ""a complicated issue does not have a simple solution,"" and that ""confrontation between major powers must be avoided.""","虽然习近平在台湾问题上的公开评论直截了当，但他对拜登在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰问题上发出的恳求做出了较为含糊的回应。与拜登政府对会谈的描述不同，中方的会谈纪要并没有提到两位领导人都反对俄罗斯总统普京对乌克兰的核武威胁。相反，根据中方的说法，习近平说，""复杂问题没有简单解决办法""，而且 ""大国对抗必须避免""。"
"When asked by a reporter about tensions over North Korea's nuclear program, Mr. Biden said he was not certain that China could contain that threat and that he had told Mr. Xi he must try to persuade the North Koreans not to engage in long-range nuclear tests.",当一位记者问及与朝鲜核计划有关的紧张局势时，拜登说，他不确定中国能否遏制这种威胁，他已告诉习近平，他必须努力说服朝鲜人不要进行远程核试验。
"""I'm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means,"" Mr. Biden said.","""我相信，中国不希望朝鲜采取进一步升级的手段，""拜登说。"
"Both sides needled the other over economic issues. Mr. Biden told Mr. Xi that the United States and China had to work together on debt relief, a reference to a push that administration officials have been making ahead of the G20 summit in hopes of avoiding a cascading global financial crisis. Several economic factors, including rising global interest rates, have left several countries unable to pay their debts. In many cases, China is the biggest creditor and has resisted any write-downs.",双方在经济问题上针锋相对。拜登告诉习近平，美中必须在债务减免方面进行合作，这指的是政府官员在20国集团峰会之前一直在推动的一项工作，希望能避免发生连环性的全球金融危机。全球利率上升等经济因素已使一些国家无力偿还债务。在许多情况下，中国是最大的债权人，它一直抵制任何债务减记。
"The Chinese delegation, in contrast, said in its summary that Mr. Xi had rebuked Mr. Biden for economic policies meant to boost American manufacturing at China's expense, including issuing rules meant to prevent China from buying and manufacturing some kinds of advanced semiconductors that can be used to deliver hypersonic missiles or potentially crack the U.S. military's most advanced codes.",相比之下，中方在会谈纪要中说，习近平指责拜登的经济政策旨在以中国为代价，促进美国制造业的发展，包括出台措施，阻止中国购买和制造某些种类的先进半导体，这些半导体可用于发射高超音速导弹或破解美国军队最先进的密码。
"The Chinese description of the meeting suggested that those policies and others meant to redirect American supply chains away from China ""completely violate the principles of market economy and undermine the rules of international trade.""","中方的会谈纪要称，这些政策和其他旨在将美国供应链从中国转移的政策""完全违反市场经济原则，破坏国际贸易规则""。"
"But neither leader went into the meeting expecting the other to concede on their major areas of disagreement. The point, they said, was to keep lines of communication open to prevent the relationship from devolving further.",但是，两位领导人在举行会晤时并不指望对方在主要分歧领域做出让步。他们说，关键是要保持沟通渠道的畅通，防止两国关系进一步恶化。
"""I think that we understand one another,"" Mr. Biden said, ""which is the most important thing that can be done.""","""我认为我们彼此理解，""拜登说，""这是我们能做的最重要的事情。"""
"The Hong Kong government on Monday demanded ""a full and in-depth investigation"" after a song associated with the pro-democracy protests of 2019 was played instead of the Chinese national anthem before a match by the city's rugby sevens team at a tournament in Incheon, South Korea.","香港七人榄球队在韩国仁川参加的一场比赛开始之前，球场播放了一首与2019年民主抗议活动相关的歌曲，而不是中国国歌。周一，香港政府要求展开""全面深入调查""。"
"On Sunday, as Hong Kong players stood shoulder-to-shoulder before a match against South Korea, the protest song ""Glory to Hong Kong"" blared through stadium speakers. Organizers were supposed to have played the anthem of the home countries of both teams. As a semiautonomous Chinese territory, Hong Kong shares China's national anthem, ""March of the Volunteers.""",周日，香港球员在对战韩国的比赛开始前并肩站立，这时体育场的扬声器中响起了抗议歌曲《愿荣光归香港》。组织者本应播放比赛双方的国歌。香港是半自治的中国领土，比赛本该播放中国国歌《义勇军进行曲》。
"Asia Rugby and the Korea Rugby Union extended joint apologies to the governments of Hong Kong and China. In a statement, Asia Rugby said that the mix-up resulted from a ""simple human error,"" when a junior member of the local organizing committee in South Korea played a song downloaded online rather than the anthem. The organizers said they removed the original footage of the match and replaced audio of the protest song with the Chinese anthem.","亚洲橄榄球总会和韩国橄榄球总会一起向香港和中国政府致歉。在一份声明中，亚洲橄榄球总会表示，混淆是由""单纯的人为错误""造成的，当时韩国当地组委会的一名初级工作人员播放了从网上下载的歌曲，而不是国歌。主办方表示，他们拿下了原始画面，并用正确的国歌替换了抗议歌曲的版本。"
"The Hong Kong Rugby Union on Monday said that it had raised the issue of the incorrect music, and that the Chinese anthem was played after Hong Kong won the match. ""Whilst we accept this was a case of human error, it was nevertheless not acceptable,"" the union said in a statement.","香港榄球总会周一表示，已提出了弄错歌曲的问题，在香港赢得比赛后，球场播放了正确的国歌。总会在一份声明中说:""虽然我们接受这是人为错误所致，但这个错误仍然是不可接受的。"""
"""Glory to Hong Kong"" became the unofficial anthem of the pro-democracy movement that paralyzed the city in 2019.",2019年的香港民主运动使该市陷入瘫痪，《愿荣光归香港》是那次运动的非官方颂歌。
"Composed by a local musician who has remained anonymous, the song became widely popular among pro-democracy protesters after it was first posted in August 2019 in an online forum. Hundreds of people gathered in shopping malls that autumn to belt out the lyrics. Brass bands and chamber orchestras played it live during protests and gatherings.",这首歌由一位至今仍然匿名的当地音乐家创作，于2019年8月首次在网络论坛上发布，此后在亲民主抗议者中广为传唱。那年秋天，经常有数以百计的民众聚集在商场里高唱此歌。铜管乐队和室内乐团在抗议和集会期间现场演奏此曲。
"But after a national security law was passed in 2020, ""Glory to Hong Kong"" mostly disappeared from public events. That year, education officials banned the song from schools and tasked school officials with stopping students from playing or singing it. The song includes the line ""Break now the dawn, liberate our Hong Kong in common breath: Revolution of our times!"" which references a protest slogan that the government said could be seditious.","但在2020年国家安全法通过后，《愿荣光归香港》已基本从公共活动中消失。那一年，教育官员禁止学校播放这首歌，并责成学校官员阻止学生演奏或演唱。歌中""黎明来到，要光复，这香港;同行儿女，为正义，时代革命!""这句歌词包含了政府所谓可能具有煽动性的抗议口号。"
"In 2020, Hong Kong had also passed a law that made disrespect for the Chinese anthem and flag a criminal offense. Before that, spectators had occasionally booed, turned their backs or made vulgar gestures when the Chinese anthem was played at sports events in the city.",2020年，香港还通过了一项法律，将不尊重国歌的行为定为刑事犯罪。在此之前，当香港的体育赛事奏响国歌时，观众偶尔会发出嘘声、转身或做出粗俗的手势。
"Last week, a Hong Kong woman was sentenced to three months in prison for insulting the official anthem. She had waved a British colonial flag last summer when hundreds of fans gathered in a Hong Kong shopping mall to watch the Tokyo Summer Olympics.",上周，一名香港女子因侮辱国歌罪被判处三个月监禁。去年夏天，当数百名观众聚集在香港一家购物中心观看东京夏季奥运会时，她挥舞着港英旗帜。
"As China's economy continues to be squeezed by the cost of the country's zero-tolerance approach to Covid, the government softened some of its restrictions on Friday, even as it remained committed to its strict pandemic policy.","尽管政府依然致力于严格的大流行防控政策，经济一直受制于新冠""清零""政策的中国在周五放宽了一些限制。"
"The shift, while modest, was enough to excite investors who have been searching for any sign that China was ready to ease its rules. The announcement sent Hong Kong's stock market soaring nearly 8 percent and buoyed mainland financial markets that have been in a depression over when China will abandon an approach many investors say has hurt the economy.",一些投资者一直在留意中国准备放宽限制的迹象，此次转变虽然幅度不大，但仍然让他们兴奋不已。放宽的消息使香港股市飙升近8%，也提振了内地金融市场。由于不知道中国何时将放弃在投资者看来损害经济的防控政策，内地金融市场此前一直陷入低迷。
"The move to narrow the scope of China's vast pandemic apparatus comes a day after its top leader, Xi Jinping, held a meeting with his newly appointed Politburo Standing Committee to discuss Covid-19 amid the economic uncertainty playing out in financial markets, in the boardrooms of the world's biggest companies and among global leaders.",这些举措缩小了中国庞大的流行病管控手段的范围，举措出台的前一天，中国最高领导人习近平与新任命的政治局常务委员会举行会议讨论了新冠疫情，目前金融市场正显露经济不确定性的影响，世界大型公司的董事会和全球领导者都感受到了这一点。
"Responding to the group's call to ""optimize"" and adjust a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to containing the virus, China's National Health Commission announced a flurry of changes on Friday. The moves appear to reflect a growing recognition at the highest levels that a more targeted approach is needed for controlling Covid-19.","周五，中国国家卫健委宣布了一系列变化，以响应会议关于""优化""和纠正以""一刀切""做法遏制病毒的号召。这些举措似乎反映了最高领导层越来越认识到需要采取更有针对性的方法来控制新冠病毒。"
"People entering China will now be required to quarantine in a hotel for five days followed by three days of isolation at home. Previously, visitors had to spend 10 days in quarantine, with seven of those in a hotel or government facility.",按照要求，现在入境中国需要在酒店隔离五天，然后居家隔离三天。以前，入境者必须度过10天隔离期，其中有七天是在酒店或政府的隔离机构。
"Officials also scrapped a penalty system for airlines bringing in travelers with Covid and reduced some of their more burdensome testing requirements, which effectively limited the number of people entering the country. Several Chinese travel platforms said searches for international flights surged on Friday.",官员们还取消了对带入感染新冠的旅客的航空公司实施的熔断制度，并减少了一些较为苛刻的核酸检测要求，这些要求有效地限制了入境人数。几家中国旅游平台表示，国际航班的搜索量在周五激增。
"Domestically, the government limited its contact tracing, part of a broader strategy of mass testing that has led to hundreds of millions of people being thrown into quarantine under heavy guard, provoking anger and discontent. It also got rid of other measures that had left many people stuck at home for weeks just because they lived in a neighborhood where a Covid case had been detected.",针对国内，政府限制了密接追踪的程度，密接追踪是更广泛的大规模检测战略的一部分，导致数亿人在严密戒备下被隔离，引发愤怒和不满。政府还取消了其他一些措施，这些措施曾让许多人仅仅因为居住的社区有新冠病例而被困在家中数周。
"Easing Covid policies could have big economic consequences. Shoppers have stayed away from malls, worried that they might cross paths even momentarily with someone infected and be sent to a long quarantine. Many stores and eateries have closed.",放宽新冠政策可能会产生重大的经济后果。购物者一直不光顾商场，担心可能会与感染者产生甚至只是一瞬间的时空交集，并被送去长期隔离。许多商店和餐馆都关门了。
"While the moves could lift parts of the Chinese economy, analysts cautioned that the changes were incremental and that the country's overall pandemic strategy remained onerous. China is the last major holdout to strict pandemic rules, and it remains unclear how and when Beijing will end its ""zero-Covid"" policies.","尽管这些举措可能会提振中国部分经济，但分析人士警告称，变化将是渐进式的，该国的总体大流行战略仍然严苛。中国是最后一个严格遵守大流行防控规定的大国，目前尚不清楚北京将如何以及何时结束其""清零""政策。"
"""This is no doubt an important rhetorical shift and may lay the groundwork for a move toward sustained gradual easing, but the market as it does is acting like 'zero-Covid' is over,"" said Taylor Loeb, a China analyst at Trivium, a consulting firm. ""That's just wrong. You don't unwind a nearly three-year top-level national policy overnight.""","""这无疑是一个重要的措辞转变，可能为迈向持续渐进地放宽政策奠定基础，但市场正在表现得好像'清零'已经结束，""策纬咨询公司的中国分析师泰勒·勒布说。""这是不对的。持续近三年的国家高层政策不会在一夜之间放松。"""
"The regulations are still in place, and local officials continue to heed messages from Mr. Xi, who has repeatedly praised the tough approach of ""putting people and their lives above all else"" and argued that the Communist Party had waged an ""all-out people's war to stop the spread of the virus."" Top officials reaffirmed the calls to double down on containing the virus on Thursday, urging ""firm strategic resolve"" in controlling the spread of the virus.","限制措施仍在实施，地方官员继续听取习近平传达的信息，他一再称赞""坚持人民至上、生命至上""的强硬路线，并辩称共产党发起了一场""抗击疫情的人民战争""。周四，高级官员重申了加大力度遏制病毒的呼吁，敦促在控制病毒传播方面""坚定战略决心""。"
"China reported more than 10,000 local cases on Thursday, its highest daily count in more than six months, putting to test a Covid strategy that is still largely focused on eliminating the virus.",周四，中国报告了1万多例本地病例，为六个多月以来的最高每日病例数，仍以病毒清零为重点的新冠策略面临考验。
"On Friday, long lines formed at Covid testing centers in Beijing as municipal officials required many residents to be tested daily, more frequently than in recent weeks. Citing pandemic restrictions, popular attractions in the area were also closed, including Lama Temple and two frequently visited tourist sites along the Great Wall.",周五，北京的新冠病毒检测中心排起了长队，因为市政官员要求许多居民每日检测，比最近几周更频繁。由于大流行的限制，该地区的热门景点也被关闭，包括雍和宫和长城上的两个热门旅游景点。
"""Some interpretations are being too optimistic,"" said Bruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle. ""The Covid policy will only be fine-tuned in the short term, with the focus shifting between eliminating cases and making more precise measures.""","""有些解读过于乐观，""仲量联行大中华区首席经济学家庞溟说。""新冠疫情政策只会在短期内进行微调，重点将在消除病例和制定更精确的措施之间转移。"""
"Foreign executives have complained about being unable to visit local staff and inspect operations for more than two years. Many would-be diners have preferred to stay home. The social costs are climbing, too, as more people are swept up in lengthy lockdowns and tough government quarantines, their frustrations evading China's internet censors.",两年多来，外国高管一直抱怨无法走访当地员工和检查运营。许多本应光顾餐馆的食客更愿意待在家里。社会成本也在攀升，因为越来越多的人陷入了漫长的封锁和严厉的政府隔离，中国的互联网审查也无法成功拦截他们的不满。
"Health officials said some of the adjustments to contact tracing were done to reduce the large number of people who had been caught up in the ""zero-Covid"" dragnet. Previously, even contacts of close contacts were identified and required to isolate.","卫生官员表示调整了密接追踪，以减少陷入拉网式""清零""的大量民众。以前，即使是密接的密接也被找出并要求隔离。"
"In the southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou, where cases have jumped to more 2,500 a day, the authorities had resisted a full-blown lockdown, choosing instead to restrict the movement of residents in three of the city's 11 districts. After the rule changes, they said at a news conference on Friday that they would release all close contacts currently under stay-at-home orders and would stop tracking new ones.",在南部制造业中心广州，每天的病例已跃升至2500多例，当局没有采取全面封锁，而是选择限制该市11个区中的三个区的居民流动。规则改变后，他们在周五的新闻发布会上表示，将目前处于居家令下的所有次密接者解除隔离，并停止追踪新的次密接。
"Top officials who met on Thursday called for a rectification of ""superfluous policy steps,"" in a nod to the growing social and economic cost of the country's increasingly rigid approach to controlling new variants that are milder, albeit more contagious.","新冠病毒新变体越来越温和但更具传染性，周四参会的高级官员呼吁纠正""层层加码""，以回应因防控方式日益严格所带来的不断增长的社会和经济成本。"
"But in a sign that China's leaders are not yet ready to abandon or deviate dramatically from their current strategies, they also stressed that ""necessary epidemic control measures must not be relaxed.""","但是，一个迹象表明，中国领导人还没有准备好放弃或大幅偏离当前的战略，他们还在强调""必要的防疫举措不能放松""。"
"China still has a long way to go before it makes any significant changes to its pandemic status quo, longtime China observers like Mr. Loeb argued.",像勒布这样的资深中国观察人士认为，中国在对大流行现状做出任何重大改变之前还有很长的路要走。
"""I'll believe it,"" he said, ""when I see it.""","他说:""我要亲眼看到才会相信。"""
"For years, China's annual shopping extravaganza known as Singles Day looked like a profitable exchange between East and West. Thousands of premium Western brands like Apple and L'Oreal were bought by hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers on the e-commerce giant Alibaba.","多年来，中国一年一度的""双11""购物节看起来曾像是一种东西方均可牟利的交流。几亿中国消费者在电子商务巨头阿里巴巴的平台上购买苹果和欧莱雅等上千种高端西方品牌。"
"As Xi Jinping pushes China to become more economically self-sufficient, Singles Day is adjusting to a more insular era, one built on the strength of domestic companies with close scrutiny, and support, from the Chinese Communist Party.","随着习近平推动中国在经济上更自立，""双11""正在适应一个更为封闭的时代，这个时代建立在受到中共密切关注和支持的国内企业力量之上。"
"Singles Day started as a one-day event on Nov. 11 but, like Black Friday, has morphed into a weekslong affair. This year's event started in late October, and Chinese businesses have clinched the top-selling spots in several categories, including cosmetics, fashion and home appliances.","""双11""购物节起初是11月11日这一天的活动，但与黑色星期五一样，它已演变成持续数周的活动。今年从10月下旬就开始了，中国品牌在化妆品、时装和家电等多个商品类型中占据了最畅销地位。"
"While L'Oreal, Nike and other foreign companies retained a strong presence, they shared the spotlight with their Chinese rivals, which accounted for over half of the top 100 selling brands in the first hour of sales on Alibaba's main shopping platform, Tmall, according to the state media outlet, Xinhua.","虽然欧莱雅、耐克和其他外国品牌在中国市场保持了强大影响力，但它们与中国竞争对手平分秋色，据官媒新华社报道，在阿里巴巴的主要购物平台天猫的""双11""头一个小时里，中国品牌在销售额排名前100的品牌中占到一半以上。"
"Winona, a top-selling skin-care brand from Yunnan Province, is selling moisturizing creams and hydrating serums formulated and priced specifically for Chinese buyers. Bosideng, a luxury parka brand, lists goose-feather down jackets that have been given as gifts by Beijing to foreign leaders. Anta, a competitor to Nike and Adidas, is promoting shoes worn by Eileen Gu, the freestyle skier who won multiple medals for China at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.",最畅销护肤品牌是来自云南的薇诺娜，它销售的是专为中国消费者研制、定价的保湿霜和保湿精华液。奢侈派克大衣品牌波司登宣称它的鹅毛羽绒服是中国政府送给外国领导人的礼物。耐克和阿迪达斯的竞争对手安踏在推销自由滑雪运动员谷爱凌穿过的鞋子，她曾在2022年北京冬奥会上为中国赢得多枚奖牌。
"""Chinese brands are on fire,"" said Sherry Liu, a project manager at a Beijing technology company, who said the pandemic and state policies had made Singles Day ""more Chinese."" Her shopping cart this year included sneakers from Anta and face creams from Proya, a Chinese cosmetics brand.","北京一家科技公司的项目经理雪莉·刘表示，""中国品牌火了。""她表示，新冠疫情和国家政策让""双11更中国""。刘女士今年购买的商品包括安踏运动鞋和中国化妆品品牌珀莱雅的面霜。"
"The rise of homegrown favorites in recent years can be traced in part to Mr. Xi's guiding hand. Since China's borders shut in 2020, he has pushed domestic demand to be a major engine of economic growth. China's recent five-year-plan resolved to ""enhance the influence and competitiveness of domestic brands,"" from high-end technology like semiconductors to everyday categories like fashion.","本土商品近年来越来越受欢迎的部分原因可追溯到习近平的引导。自从中国2020年关闭边境以来，习近平一直在推动内需成为经济增长的主要引擎。中国最近的五年计划决定，从半导体等高端技术到时装等日常用品，""提升自主品牌影响力和竞争力""。"
"Chinese companies, too, have evolved, with their quality rising and their popularity surging. Homegrown brands are often better equipped to address the needs of domestic consumers and adapt to a country's shifting trends.",中国企业也在不断发展，质量不断提高，品牌受欢迎度飙升。本土品牌往往能够更好地满足国内消费者的需求，适应中国不断变化的趋势。
"""Chinese, especially Chinese Gen Z's, they're now growing more accepting and supportive of Chinese-made products,"" said Yuwan Hu, a manager at Daxue Consulting, a research firm analyzing Chinese market trends.",""" 中国人，特别是GenZ，对中国生产的产品的看法或者接受程度在不断的上升，""分析中国市场趋势的研究公司博圣轩投资顾问有限公司的经理胡钰琬说。"
"First promoted by Alibaba in 2009, Singles Day was designed as a consumerist bash built to harness the power of the Chinese consumer for the world. The company threw big galas to drum up interest, flying in stars like Mariah Carey and Taylor Swift to perform. As billions of dollars changed hands, the total was tallied on a mammoth screen projection that ticked inexorably upward.","阿里巴巴2009年首次推出的""双11""曾是一个能让全世界利用中国消费者力量的消费主义狂欢活动。为了吸引人们的兴趣，阿里举办盛大晚会，邀请玛丽亚·凯莉和泰勒·斯威夫特等明星来中国表演。随着销售额达到上百亿，舞台的巨大屏幕上显示着不停翻新的数字。"
"Then Beijing put a damper on the party. In April, regulators fined Alibaba $2.8 billion for anticompetitive practices during a sweeping technology crackdown. Businesses have since reassessed their marketing for large, attention-grabbing activities. Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma, the showman who previously presided over Singles Day, has been notably low key over the past two years.","后来，中国政府给这场盛会泼了冷水。今年4月，在一次全面打击科技企业的行动中，监管机构对阿里巴巴的反竞争行为开出了182亿元的罚单。那之后，企业对引人注目的大型促销活动进行了重新评估。阿里巴巴爱出风头的创始人马云以前曾主持过""双11""盛大表演，他在过去两年里一直非常低调。"
"""This year it's been really quiet,"" Tian Hou, the founder of TH Data Capital, a Beijing-based data analytics company, said about Singles Day promotions. Now, the tech companies ""don't want to be too up in the authorities' faces.""","""今年真的很安静，""总部位于北京的数据分析公司天灏资本的创始人侯晓天谈到""双11""促销活动时说。现在，科技企业""都不想在当局面前表现得太过分""。"
"As the gospel of all-out consumption fades, it has been supplanted by themes such as green consumption, rural revitalization and ""inclusive economic development"" all priorities of Mr. Xi.","随着鼓吹竭力消费的声音变小，绿色消费、乡村振兴、""包容性经济发展""等主题正在取而代之，这些都是习近平的优先事项。"
"Bosideng, a top seller in women's fashion, was founded in 1976 by a group of people in rural villages with hand-held sewing machines. In the 2000s, as part of a bid to support domestic businesses, China's leaders latched on to the brand, handing out its down jackets to foreign heads of state, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.",女装类别的热销品牌波司登是一群农村人在1976年创立的，他们当时用的是脚踏缝纫机。在本世纪的头十年，中国领导人为支持国内企业，看上了这个品牌，将它生产的羽绒服送给了包括俄罗斯总统普京在内的外国国家元首。
"The company got another boost in 2015 when Beijing was selected to host the 2022 Winter Olympics and Mr. Xi set off to build China into a winter sports power. In the years leading up to the games, Bosideng's revenues nearly doubled, as the country raced to build ice rinks and ski resorts.",2015年，中国被选为2022年冬季奥运会主办国，习近平打算将中国变成冬季运动强国后，波司登再获助推。在冬奥会开始前的几年里，随着中国各地竞相建设溜冰场和滑雪场，波司登的营收几乎翻了一番。
"While Bosideng's fortunes have risen, a major Western competitor, Canada Goose, has been mired in political turmoil in China. After the 2018 arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Vancouver, British Columbia, triggered a diplomat spat between Beijing and Ottawa, many Chinese took to social media to boycott the Canadian parkas. Last year, the brand was fined $88,000 for violating Chinese advertising laws.",就在波司登好运连绵的时候，一个主要的西方竞争对手——加拿大鹅却深陷中国的政治漩涡。2018年，一名中国科技企业的高管在不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华被捕后，引发了中国与加拿大的外交战，许多中国人到社交媒体上表示，要抵制加拿大的派克大衣。去年，加拿大鹅因违反中国广告法被处罚了45万元。
"""Foreign brands don't necessarily represent high quality,"" read a commentary in Economic Daily, a state-affiliated newspaper, after the fine. ""The foreign moon is not rounder, and the foreign down jacket is not warmer.""","""洋品牌不一定代表高质量，""官方报纸《经济日报》在一篇评论上述处罚的文章中写道。""外国的月亮没有更圆，外国的羽绒服也没有更暖。"""
"In the second quarter that ended Oct. 2, Canada Goose logged a 4 percent sales decline from a year earlier in its Asia-Pacific market because of disruptions related to Covid. The company said that it faced ""temporary headwinds"" in China, but that its sales in the country had risen in recent weeks and that it planned to invest in the region for the long term.","在截至今年10月2日的第二季度，受新冠疫情影响，加拿大鹅在亚太市场的销售额同比下降了4%。公司说，虽然在中国面临""暂时的逆风""，但公司在中国的销售额最近几周有所上升，公司计划在该地区进行长期投资。"
"As political skirmishes befall more Western competitors, some Chinese brands have been showing their national allegiance.",随着越来越多的西方竞争对手遭受政治冲突的厄运，一些中国品牌已在展示对国家的忠诚。
"Anta came to prominence after Kong Linghui wore the company's shoes on his way to winning the gold in table tennis, China's national obsession, at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Since then, hundreds of top Chinese athletes have worn Anta gear, and the company is now worth $28 billion.",在2000年的澳大利亚悉尼奥运会上，穿着安踏鞋的孔令辉赢得了乒乓球冠军后，该品牌声名鹊起。从那时起，数百名中国顶级运动员穿的都是安踏的鞋和服装，公司目前市值已达280亿美元。
"Anta has capitalized on rising nationalist sentiment. In March 2021, brands like Nike and Adidas faced boycotts from Chinese consumers and celebrities after issuing statements against the use of cotton from the Xinjiang region, over concerns of forced labor. Anta took the opposite tack, pulling out of a global sustainable-cotton group that had retracted licenses to Xinjiang farms and announcing that it would continue to source cotton from the region.",安踏利用了日益高涨的民族主义情绪。2021年3月，耐克和阿迪达斯等品牌遭到了中国消费者和名人的抵制，因为这些公司担心新疆存在强迫劳动，发表了不使用新疆棉的声明。安踏采取了相反的做法，因良好棉花发展协会暂停在新疆发放棉花许可证退出了该机构，并宣布将继续从新疆采购棉花。
"After Russia invaded Ukraine this year, Nike and Adidas left Russia. Anta remained. Research from Yale University categorized the shoemaker's reaction as ""digging in.""","今年，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，耐克和阿迪达斯退出了俄罗斯市场，安踏留了下来。耶鲁大学的案例研究将安踏的反应归类为""深入挖掘""。"
"In recent quarters, Adidas's sales in China have dropped, while Anta's have surged. This year, Anta was the No. 2 seller of athletic shoes, while Adidas was No. 6 in initial sales rankings for Singles Day.","最近几个季度，阿迪达斯在中国的销售额已有所下降，而安踏的销售额却在飙升。今年，安踏已是中国运动鞋销量的第二大卖家，而阿迪达斯在""双11""促销开始时的销售额排名中排第六。"
Anta did not respond to a request for comment.,安踏没有回复记者的置评请求。
"As the geopolitical terrain and consumer demands shift, Chinese brands are gaining a distinct edge, said Ashley Dudarenok, founder of Alarice and ChoZan, a marketing agency in Hong Kong whose clients include Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson.","随着地缘政治形势和消费者需求的改变，中国品牌正在获得明显优势，""Alarice与ChoZan""的创始人艾熙丽(Ashley Dudarenok)说。这家总部设在香港的营销公司的客户包括可口可乐和强生。"

"After starting in 2008, the skin-care company Winona conducted surveys to determine what products would best sell in China. Many Chinese, the surveys found, identified as having sensitive skin. When the company started its shop on Alibaba's Tmall in 2012, it promoted a specifically designed moisturizer for Chinese consumers.",成立于2008年的护肤品公司薇诺娜为确定哪些产品在中国最畅销进行了调查。结果发现，许多中国人认为自己有敏感的皮肤。2012年，薇诺娜在阿里巴巴的天猫开店时，推出了一款专门为中国消费者设计的润肤霜。
"Zhao Han, a sales manager at a Shanghai tourism company, used to travel to Japan to buy duty-free skin-care products from Shu Uemura and Shiseido, both Japanese brands. But when China shut its borders during the pandemic, she found Winona an attractive alternative.",上海一家旅游公司的销售经理赵涵(音)以前经常去日本购买植村秀和资生堂这两个日本品牌的免税护肤品。但中国在疫情期间关闭了边境后，她发现薇诺娜是一个有吸引力的替代选择。
"""Why should I pay three times as much for expensive foreign goods?"" Ms. Zhao, 28, asked. She said 70 percent of the products she had bought in this year's Singles Day sales were domestic brands.","""为什么我要为昂贵的外国商品花三倍的钱?""现年28岁的赵女士问道。她说，她在今年的""双11""购物节买的产品中有 70%是国产品牌。"
"As Winona and other domestic cosmetics brands surged last year, sales of top foreign competitors, such as Lancome and L'Oreal, suffered. This year, during a livestream by the popular social media influencer Li Jiaqi, Winona sold more than 1 billion yuan (more than $137 million) of face creams and other products in just a few hours, Chinese state media reported.",去年，随着薇诺娜和其他国内化妆品品牌销售额的飙升，兰蔻和欧莱雅等外国主要竞争对手的销售额受到影响。据中国官媒报道，今年，在高人气的社交媒体影响者李佳琦的直播中，薇诺娜在短短几个小时内卖出了逾10亿元人民币的面霜和其他产品。
Winona did not reply to a request for comment.,薇诺娜没有回复记者的置评请求。
"Some brands have leaned more explicitly into Chinese culture, a reaction to broader state-backed efforts to strengthen cultural heritage and tradition. Chicecream sold ice cream in the shape of Chinese roof tiles, and Florasis created makeup kits embossed with art that resembles Chinese landscape paintings.",一些品牌已经在更明确地使用中国文化，这是对政府支持加强文化遗产和传统的更广泛努力的反应。钟薛高销售中国屋顶瓦片形状的冰淇淋，花西子创造了包装盒上有类似中国山水画的凸起图案的化妆品。
"When Rao Yong, 36, opened an online store selling traditional Chinese handicrafts in 2014, he considered it a hobby. Over time, as the party promoted the importance of Chinese culture, it grew into a full-fledged business.",现年36岁的饶勇在2014年开设了一家销售中国传统手工艺品的网店，那时他曾将其视为一种爱好。随着中共宣扬中国文化的重要性，近年来，他的网店已成长为一个成熟的企业。
"""Chinese culture itself is extraordinary, but in the past, people may have chosen to ignore it,"" he said.",""" 我们中国文化本身就很了不起吗，只不过就在以前的话，可能大家会忽略了它，""他说。"
"Mr. Rao draws roughly 5 percent of his revenues from Singles Day. His business this year has taken a hit from China's lockdowns, but he is optimistic.","饶先生大约5%的营收来自""双11""。虽然今年的生意受到了中国封控的打击，但他仍然乐观。"
"""As the economy improves people will care more and more about their own national culture,"" he added. ""That direction is inevitable.""","""因为随着我们经济水平的提高，必然对自己本身的民族文化会越来越重视，""他补充说。""这是一个必然的方向。"""
It is the great economic guessing game about China: When will the Chinese government ditch its zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19?,"中国经济有个最让人捉摸不定的问题，那就是，中国政府什么时候会放弃""新冠清零""政策?"
"Companies and manufacturers are worrying about their profits, while uncertainty is rippling through financial markets. Global leaders and policymakers are sizing up Beijing's moves as part of their own growth calculations, given China's central role in the global economy.",企业和制造商们都在为利润担心，同时，不确定性也在向金融市场扩散。考虑到中国在全球经济中的核心作用，世界其他地方的领导人和政策制定者正在把中国政府的举动作为他们国家经济增长考量的一部分。
"The answer comes down to one man the country's top leader, Xi Jinping. His word is all the more sacrosanct since securing a precedent-defying third term at the Communist Party's congress late last month, where he stacked his leadership with loyalists and set out an agenda that shook global assumptions about the trajectory of the world's second-largest economy.",这个问题的答案取决于一个人，即中国最高领导人习近平。在上个月中旬召开的中共二十大上，习近平打破常规获得了最高领导人第三个任期后，他的话变得更加神圣不容质疑。他在二十大上把自己的亲信安排进最高领导层，并制定议程，动摇了全球关于世界第二大经济体将何去何从的假设。
"The lack of visibility into his thinking has left the world trying to divine whether even the smallest signals could indicate the government is fine-tuning its ""zero-Covid"" policy to limit the harm to the economy. After the congress, China's financial markets took a dramatic plunge over concerns about Mr. Xi's power play. Shortly thereafter, speculation about loosening Covid restrictions sent them soaring.","由于对习近平的想法缺乏了解，全世界都在左猜右想，哪怕是最小的信号，是否也能表明政府正在微调""新冠清零""政策，以减少对经济的伤害。二十大闭幕后，出于对习近平强权政治的担忧，中国金融市场出现暴跌。此后不久，有关放松新冠限制措施的猜测曾推动股价飙升。"
"Each day seems to bring new disparate data points for the markets to digest. Low-level health officials urge less drastic enforcement of existing measures, while top officials repeat that they are staying the course.",金融市场似乎每天都有迥然不同的新数据需要消化。低级别卫生官员呼吁降低现行措施的夸张执行力度，高级别官员则重申把清零坚持到底。
"The authorities are facing a dilemma. Nationwide, daily cases are at a six-month high, with China reporting more than 8,100 new infections per day. Under the usual playbook, officials are resorting to more lengthy lockdowns and costly mass testing to try to stop the spread.",当局正面临着一个两难选择。全国范围内，日新增确诊病例达到六个月来的新高，每天通报的新增感染已超过8100例。按照清零策略的要求，官员们正在诉诸于更长时间的封控和耗资巨大的大规模核酸检测，试图阻止病毒传播。
"And in China, nothing will be certain until Mr. Xi stops trumpeting ""zero Covid"" or clearly articulates that the country is changing direction.","除非习近平停止宣扬""新冠清零""，或明确表示国家正在改变方向，否则一切都将无法确定。"
"In a world beset by war in Ukraine, skyrocketing inflation and rising fears of a global recession, China could have been a bright spot for growth. While most countries dealt with widespread infections and mass deaths in the first year of the pandemic, China kept the virus largely in check with snap lockdowns and quarantines, and its economy thrived relative to the rest of the world.",在一个被乌克兰战争、飙升的通货膨胀以及日益加剧的全球经济衰退威胁困扰的世界，中国本可以成为经济增长的一个亮点。在新冠病毒大流行的第一年，当大多数国家都出现了感染病例激增和大规模死亡时，中国依靠及时封控和集中隔离等做法，在很大程度上遏制了病毒传播，与世界其他地方相比，中国的经济也恢复得更快。
"As new Covid variants have proven milder and vaccines have become more widespread, the rest of the world has moved on from strict policies. China has stuck to the same heavy-handed approach, concerned that a large number of deaths could come with a policy change, and reluctant to import more potent foreign vaccines.",随着新变异株被证明比较温和，新冠疫苗的接种范围越来越广，世界其他地方已不再实行严格的疾控政策。中国却一直坚持使用同样的高压手法，它担心如果改变政策，可能会带来大量死亡，并且不愿进口效力更强的外国疫苗。
"With each new outbreak and infectious strain of Covid-19, the uncertainty grows over how and when Mr. Xi will dismantle his pandemic policy.",随着每轮新疫情的暴发，以及更具感染性的新变异株的出现，让习近平会不会取消、何时取消他的大流行疾控政策的不确定性增加。
"""China has this boot on the neck of economic activity, and we're past the point where the boot made sense,"" said Jude Blanchette, an expert on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"Easing Covid policy matters for the economy. People are staying home, fearful that they might cross paths with someone infected and be sent to a long quarantine under heavy guard. China continues to isolate not just those sick with Covid but anyone who has come in contact with them. Many stores and eateries have closed.",放松防疫政策对经济影响重大。人们呆在家里，因为担心出门可能会接触感染者，导致自己被送进戒备森严的集中隔离设施，接受长时间隔离。中国不仅继续隔离感染新冠病毒的人，也继续隔离与感染者有过接触的人。许多商店和餐馆已经关闭。
"The world's largest iPhone manufacturing complex in the north-central Chinese city of Zhengzhou went into a lockdown in mid-October and again this month. Some employees fled the 200,000-worker facility with stories of food shortages flooding the internet. Apple this week warned that its sales would be short of expectations because of the drastic measures.",位于郑州全球最大的iPhone制造园区曾在10月中旬实行封控，本月再次进入封控状态。该园区有20万名工人，其中一些已逃离工厂，网上大量流传着园区食品短缺的说法。苹果本周警告，受这些严格措施的影响，公司的销售额将低于预期。
"The warning, and China's latest Covid situation, was described by one analyst as ""an absolute gut punch"" for the company ahead of the most important holiday season.","按照一名分析师的说法，苹果的警告以及中国最近的疫情形势是对这家公司在最重要的节日季节到来前的""致命一击""。的""致命一击""。"
"The Chinese financial markets, at times, appear disconnected from reality. Investors hoping for a change in policy are pouncing on any information, often rumors or thinly sourced reports, sending the markets on a roller coaster ride.",中国的金融市场有时似乎与现实脱节。希望政府改变政策的投资者抓住所有的信息(通常是谣言或消息来源不可靠的报道)做交易，这让股市坐上了过山车。
"Rosy reports from Wall Street banks, pointing to the opportunity for rewards when China opens up, have also helped to fuel rallies. A report from Goldman Sachs this week predicted Chinese stocks could jump by 20 percent ""on (and before) reopening"" from the pandemic.","华尔街银行的乐观报告只提中国开放后的赚钱机会，也助长了股市的增势。高盛在本周的一份报告里预测，中国股市可能会在大流行后""重新开放时(和之前)""上涨20%。"
"Often, investors are seizing on official signals, even if the Chinese government isn't actually revealing much. At a news conference last Saturday in Beijing, for example, senior health officials declared that they were ""unswervingly"" committed to zero-Covid policies, but within reason.","通常情况下，投资者会抓住官方信号的机会，即使中国政府实际上并不透露多少信息。例如，卫健委高级官员上周六在北京举行的新闻发布会上宣布，他们将坚持新冠清零政策""不动摇""，但政策执行要在合理范围内。"
"While much of the country remains committed to the zero-Covid strategy, there are signs that the approach is reaching its limit. The financial pressures are mounting on local governments that are running out of money to pay for Covid control measures like mass testing. The social costs, too, are amplifying as more and more people are caught in lengthy lockdowns, their anger, frustration and discontent slipping through internet censors.",虽然中国大部分地区仍在坚持新冠清零的做法，但有迹象表明，这种做法正在达到极限。地方政府的财政压力越来越大，它们已没钱支付大规模核酸检测等新冠防控措施的费用。新冠清零的社会成本也在不断放大，由于越来越多的人遭受长时间的封控，中国的互联网审查已无法抑制他们的愤怒、沮丧和不满。
"Authorities have quietly responded to some of the excesses, including reining in neighborhood guards who resort to violence to enforce the restrictions. Police in a Shandong Province community announced on Tuesday that seven guards there had been detained for beating and dragging people, in a statement that quickly went viral on the Chinese internet and was not censored.",当局已悄悄地对一些过度做法进行了回应，包括对使用暴力执行限制措施的社区保安进行处罚。周二，山东一个社区的警方宣布，七名保安因殴打和拖拽他人被拘留。这份声明迅速在中国互联网上疯传，而且没被审查。
Officials are also offering tiny hints that they might consider a new approach if medical advances could ease the pressure on China's health care system.,官员们也在做出微小的暗示，如果医学上的进展能缓解中国医疗体系压力的话，他们可能会考虑采取新的做法。
"The city of Shanghai recently began offering a new inhaled Covid-19 vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical group CanSino Biologics, which officials have said could significantly enhance immunity and appeal to a portion of the population still hesitant to vaccines. More than a dozen cities are expected to offer the vaccine soon.",上海最近开始提供一种由中国制药集团康西诺生物研发的新型吸入式新冠疫苗。官员们说，这种疫苗可以显著提高免疫力，并对一部分仍在接种疫苗上犹豫的人群有吸引力。预计不久将有十多个城市会提供这种疫苗。
"Two Chinese pharmaceutical companies are close to gaining approval on mRNA vaccines based on technology first developed and approved in the United States. China has also made progress in drafting distribution agreements with foreign drug companies, and developing and acquiring Covid treatments, including a homegrown antiviral pill.",两家中国制药公司的mRNA疫苗已接近获得批准，这种技术是美国率先研发、批准的。中国还在与外国制药公司起草分销协议，以及研发和收购新冠疾病治疗方面取得进展，其中包括一种国产抗病毒药物。
"Citing such developments, Zeng Guang, a former chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told investors last week that the conditions for China to open up and loosen its policy were improving. His comments, made at a private investor event held by Citigroup, spread quickly online and prompted a rise in financial markets. A spokesperson for Citi declined to comment.",中国疾病预防控制中心流行病学前首席科学家曾光上周以上述进展为例，对投资者说，中国开放和放松疾控政策的条件正在改善。曾光是在花旗集团举办的私人投资者活动上说这番话的。他的话很快在网上迅速传播，引发金融市场上涨。花旗的发言人拒绝对此置评。
"For investors, it is hard to tell whether these small signals will translate into a broader easing of Covid controls, said Richard Harris, the chief executive of Port Shelter Investment Management in Hong Kong.",香港Port Shelter投资管理公司首席执行官理查德·哈里斯(Richard Harris)表示，对投资者来说，很难判断这些小信号是否会转化为更大范围的放松。

Many investors are sitting on the sidelines waiting for more concrete evidence.,许多投资者都在观望，等待更多具体证据的出现。
"Winston Feng, the portfolio manager at MassAve Global, said he was looking at how authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou are handling a sudden spike in cases in recent days. Last year, officials responded to relatively few cases with severe restrictions on people's movements, sending robotic trucks with food into districts under lockdown. This time around, he said, officials have launched mass testing requirements but so far have avoided a citywide lockdown.",寰球资本的投资组合经理温斯顿·冯说，他正在关注广州有关部门最近几天如何处理感染病例突然激增的问题。去年，官员们在只出现了相对较少确诊病例后采取的应对做法是，严格限制人们的行动，用自动驾驶的卡车将食品送进被封控的社区。冯先生说，这次，虽然官员们宣布了大规模核酸检测的要求，但迄今为止尚未采取全市范围的封控措施。
"""The nuance here is how much of that experimentation is now being conducted,"" Mr. Feng said, adding that he expected China to take small measures to reopen but also impose renewed restrictions if needed to bring local outbreaks under control.","""这里的细微差别在于，正在进行多少这种试验，""冯先生说道。他预计，中国将在重新开放上采取小步骤，但如果需要，也会实施新的限制措施，以控制地方层面的疫情。"

"For decades, China's business class had an unspoken contract with the Communist Party: Let us make money and we'll turn a blind eye to how you use your power.",几十年来，中国的工商阶层与中共曾有过一个心照不宣的约定:你让我们赚钱，我们就对你如何使用权力睁一只眼闭一只眼。
"Like most Chinese people, they bought into the party's argument that its one-party rule provides more efficient governance.",他们和大多数中国人一样信从了中共的说法，那就是中共的一党专政让治理更有效。
"Now, the tacit agreement that entrepreneurs had come to count on is dissolving in front of their eyes. China's leader, Xi Jinping, used an important Communist Party congress last month to establish near-absolute power and make it clear that security would trump the economy as the nation's priority.",现在，企业家们曾依赖的这个默契正在他们的眼前化为泡影。中国领导人习近平在中共上个月召开的重要会议上获得了近乎绝对的权力，他已明确表示，国家安全是置于经济之上的首要事项。
"""My last lingering hope was dashed,"" said the founder of an asset management firm in the southern city of Shenzhen who contacted me hours after the congress ended.","""今天把我仅存的一点小小的希望熄灭掉了，""南方城市深圳一家资产管理公司的创始人在二十大结束几个小时后联系我说。"

"Like many Chinese, they fully expected Mr. Xi to secure a third term, breaking a norm followed since the 1980s. Still, they held onto the hope that his dominance would be tempered by other power factions within the party. Mr. Xi's sweeping victory, by pushing out perceived moderates in favor of loyalists, made it clear that it would be a one-man rule system that could last for decades.",他们与许多中国人一样，完全预料到习近平能获得第三个任期，虽然这打破了20世纪80年代以来的惯例，但他们对习近平的统治地位会受到党内其他权力派系的约束仍抱有希望。习近平在二十大上把领导层中被外界视为温和派的人全部换成了自己的亲信，他的全面胜利已清楚地表明，其独揽大权的局面可能会持续几十年。
"China's last leader as powerful as Mr. Xi, 69, was Mao Zedong, who led the country into the Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution that resulted in tens of millions of deaths, social chaos and economic destruction.",习近平现年69岁，中国上一个权力如此之大的领导人是毛泽东，他领导下的中国发生了大饥荒和文化大革命，导致数千万人死亡、社会混乱和经济崩溃。
"Last month's party congress jolted the Chinese business world with uncertainty. It was seen publicly in the immediate market response: China's stocks plunged and its currency, the yuan, fell in value. I am hearing it in the voices and messages of the many businesspeople I have spoken to in recent weeks who repeatedly call their reaction a ""political depression.""","上个月召开的二十大给中国商界带来了不确定性。从市场的直接反应就能直接看出这一点:中国股市暴跌，人民币贬值。从最近几周与我交流的许多商界人士的言论和短信中，我感受到了这种不确定性，他们反复用""政治抑郁""一词来描述他们对二十大的反应。"
"They are not displaying their anxiety in public, unlike a young demonstrator I wrote about in my last column. All the businesspeople I interviewed for this article requested anonymity for fear of punishment by the authorities. But they are expressing dissent in their own way, pledging to withhold further investment in China or even contemplating leaving their country for another that would exchange a passport for their wealth.",他们不像我上一篇文章里写过的那些年轻抗议者，公开展示自己的焦虑。由于担心受到当局惩罚，我为本文采访的所有商界人士都要求不具名。但他们正在以自己的方式表达不同意见，发誓不再在中国进行更多投资，甚至考虑去其他国家，比如那些可以用钱买到护照的国家。
"The party, under Mr. Xi, has taken control of nearly every aspect of society, costing Chinese people agency over their destinies. Members of the business class, especially those working at the top of the technology sector who operated with relatively few restrictions until a few years ago, have taken it especially hard.",在习近平的领导下，中共已经几乎控制了社会的所有方面，使中国人失去了掌握自身命运的主动权。工商阶层的人士，尤其是那些直到几年前仍受到相对较少的限制、在科技领域高层工作的人，更难接受这种现实。
"These tech entrepreneurs mostly grew up ""in the age of 'economism,' when money making, economic principles and economic rationality trumped everything else,"" said Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. ""Now they see the regime puts politics in command,"" he said. ""For them, this is incomprehensible.""","这些科技领域的企业家大多是""在'经济主义'时代成长起来的，那时候，赚钱、经济原则和经济理性胜过一切""，加州克莱蒙特麦肯纳学院政府学教授裴敏欣说。""现在他们看到这个政权把政治放在首位。对他们来说，这不可理解。"""
"In the past decade, Mr. Xi's economic thinking can be summed up like this: bigger roles for the state, and smaller roles for the market. He left the private sector largely alone in his first term, when he was busy consolidating his power within the party and the military. In his second term, which began in 2017, Mr. Xi kept private enterprises on a much tighter leash. The government cracked down on businesses, sending some of the country's most successful business people into early retirement or self-imposed exile. China's harsh ""zero-Covid"" policy has left the economy in the worst shape in decades.","习近平过去十年的经济思路可以概括为:大政府小市场。在习近平的第一个任期里，他基本上没对民营部门下手，当时他正忙于巩固自己在党内和军队中的权力。在2017年开始的第二个任期里，习近平对民营企业进行了更严格的管理。政府严厉打击民营企业，导致中国一些最成功的商人提前退休或自我流放。中国严厉的""新冠清零""政策已使经济处于几十年来最糟糕的状态。"
"To Chinese in the business elite, who grew accustomed to the privilege and attention their success brought, the Big Boss, as many of them refer to Mr. Xi, doesn't care about the economy or people like them. In his opening address at the party congress, Mr. Xi mentioned ""security"" 52 times, ""Marxism"" 15 times and ""markets"" three times.","对于已经习惯了成功所带来的特权和关注的中国工商界精英们来说，大老板(这是他们中的许多人对习近平的称呼)并不关心经济或像他们这样的人。习近平在二十大开幕式上作报告时，52次提到""安全""，15次提到""马克思主义""，只提了三次""市场""。"
"""There's no question about the shift both in political rhetoric and in action and in also the appointment of the team,"" said Professor Pei, who said he believes that Mr. Xi's leadership lineup shows that he does not value expertise in managing a market-oriented economy. ""He values people who can implement his policy regardless of the economic consequences.""","""无论是政治言论还是行动，以及领导班子的组成，都毫无疑问地发生了变化，""裴敏欣表示。他说，他认为习近平挑选出来的领导阵容表明，他并不重视管理市场导向型经济的专业知识。""他看重那些能够执行他的政策而不考虑经济后果的人。"""
"That makes the business community anxious. Under Mr. Xi, the ability of China's bureaucracy to dictate to the public has increased while its ability to govern has decreased, Guoguang Wu, an adviser to former Premier Zhao Ziyang in the 1980s, told me on my Chinese language podcast.",这让工商界感到焦虑。曾在20世纪80年代担任赵紫阳总理顾问的吴国光在我的中文播客中告诉我，虽然中国官僚机构在习近平领导下增强了对公众发号施令的能力，但治理能力却在下降。
"""When the ability to govern decreases, even in the absence of any particular policy from the top, the ineptitude, brutality, and ignorance of lower-level officials will brew disasters for the common people they rule over,"" said Mr. Wu, who is a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions.","""治理能力削弱后，不用上边有什么很恶的政策，下边官员的无能、蛮横、无知，就会酿造各种直接关系到他们治下的老百姓的灾难，""吴国光说，他现在是斯坦福大学中国经济与制度研究中心的高级研究学者。"
"Many businesspeople have lost a lot of money under ""zero-Covid,"" which has shuttered cities and locked millions of people in their homes for weeks at a time as the government seeks to eliminate the coronavirus.","许多商人受""新冠清零""政策影响损失惨重，政府追求的消灭新冠病毒的目标已导致许多城市封城，数百万人被锁在家中，有时长达好几周。"
"""Under the leadership of this dictator, our great country is falling into an abyss,"" said a hardware tech executive in Shenzhen. ""But you can't do anything about it. It pains and depresses me.""","""在这个独裁者的带领下，这个国家在走向深渊。""深圳一名硬件技术领域的高管说。""你看着它下坠，那种无力感让我痛心、抑郁。"""
"Despite many conversations over the years, we never talked about politics. I was surprised when he called after the party congress to talk about his ""political depression."" He said he used to be very nationalistic, believing that the Chinese were among the smartest and the most hardworking people in the world. Now, he and many of his friends spend most of their time hiking, golfing and drinking. ""We're too depressed to work,"" he said.","尽管多年来我与这些商界人士进行过多次交流，但我们以前从不谈政治。上述高管在二十大结束后给我打电话时说，他有""政治抑郁""，让我感到很惊讶。他说他曾经非常民族主义，认为中国人民是世界上最聪明、最勤奋的人之一。现在，他和他的许多朋友们把大部分时间花在徒步、打高尔夫球和喝酒上。""我们都抑郁了，无法工作，""他说。"
"Until a year ago, his start-up was doing so well that he was planning to take it public. Then he lost a big chunk of his revenues and his new hires sat idly with nothing to do when cities were locked down under the ""zero-Covid"" rules. He said now he has no choice but to lay off more than 100 people, sell his business and move his family to North America.","他的初创公司直到一年前一直表现非凡，以至于他曾有过让公司上市的打算。后来，""新冠清零""政策导致城市被封后，他新雇来的员工们整天闲着，无事可干，他亏了一大笔钱。他说，现在他别无选择，只能裁掉100多人，卖掉自己的生意，举家迁往北美。"
"""Since the dark night has descended,"" he said, ""I'll deal with it the dark night way.""","""既然黑夜已经来临，就按黑夜的方法去处理好了，""他说。"
"The tech entrepreneur from Beijing who texted me after the party congress recounted a chilling experience. In May, when there were rumors that Beijing could be locked down, he felt he could not tell his employees to leave work early and stock up on groceries. He was worried that he could be reported for spreading rumors something that had gotten people detained by the police. He told them only that they should feel free to leave early if they had things to take care of.",二十大后给我发短信的那名北京科技企业家向我讲述了一段令人不寒而栗的经历。今年5月有传言说北京可能要封城时，他觉得他不能叫员工们提前下班去囤货。他担心那样做会被举报散布谣言(有些人曾因这种举报被警方拘留)。他只是告诉员工们，如果他们有事情要处理，有早点下班的自由。
This successful business person is now applying to emigrate to a European country and the United States.,这名成功的商人现在正在申请移民欧洲国家和美国。
"Just like many ordinary Chinese people, the executives I spoke to said they were horrified by the video of Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi's predecessor as China's top leader, being abruptly led out of the closing ceremony of the party congress. They did not accept the official government explanation that Mr. Hu had to leave early because of health issues",和许多普通中国人一样，与我交流的高管们说，他们看到胡锦涛突然被带出二十大会场的视频深感震惊。胡锦涛是中国最高领导人习近平的前任。这些商人不接受政府对此事的解释，官方的说法是胡锦涛因健康问题不得不提前退场。
"If Mr. Xi could remove his predecessor like that, several of them said, he could do anything to anyone.",这些商人中有不少人说，如果习近平能这样对待自己的前任，他可以对任何人下手。
"A well-connected investor in Beijing said that his friends who are entrepreneurs now realized they could no longer remain indifferent to politics. At social gatherings, they have started discussing which countries to seek passports from, and how to move their assets offshore. At social gatherings, hosts are asking friends to surrender their phones to be kept in a separate place for fear of surveillance.",北京的一名人脉广泛的投资者说，他的企业家朋友们现在意识到，不能再对政治漠不关心。他们在社交聚会时开始讨论申请哪些国家的护照，以及如何将资产转移到海外等问题。这些社交聚会的主人现在要求朋友们交出手机，放置在其他地方，以免受到监控。
"After the party congress, most people in the investor's circle expect that they will be forced to pay more in taxes or be expected to donate more money to universities and other state-backed charities. They are not planning to make any big investments.",二十大结束后，投资者圈子中的大多数人预计他们将被迫缴纳更多的税，或被迫向大学和其他国家支持的慈善机构捐款。他们都没有进行任何大投资的计划。
"""We're all anxious,"" he said. ""We're at a loss of what to do at this historical crossroad.""","""大家都很焦虑，""他说。""我们站在历史的十字路口，不知道该怎么办。"""
Hong Kong is eager to show the world that the city is open for business after years of pandemic restrictions. Officials this week even found themselves willing to bend some rules for visitors as long as they could afford it.,香港急于向世界展示，经历了数年疫情限制后，这座城市已经重新敞开大门。本周，官员们甚至愿意为来访者放宽一些规定——只要他们负担得起。
"Bankers in town for the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit were told they could skip mandatory quarantine and leave on a private jet if they tested positive for Covid. Tech executives attending Fintech Week from overseas were allowed to dine in private rooms, despite a rule prohibiting visitors from eating out during their first three days in the city. Spectators at the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament this weekend will be able to eat in the stands after rules were relaxed.",来参加国际金融领袖投资峰会的银行家被告知，如果新冠病毒检测呈阳性，可以不用强制隔离，并且乘坐私人飞机离开。参加金融科技周的海外科技公司高管被允许在餐厅包间用餐，尽管有一项规定禁止来访者在抵达香港的头三天外出就餐。规则放宽后，本周末观看香港国际七人榄球赛的观众可以在看台上吃东西。
"These three splashy events the first in three years to involve international guests were meant to show that Hong Kong was still worthy of its self-appointed title of ""Asia's World City."" But the privileges being doled out to the few have magnified the challenges the former British colony faces as it tries to balance increasing demands fromBeijing, which has final say on Hong Kong's Covid policies, with an internationalcommunity that is determined to move past the pandemic.","这三场引人注目的活动都是三年来首次邀请国际嘉宾参加，意在证明香港仍然无愧其自封的""亚洲国际都会""称号。但向少数人发放的特权放大了这个前英国殖民地面临的挑战，因为它试图在北京越来越多的要求与决心摆脱疫情影响的国际社会之间取得平衡。北京对香港的新冠政策拥有最终决定权。"
"""We were, we are and we will remain one of the world's leading financial centers. And you can take that to the bank,"" John Lee, Hong Kong's leader, told executives, including those from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, on Wednesday. (Mr. Lee, who usually wears a mask at news conferences, took his off for the speech.)","""我们过去是，现在是，将来也将依然是世界领先的金融中心之一。这句话可以打包票，""香港特首李家超周三对来自高盛、摩根士丹利和摩根大通的高管表示。(通常在新闻发布会上戴口罩的李家超在发言时摘下了口罩。)"
"Hong Kong has struggled to break free from Beijing's relentless ""zero-Covid"" policy and restore a global reputation bruised by a widespread crackdown on pro-democracy protests. U.S. lawmakers called on bankers to boycott the investment summit, saying attending would be a form of ""whitewashing"" of China's authoritarian grip on the once semiautonomous territory.","香港一直在努力摆脱北京严苛的""清零""政策，恢复因大规模镇压亲民主抗议活动而受损的全球声誉。美国国会议员呼吁银行家抵制此次投资峰会，称参加峰会无异于""洗白""中国对这块一度半自治的领土的威权控制。"
"For residents who have endured several difficult years of Covid rules, the loopholes and exceptions given to visiting executives sting. ""If the rules are to be fair, it should be done across all levels of society, and if you think it's hard to hold these summits, then just open up Hong Kong,"" said Virginia Chan, the owner of Humid with a Chance of Fishballs Tours.","对于已经艰难忍受了几年新冠疫情规定的居民来说，给来访高管提供的空子和特权刺痛了他们。""如果规则是公平的，那么就应该在社会的各个层面实行，如果你觉得举办这些峰会很难，那就打开香港的大门，""经营导游路线Humid with a Chance of Fishballs Tours的弗吉尼亚·陈(音)说。"
"Like many other business owners in the city, Ms. Chan's bottom line has been devastated by the stringent Covid restrictions. Her company used to run 60 group tours a month. Now, she's grateful to have three so far this month.",和这座城市的许多其他商家一样，严格的新冠限制措施让弗吉尼亚·陈的收益受到了重创。她的公司过去一个月有60个旅游团。现在，这个月到目前为止有三个团就足以令她庆幸。
"Few people would dispute that the city needs an economic jolt. Citywide pro-democracy protests scared off tourists in 2019. Then Covid-19 restrictions barred nonresidents from the city for two years. Lengthy mandatory hotel quarantines triggered an exodus of professional workers, many of whom relocated to rival cities, such as Singapore.",几乎没有人会质疑这座城市需要经济复苏。2019年全市范围内的亲民主抗议吓跑了游客。随后两年，新冠限制措施禁止非居民进入这座城市。长时间的强制酒店隔离导致专业人员大量流失，其中许多人移居到新加坡等竞争城市。
"With the economy heading for a recession, thousands of small businesses have shuttered, pushing many people out of a job.",随着经济走向衰退，数以千计的小企业倒闭，导致许多人失业。
"Officials took a big step toward reopening in September when they jettisoned hotel quarantine requirements. But many say the new approach has made little difference because some restrictions remain in place. Travelers are barred from restaurants, bars and many other businesses for three days after arrival and must undergo health monitoring for a week.",官员们在9月放弃了酒店隔离要求，朝着重新开放迈出了一大步。但许多人表示，新方法收效甚微，因为一些限制仍然存在。游客在抵达后的三天内被禁止进入餐馆、酒吧和其他许多企业，并且必须接受一周的健康监测。
"""There are no tourists coming in,"" said Eric Lee, the owner of a souvenir shop selling retro toy cars and snacks. Revenues at his nearly decade-old business, Hong Kong Tram Store, have fallen by as much as 70 percent in the past two years. ""Will tourists have the patience to scan QR codes here and there?"" he asked, referring to a cumbersome smartphone app required for visitors.","""没有游客进来，""出售复古玩具车和零食的纪念品商店的老板埃里克·李(音)说。过去两年里，他经营了近十年的叮叮老香港办馆的收入下降了70%。""游客会有耐心到处扫二维码吗?""他指的是访客需要使用的一款繁琐的智能手机应用。"
"""You don't have to do these things in other places,"" he said. ""And how about masks?""","""其他地方不用做这些事情，""他说。""还有戴口罩呢?"""
"Some of those small hassles were scrapped for financial executives to convince them to visit the city this week. Even the city's financial secretary, Paul Chan, appeared to be given a pass when he returned to the city after testing positive for Covid while overseas. He also tested positive upon arrival, but was allowed to skip quarantine to attend events, where he abandoned his mask for important speeches.",为了说服金融高管们本周访问这座城市，其中一些小麻烦被消除了。就连在海外新冠病毒检测呈阳性后返回的香港财政司司长陈茂波似乎也得到放行。他抵达时检测也呈阳性，但被允许跳过隔离，参加活动，在重要演讲时他摘下了口罩。
"Mr. Chan told reporters that health officials treated his case like any other. ""There's no particular privilege at all,"" he said.","陈茂波告诉记者，卫生官员对待他的病例和对待其他病例一样。""根本没有什么特别的特权，""他说。"
"Despite the special dispensation given to V.I.P.s, many declined to visit Hong Kong. Officials said 12,000 people signed up for Fintech, a little more than half the 20,000 visitors that organizers expected.",尽管贵宾享有特殊优待，但许多人拒绝来香港旅游。官员们表示，有1.2万人报名参加金融科技周，只是组织者预期的2万人的一半多一点。
"Some of the biggest names on the guest list for the finance summit including Citigroup's Jane Fraser, Blackstone's Jonathan Gray and Capital Group's Timothy Armour canceled at the last minute, with four of them citing Covid-19 or virus-like symptoms.",金融峰会嘉宾名单上的一些大人物——包括花旗集团的范洁恩(Jane Fraser)、黑石集团的乔纳森·格雷和资本集团的蒂莫西·阿穆尔——在最后一刻取消了行程，其中四人以新冠或疑似感染症状为由。
"The bankers who did visit Hong Kong this week mostly limited their stay to just a few days, attending a private dinner at M+, a new contemporary art museum, and meeting with employees for the first time in more than two years.",本周到访香港的银行家大多将停留时间限制在几天之内，他们在新开的当代艺术博物馆M+参加私人晚宴，并在两年多来首次与他们的员工见面。
"Though U.S. lawmakers and advocacy groups had discouraged bankers from attending, officials in Beijing and Hong Kong showered the executives with praise.",尽管美国国会议员和维权组织不鼓励银行家参加，但北京和香港的官员对这些高管给予了高度赞誉。
"""Your presence today puts a heady exclamation point to this welcome gathering,"" Mr. Lee, Hong Kong's leader, told bankers on Wednesday. China's state controlled media trumpeted the summit as a sign of Hong Kong's return as a global city.","""你们今天的出席，为这次欢迎大会加上了一个令人兴奋的感叹号，""香港特首李家超周三对银行家们说。中国官方媒体将此次峰会吹嘘为香港回归全球城市的标志。"
"One Chinese regulator, Fang Xinghai, urged visiting bankers not to read international media's coverage of his country. During a panel discussion with the heads of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the UBS chairman Colm Kelleher assured the audience that ""we're all very pro-China.""","中国监管机构官员方星海敦促来访的银行家不要阅读国际媒体对中国的报道。在与高盛和摩根士丹利负责人的小组讨论中，瑞银董事长科尔姆·凯莱赫向观众保证，""我们都非常支持中国。"""
"Still, it was impossible to shield the executives from the ways in which Hong Kong is trying to adhere to some of Beijing's Covid policies. Outside the ballroom at the Four Seasons Hotel where the finance summit was held, one sign prominently pointed to the ""PCR test center,"" a key requirement that even V.I.P.s were unable to get out of.","尽管如此，香港试图遵守北京的一些新冠政策，要让这些高管们避开它们似乎是不可能的。在举行金融峰会的四季酒店的宴会厅外，一块醒目的标志指向""核酸检测中心""，这是一个关键的要求，就连贵宾们也无法摆脱。"
"In their bid to get more visitors to come back, city officials also adjusted Covid rules for the Rugby Sevens tournament, Hong Kong's top sports event.",为了吸引更多游客回来，香港官员还调整了国际七人榄球赛的新冠规则，这是香港最顶级的体育赛事。
"Initially, officials said no food could be consumed in the stands, but then pivoted to say a small amount would be allowed, though masks were still required. Raphael Seghin, who traveled to Hong Kong on Tuesday and hoped to attend the tournament, said he was confused about what rules still applied.",起初，官员们表示，看台上不能吃任何食物，但后来又改口说，可以吃少量食物，不过仍然需要戴口罩。拉斐尔·塞金于周二前往香港，希望能参加比赛。他说，他对哪些规则仍然适用感到困惑。
"Mr. Seghin had already received two doses of a Covid vaccine when he booked his flight from Marseille, France, where he runs a soap factory. When he heard later that most locals needed three shots to enter restaurants and other venues, he rushed to get a booster before flying out, only to find out that it wouldn't be valid until 14 days later. ""I was stressed the whole ride,"" he said, though he found testing procedures after arrival to be efficient.","预订从法国马赛起飞的航班时，在那里经营着一家肥皂厂的塞金已经接种了两剂新冠疫苗。后来，当他听说大多数当地人需要打三针才能进入餐馆和其他场所时，他赶去打了一针疫苗，然后出发，结果发现疫苗要到14天后才有效。""我全程都很紧张，""他说，不过他发现，到达目的地后的检测程序很有效率。"
"Mr. Seghin, 37, grew up in Hong Kong and was returning to the city to renew his permanent residency.",37岁的塞金在香港长大，准备回香港续上他的永久居留权。
"""I live in a world now where Covid is not part of the preoccupations of most people on a daily basis,"" Mr. Seghin said. ""When you come here, it's at the center of everything you do.""","""我现在生活在一个大多数人日常不关心新冠的世界里，""塞金说。""然而你来到这里，它成了一切事情的中心。"""
"A 3-year-old boy in the Chinese city of Lanzhou died of carbon monoxide poisoning this week after coronavirus restrictions kept him from being taken promptly to a hospital, the latest tragedy to renew public scrutiny of China's ""zero Covid"" policy and its costs.","上周，中国兰州一名三岁男孩一氧化碳中毒，由于新冠防控限制措施导致无法及时送医而死亡，这是引发公众重新审视中国""清零""政策及其代价的最新一起悲剧。"
"The boy's father dialed the city's emergency hotline four times in three minutes on Tuesday but did not get through until the last time, according to a report issued by local officials on Thursday night. On his fourth try, the dispatcher told him that because he lived in an area considered ""high risk"" for the virus, he could seek only online medical counseling.","根据当地官员周四晚间发布的报告，男孩的父亲周二在三分钟内四次拨打该市的急救电话，但直到最后一次才接通。最后拨通后，调度员告诉他，因为他住在一个被视为""高风险""的地区，只能寻求线上诊疗。"
"The father then sought help from officials in his neighborhood, but several instead reprimanded him for not wearing a mask, the report said. Nearly two hours after he first dialed for help, he finally got his son to a hospital less than a 10-minute drive from their home. The boy, Tuo Wenxuan, died soon after they arrived.",报道称，这位父亲随后向附近的工作人员寻求帮助，但有几个人反而斥责他没有戴口罩。在他第一次拨打求助电话近两个小时后，他终于把儿子送到了医院——离他们家不到10分钟车程。男孩妥文轩在他们到达后不久就死了。
"Lanzhou, a city of more than three million in northwestern Gansu province, had recorded 51 new infections that day.",兰州位于西北省份甘肃，人口超过300万，在当天记录了51例新增感染病例。
"The incident came to light when a video of the boy receiving CPR circulated on social media. After a widespread outcry, the district health authorities published their report. They pledged to ""deeply learn from this painful lesson"" and said officials who had failed in their duties would be ""handled seriously.""","男孩接受心肺复苏术的视频在社交媒体流传后，事件逐渐为人所知。在引起广泛抗议后，当地卫生部门公布了他们的调查报告。他们承诺""深刻汲取此次事故沉痛教训""，并表示将""严肃处理""失职干部。"
"But the boy's father, Tuo Shilei, said he took no comfort in that promise.",但男孩的父亲妥世磊表示，这个承诺并没有让他感到安慰。
"""This supposed handling won't happen. I know that. It's pretty much just for show,"" Mr. Tuo, a restaurant owner, said in an exchange of messages. He said his son ""hasn't received a true public accounting, and the public that has cared for and supported us throughout this entire process has not received a convincing, acceptable, open, just outcome.""","""所谓处理不会有我也明白，处理方式几乎只是对外的一种说辞，""餐馆老板妥世磊发信息说。他说他的儿子""也没有得到一个公开的真相，关心和支持整个事件的热心群众没有等到一个具有说服力和大家认同的公开公正的处理结果""。"
He also suggested that he had been warned against pressing for further accountability.,他还表示，他已接到警告，不要要求进一步追究责任。
"""The relatives who've suffered have been subject to endless public discussion and pressure from all kinds of unknown sources, and we have no choice but to temporarily compromise,"" Mr. Tuo said. ""Other than this, there has been no consolation.""","""受害的家属收到满天的舆论和各种不知名压力，不得不暂时妥协，""妥世磊说。""除此以外再没有任何安慰。"""
"China's zero-Covid policy, now in its third year, seeks to eliminate infections through stringent, often repressive, controls on movement and personal freedom. Beijing has said it is meant to save as many lives as possible, while arguing that loose controls in other countries, especially Western ones, had led to millions of deaths.","中国的清零政策现已进入第三个年头，该政策旨在通过对出行和人身自由采取通常是强制性的严格控制措施，来消灭感染。中国政府表示，这是为了挽救尽可能多的生命，同时提出在其他国家，尤其是西方国家，""躺平""已导致数百万人死亡。"
"The controls have kept China's infection and death rates much lower than those elsewhere, and they enjoy significant public support. But they have also sometimes cut off people's access to essentials like food and medical care a trade-off that some see as increasingly unjustifiable as the danger from the virus itself ebbs. Sometimes, the controls appear to have indirectly led to deaths themselves.",这些控制措施使中国的感染率和死亡率远低于其他地方，并且得到了公众的大力支持。但它们有时也切断了人们获得食品和医疗等必需品的途径——随着病毒本身的危险消退，一些人认为这种取舍越来越不合理。有时，控制措施本身似乎间接导致了死亡。
"In September, a bus crashed while taking dozens of people to a quarantine facility in the middle of the night, killing 27; many social media users suggested that a rush to send people to isolation was to blame. Pregnant women have miscarried, and a nurse in Shanghai died of an asthma attack, after being refused care under Covid protocols.",9月，一辆巴士在半夜将数十人送往隔离设施时发生车祸，造成27人死亡;许多社交媒体用户说，是仓促转运导致了事故。还有因新冠防控措施得不到救治，导致孕妇流产，以及上海的一名护士哮喘发作后死亡。
"But the central government has doubled down on zero Covid, with China's leader, Xi Jinping, declaring the strategy a success as he claimed a third term last month. Internet censors quickly scrub public discussion of deaths connected to the restrictions, or try to limit it to an official narrative.",但中央政府已在加大清零力度，中国领导人习近平在上个月宣布第三个任期时宣称该战略取得了成功。互联网审查员迅速删除与防控措施相关死亡事件的公开讨论，或试图将其限定在官方叙述中。
Such censorship appears to have been applied in the case of Mr. Tuo's son.,妥世磊之子的死亡案例似乎就受到了这种审查。
"After Mr. Tuo published a blog post on Wednesday demanding an official explanation for the boy's death, it was read more than 25 million times in seven hours. He wrote that he had first noticed around noon on Tuesday that his wife seemed unwell and after checking on her, saw that his son was unconscious. (The police later said that ""improper use"" of a liquefied gas stove had caused a carbon monoxide leak.)","周三，妥世磊发表博文，要求官方为孩子的死亡做出解释，该文章在七小时内的阅读量超过2500万次。他写道，在周二中午左右，他先是发现妻子似乎身体不适，在查看妻子状况后，他发现儿子已经昏迷不醒。(警方后来说，液化气炉的""使用不当""导致一氧化碳泄漏。)"
"When Mr. Tuo's emergency calls failed, he went outside and asked officials at a checkpoint the area had been sealed off because of the virus for help. They refused, he wrote.",妥世磊的急救呼叫失败后，他出去向卡口的工作人员寻求帮助——该地区因病毒被封控。他们拒绝了，他写道。
"Finally, carrying his son, he tore down some of the fencing that had been put up around his neighborhood, and with the help of another person was able to flag down a taxi. By the time they arrived at the hospital, it was too late.",最后，他带着儿子扯开了他家附近的围挡，在另一个人的帮助下，他拦下了一辆出租车。等他们赶到医院时，已经来不及了。
"""If my son had been sent to the hospital earlier, he might have still been saved,"" Mr. Tuo wrote. He added that someone claiming to be from a nongovernmental organization had offered him 100,000 renminbi, or about $14,000, if he agreed not to hold local officials responsible.","""我的孩子如果能早一些送医院也许还能救过来，""妥世磊写道。他还说，有人自称来自民间组织机构，如果他同意不追究社区的责任，就给他10万元人民币，约合1.4万美元。"
"As public pressure mounted, Lanzhou officials told a state-owned newspaper that they would investigate. But Mr. Tuo's blog post was deleted.",随着公众压力的增加，兰州官员告诉一份官方报纸，他们将进行调查。但妥世磊的帖子被删除了。
"He later posted on a private social media page that the situation had been addressed but that he could not disclose details. Mr. Tuo, who is a member of the Dongxiang ethnic minority, wrote that he had accepted the outcome only because of his Muslim faith.",他后来在一个私人社交媒体页面上发帖称，情况已得到解决，但他无法透露细节。妥世磊写道，他接受这个结果只是因为他的穆斯林信仰。妥世磊属于东乡族。
"When the district government released its report on Thursday night, it quickly became a top trending topic on Weibo, a major social media platform. A related hashtag has been viewed more than 420 million times.",区政府周四晚发布报告后，迅速成为主要社交媒体平台微博上的热门话题。相关主题标签的浏览量已超过4.2亿次。
Many social media users said the official account should have specified who would be punished and how the government would ensure that similar incidents did not occur.,许多社交媒体用户表示，该官方帐号应该明确说明谁会受罚，以及政府将如何确保类似事件不再发生。
"The district government's report did not include an outright apology. It said only that officials would ""constantly improve their work methods"" and that they ""sincerely accepted the criticism"" of the public.","区政府的报告没有直接道歉。它只是说官员将""不断改进工作作风""，""我们诚恳接受""公众的""批评监督""。"
"Other commenters defended the officials involved. Hu Xijin, the retired editor of the state-owned tabloid Global Times, wrote in a social media post that the public should not call for penalties for workers who were merely doing their jobs. He also dismissed the idea that the authorities who designed China's Covid policies were responsible for the boy's death, arguing that the policies were for the good of the people.",其他评论人士则为相关官员辩护。官方小报《环球时报》的退休主编胡锡进在社交媒体上写道，公众不应该要求对只是在做本职工作的工作人员进行追责。他还驳斥了设计中国新冠政策的当局应对男孩的死负责的说法，认为这些政策是为了人民群众。
A significant number of commenters also blamed Mr. Tuo for missing follow-up calls from a hospital that the emergency dispatcher had contacted to arrange online consultation.,相当多的评论者还指责妥世磊错过了紧急调度员联系安排网上问诊医院的后续电话。
"The clearest sign that public anger about the boy's death would not be tolerated may have come on the night he died. When a number of Mr. Tuo's neighbors, including his brother, gathered at one of the local checkpoints to demand an explanation, they were met by armed police officers, who arrested several people, Mr. Tuo said.",公众对于男孩死亡的愤怒得不到允许的最明显迹象出现在事故当晚。妥世磊说，包括他兄弟在内的一些邻居聚集在当地的一个卡口要求解释时，他们遇到了武警，几个人被逮捕，妥世磊说。
"Reached by telephone, police officials at both the Lanzhou police headquarters and the district where Mr. Tuo lives said they had no information to share about that.",记者通过电话联系兰州公安局和妥世磊小区所在的区公安局，他们均表示没有任何信息可以分享。
"Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said in Beijing on Friday that he had been assured that China's approval process for Covid-19 vaccines made by the German company BioNTech would be sped up. In turn, he said, he would push for Chinese vaccines to be granted regulatory approval by the European Union.",德国总理奥拉夫·肖尔茨上周五在北京表示，他已得到中国的保证，将加快德国BioNTech公司生产的新冠疫苗的审批程序。他说，与之相应，他将推动中国疫苗获得欧盟监管批准。
"Mr. Scholz, concluding a one-day visit with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, said preparations were also underway for BioNTech's vaccine to be offered to some expatriates in China, describing this ""a first step.""","肖尔茨在结束为期一天的访问前与中国领导人习近平见了面。肖尔茨说，BioNTech也在为向一些在华外籍人士提供新冠疫苗做准备，称这是""第一步""。"
"BioNTech has been trying for more than two years to win permission for the sale in China of its vaccines, developed with mRNA technology. No mRNA vaccines have been approved in China.",两年多来，BioNTech一直努力争取获得在华销售新冠疫苗的许可。该疫苗采用信使核糖核酸技术(mRNA)，中国目前尚未批准使用该技术的疫苗。
"Mr. Scholz said that he had urged the Chinese side to speed up approval of the BioNTech vaccine. ""I have been strongly advocating that it should now be expedited, because again from our perspective there are no reasons why it should not be approved,"" he said. ""And I have been assured, at any rate, that acceleration will occur.""","肖尔茨说，他已敦促中方加快批准BioNTech的疫苗。""我一直在强烈主张，应该加快审批速度，因为从我们的角度来看，没有理由不批准，""他说。""我已得到保证，无论如何，将加快审批速度。"""
"There was no immediate response from the Chinese government. China's National Health Commission has scheduled a news conference on Saturday afternoon, after a series of rumors that China would ease its Covid-control policies produced this week the sharpest rally in Chinese share prices in seven years.",中国政府没有立即对这个说法做出回应。中国国家卫生健康委员周六下午举行了新闻发布会，此前曾有一系列关于中国将放松新冠防控政策的传言，致中国股市本周出现了七年来的最大涨幅。
"But the National Health Commission does not have authority over the approval of foreign medicines like the BioNTech vaccines, which go through a complicated web of other agencies.",但国家卫健委没有批准像BioNTech疫苗这样的外国药物的权力，它们需要经过一个由其他机构组成的复杂网络完成审批。
"The state-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding, which purchases aircraft on behalf of China's state-controlled airlines, announced separately that it had agreed to buy 140 Airbus passenger jets for $17 billion. Beijing has stopped placing orders for Boeing aircraft lately as numerous disputes simmer between the United States and China, most recently including stringent American restrictions on the sale to China of top-end semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.",代表国有航空公司购买飞机的国企中国航空集团另行宣布，已同意购买总价为170亿美元的140架空客客机。由于美中两国存在大量争端，中国政府最近停止购买波音飞机。最新的争端包括美国严格限制向中国出售高端半导体和半导体制造设备。
"In the early days of the pandemic, BioNTech concluded a deal with a private sector Shanghai company, Fosun Pharmaceutical, to manufacture BioNTech's mRNA vaccine at a Shanghai factory supervised by BioNTech engineers.",疫情初期，BioNTech曾与上海的民营企业复星医药达成协议，由后者在BioNTech工程师的指导下，在上海一家工厂生产BioNTech的mRNA疫苗。
"But China's state-owned vaccine giants never endorsed that arrangement, and have continued to distribute the vaccines that they developed. The Shanghai factory never went into production.",但中国国有的疫苗巨头们从未对这个安排表示过认可，它们继续提供自己研发的疫苗。上海的那家工厂从未开工。
China's own vaccines use inactivated viruses and have proved less effective than mRNA vaccines in studies performed in countries that administered both kinds of vaccines. There have also been recent signs that China's own vaccines lose even more of their effectiveness than mRNA vaccines against Omicron variants.,中国的国产疫苗使用的是灭活病毒，在使用了这两种疫苗的国家所做的研究证明，灭活疫苗的效果不如mRNA疫苗。最近还有迹象表明，在抵御奥密克戎变异株方面，中国国内研发的新冠疫苗比mRNA疫苗的效力要低得更多。
"And unlike Moderna or the partnership of Pfizer and BioNTech, China has not yet introduced a new vaccine tailored to the Omicron variants, which now predominate.",不同于莫德纳以及辉瑞与BioNTech的合作项目，中国尚未推出针对奥密克戎变异株的新疫苗。奥密克戎变异株是目前流行的主要毒株。
"Mr. Scholz said that authorizing the use of BioNTech vaccines for foreigners ""is a good message for expatriates who are living here in China that the option exists to use BioNTech as a vaccine and that they are not further relegated to other vaccines.""","肖尔茨说，批准让外国人接种BioNTech疫苗""对生活在中国的外籍人士来说是个好消息，让他们可以选择BioNTech疫苗，而不受必须使用其他疫苗的限制""。"
"BioNTech declined to comment on the chancellor's remarks. ""We want to make our Covid-19 vaccine available to people in mainland China as soon as it is approved,"" the company said in an emailed statement on Friday. ""This is part of our global strategy and long-term commitment to China, which is a strategically important market for us.""","BioNTech拒绝对肖尔茨的说法发表评论。""我们希望在疫苗得到批准后，尽快让中国大陆的人民用上我们的新冠疫苗获，""公司在上周五通过电子邮件发出的声明中写道。""这是我们全球战略和对中国的长期承诺的一部分，中国市场对我们来说具有重要的战略意义。"""
China and the European Union have had a series of disagreements over the approval of each others' vaccines. China did not approve European brands of vaccines while the European Union was unwilling to approve Chinese vaccine brands.,中国和欧盟在批准彼此的疫苗上存在一系列分歧。中国不批准欧洲公司的疫苗，欧盟也不愿意批准中国公司的疫苗。
"Any move to give precedence to foreigners over the Chinese public in terms of access to imported vaccines could prove politically difficult for the Chinese government. Foreigners were widely resented in China for their special treatment before World War II and particularly before World War I, when European nations and Japan held dozens of colonies and other territorial concessions in coastal China and even as far inland as Wuhan.",任何让外国人优先于中国公众获得进口疫苗的做法都可能给中国政府带来政治上的麻烦。第二次世界大战之前，尤其是第一次世界大战之前，外国人曾在中国享有特殊待遇，那时，欧洲列强和日本曾在中国的沿海地区，甚至远至武汉设立了几十个殖民地和租界，中国人曾对此愤愤不平。
"""If really the Chinese are excluded from it, that would be a bad signal to Chinese society,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor emeritus of government at Hong Kong Baptist University.","""如果真的把中国人排除在外的话，那对中国社会来说是个不好的信号，""香港浸会大学政府学名誉教授高敬文(Jean-Pierre Cabestan)说。"
China has already allowed embassies to bring mRNA vaccines into the country to vaccinate their diplomatic staff.,中国已允许驻华大使馆将mRNA疫苗带入中国，为外交人员接种。
"But for the vast majority of expatriates in China, it has not been possible to obtain mRNA vaccines while in China. Some have tried to get vaccinated as soon as they arrive in foreign countries for vacations or work trips, because few residents of China have been exposed to the virus and so arrive overseas with little or no immunity.",但对绝大多数在中国的外籍人士来说，住在中国让他们不可能接种mRNA疫苗。一些外籍人士去中国之外的地方度假或出差时，落地后会尽快接种mRNA疫苗，因为住在中国的人当中极少有人接触过新冠病毒，所以到海外后几乎没有免疫力。
"Mr. Scholz traveled to China with a delegation of 12 German business leaders, which prompted some criticism in Europe that the trip looked a little like an export promotion exercise. Among them was Ugur Sahin, a founder and head of BioNTech, as well as the heads of Germany's leading publicly traded companies, including Adidas, the chemical giant BASF and automakers BMW and Volkswagen.",陪同肖尔茨访华的是一个由12名德国工商领袖组成的代表团，这在欧洲引发了一些批评，认为此行看起来有点像一次出口促进活动。代表团成员包括BioNTech的创始人兼负责人吴沙忻(Ugur Sahin)，以及包括阿迪达斯、化工巨头巴斯夫、汽车制造商宝马和大众在内的德国主要上市公司的负责人。
"After more than 10 hours in the air, the German delegation touched down in Beijing to a red-carpet welcome with military honors at a largely empty airport. China has halted almost all international travel during the pandemic as part of its stringent ""Covid-zero"" policies to stop the spread of the coronavirus within its borders.","德国代表团飞行了10多个小时后抵达北京，在基本空无一人的机场受到了三军仪仗队的隆重欢迎。中国在新冠病毒大流行期间停止了几乎所有的国际旅行，这是中国为阻止新冠病毒在国内传播而采取的严格""清零""政策的一部分。"
"Mr. Scholz was tested by a German doctor for Covid-19, while the traveling delegation's members were all tested by Chinese doctors.",入境后，肖尔茨接受了德国医生为他进行的新冠病毒核酸检测，随行代表团成员的核酸检测则由中国医生完成。
From the airport the delegation proceeded to a guesthouse in a park where the economic delegation was briefed by German business leaders based in China. The chancellor went on to meet with Mr. Xi for lunch. No media was allowed at the event.,代表团从机场前往钓鱼台国宾馆，在那里听取了常驻中国的德国商界领导们介绍的情况。之后，肖尔茨与习近平共进午餐。这些活动都禁止媒体参加。
"After also meeting with Premier Li Keqiang, Mr. Scholz told reporters that he had asked Mr. Xi to lean on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine and had pushed back against what he described as rising Chinese protectionism.",肖尔茨与中国总理李克强会晤后告诉记者，他已请习近平对莫斯科施加压力，结束俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争，他也对他称之为中国日益抬头的保护主义表示了反对。
"""We have noticed efforts at self-sufficiency are increasingly being discussed in China, where economic exchange used to be in the foreground,"" Mr. Scholz said. ""We had a very open and detailed discussion about all this. I emphasized to my hosts how important it is from our point of view to redress these imbalances.""","""我们已注意到，中国正在越来越多地讨论自给自足的努力，而以前讨论的重点是经济交流，""肖尔茨说。""我们对这一切进行了非常公开和详细的讨论。我向我的东道主强调，从我们的角度来看，纠正这些不平衡有多么重要。"""
Mr. Scholz is the first European Union leader to visit China after Mr. Xi obtained a groundbreaking third five-year term at a twice-a-decade Communist Party congress that ended on Oct. 23.,在10月23日结束的五年一次的中国共产党全国代表大会上，习近平已破天荒地获得了最高领导人的第三个五年任期，肖尔茨是在中共二十大后访问中国的首位欧盟国家领导人。
"Mr. Scholz's visit is important for China, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. Beijing ""requires it for China's difficult economy, for showing the glory of the Congress and the future it guides, and to tell other E.U. powers that they should follow Scholz to be nicer toward China,"" Mr. Shi said.","肖尔茨的访问对中国很重要，中国人民大学国际关系学院教授时殷弘说。中国政府""需要这次访问，因为中国经济目前有困难，也因为政府要向外界展示二十大的辉煌成就及其指导的未来，并告诉其他欧盟大国，他们应该效仿肖尔茨对中国更友好的做法""，时殷弘说。"
"On Monday, China launched another Long March 5B, the powerful rocket it needed to loft pieces of its Tiangong space station. This one sent the third and final piece of the outpost into orbit.","周一，中国发射了另一枚""长征五号B""火箭，这是运载天宫空间站部件所需的强大火箭。这枚火箭将空间站第三个也是最后一个部件送入轨道。"
"And once again, the rocket's 23-ton center core stage will tumble back to Earth, uncontrolled, scattering large, heavy pieces of debris that will hit the surface somewhere.",此外，重达23吨的火箭核心级将再次不受控制地坠落地球，将又大又重的残骸散落于地表的某个地方。
"""Here we go again,"" Ted Muelhaupt, a consultant for the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit group largely financed by the U.S. government that performs research and analysis, said in a news conference on Wednesday.","""又来了，""航空航天公司顾问泰德·穆尔豪普特在周三的新闻发布会上表示，该公司是一家主要由美国政府资助并进行研究和分析的非营利组织。"
"The Long March 5B booster is not the only human-made object, or even the largest, to fall from space. And pieces of spacecraft from other countries, including the United States, have also fallen back to Earth recently including a small piece of a SpaceX vehicle that turned up on an Australian sheep farm in August.","""长征五号B""火箭的助推器并不是唯一从太空坠落的人造物件，甚至也不是最大的。最近还有包括美国在内的其他国家的航天器残骸已落回地球——包括今年8月出现在澳大利亚一处牧羊场的SpaceX航天器的一小部分。"
But Dr. Muelhaupt and other experts emphasize that such incidents differ from China's use of the Long March 5B rocket.,但穆尔豪普特和其他专家强调称，此类事件与中国对长征五号B火箭的使用不同。
"""The thing I want to point out about this is that we, the world, don't deliberately launch things this big intending them to fall wherever,"" he said. ""We haven't done that for 50 years.""","""我想指出的一点是，我们全世界都不会在发射这么大的东西时故意令其随意坠落，""他说。""50年来我们都没有这样做过。"""
Where and when will the rocket body come down?,火箭主体将于何处、何时坠落?
"Where exactly, no one knows yet. But we'll know within a few hours, because it is now dropping quickly back into the atmosphere.",目前，确切地点尚无人知晓。但几小时内就能知道答案，因为它现在正在迅速落回大气层。
"On Friday evening, the Aerospace Corporation predicted that re-entry would occur at 7:20 a.m. Eastern time. If that is accurate, debris will fall into the southern Pacific Ocean. However, as the booster is speeding around the globe at 17,500 miles per hour, a difference of even a few minutes would shift the re-entry by hundreds of miles.",周五晚间，航空航天公司预测，该火箭将于东部时间早7点20分重入大气层。如果预测准确，残骸将落入南太平洋。但由于助推器正以每小时约28000公里的速度绕地球飞行，即使是时间上的毫厘之差，也会导致重入大气层的路程偏移千里。
What are the odds of being struck by falling debris?,被坠落残骸击中的几率有多大?
It depends on where you live.,这要看你住在哪里。
"Because of the orientation of the orbit, if you live somewhere like Chicago or somewhere farther north that includes almost all of Europe and all of Russia the odds of being hit by this falling rocket are zero. The last few orbits also completely miss Asia and South America. Everyone on those two continents is definitely safe.",由于轨道的朝向，如果你住在芝加哥或者更北的地方——包括几乎整个欧洲和整个俄罗斯——被这枚坠落火箭击中的几率为零。轨道的最后几段也完全错过亚洲和南美洲。这两个大洲上的人都绝对安全。
"For people elsewhere, the chances of being hit are minuscule, although not quite zero.",对于其他地方的人而言，被击中的概率也微乎其微，但不完全为零。
"""You've got far better odds of winning the lottery"" than of being hit by part of the Chinese rocket, Dr. Muelhaupt said. ""The risk to an individual is six per 10 trillion. That's a really small number."" (That is, if 10 trillion Chinese Long March 5B rocket boosters fell out of the sky, six of them would hit you personally.)","比起被这枚中国火箭的一部分击中，""你中彩票的几率要高得多，""穆尔豪普特说。""个人面临的风险是10万亿分之六。这是个非常小的数字。""(也就是说，如果10万亿枚中国""长征五号B""火箭助推器从天而降，其中六个会砸到你身上。)"
He puts the odds that all of the nearly eight billion people on Earth will survive unscathed at 99.5 percent.,他认为，地球上近80亿人都安然无恙的几率为99.5%。
"But the 0.5 percent chance that someone will be hurt is ""high enough that the world has to watch and prepare and take precautionary steps, and that has a cost, which is unnecessary,"" Dr. Muelhaupt said.","但是，0.5%的有人受伤的可能性""已经足够高，以至于全世界都必须观察、准备并采取预防措施，而这种代价是不必要的，""穆尔豪普特说。"
Why focus on the Chinese rocket?,为何要关注这枚中国火箭?
"The Long March 5B consists of a large center booster and four smaller side boosters. The side boosters drop off shortly after launch, crashing harmlessly in the Pacific Ocean. But, by design, the core booster stage goes all the way to orbit before deploying its payload.","""长征五号B""火箭由一个大型芯级助推器和四个较小的侧翼助推器组成。侧翼助推器在发射后不久脱落坠入太平洋，没有造成任何伤害。但根据设计，其芯级助推器需要飞向轨道部署有效载荷。"
"For this mission, the rocket carried Mengtian, a science laboratory module, for the Chinese space station, Tiangong.","这枚火箭此次任务搭载了中国天宫空间站的""梦天""实验舱。"
"Mengtian docked to China's orbital outpost on Tuesday. Tiangong, designed to last at least 10 years, is not as big as the International Space Station it is more comparable in size to the Russian Mir space station that orbited from 1986 to 2001. But it will establish a more permanent base in space than China's earlier space stations, and more than 1,000 scientific experiments are planned for it in the years to come.","""梦天""实验舱已于周二与中国的轨道前哨对接。""天宫""空间站的设计寿命为至少10年，它没有国际空间站那么大，其大小更接近于1986年至2001年间运行的俄罗斯""和平号""空间站。但它将在太空中建立一个比中国早期空间站更固定的基地，并计划在未来几年进行上千次科学实验。"
The Chinese rocket engineers who designed the Long March 5B did not include any way to guide the spent core booster to an empty part of an ocean.,"设计""长征五号B""的中国火箭工程师没有顾及到任何将废弃芯级助推器引导至空旷海洋区域的方法。"
"Instead, the booster gradually falls as it rubs against the wisps of the upper atmosphere. How fast it falls depends on the air density. That varies, because the Earth's atmosphere puffs outward when the sun is active, spewing out more charged particles, and contracts when the sun is quieter.",相反，助推器会在与上层大气的缕缕摩擦中逐渐下落。其下落速度取决于空气密度。数据会有变动，因为地球大气层会在太阳活跃时向外膨胀，喷出更多带电粒子，太阳不活跃时则会收缩。
Has the rocket's debris caused damage in the past?,该火箭的残骸以往是否造成过破坏?
"Two of the three previous launches of the Long March 5B one of the most powerful rockets in operation today ended with large chunks of metal landing near populated areas. Although no one has been injured, the proximity illustrated the dangers.","作为目前威力最大的运行中火箭之一，""长征五号B""此前三次发射，有两次存在大块金属落在有人居住区域附近的情况。虽然无人受伤，但距离的接近表明了其危险性。"
"For the first launch of the rocket, in 2020, the booster made an uncontrolled re-entry over West Africa, with some debris landing on a village in Ivory Coast. After the third launch, in July, the uncontrolled re-entry occurred over Southeast Asia, with pieces landing in Malaysia.",该火箭在2020年首次发射时，助推器在西非上空失控再入，一些残骸落到了科特迪瓦的一处村庄。在今年7月的第三次发射后，失控再入发生在东南亚，有残骸落在马来西亚。
"""Again, big chunks of metal have come down near where people are,"" Dr. Muelhaupt said.","""再一次，大块大块的金属掉落在人类居住地的附近，""穆尔豪普特说。"
He said there was no indication that China had made any of the significant modifications to the rocket design that would be needed for a controlled re-entry.,他说，没有迹象表明中国对火箭设计进行了任何控制重入大气层所需的重大修改。
Will this happen again?,这种情况还会重演吗?
"China has at least one more Long March 5B launch planned, for next year, to put in orbit a space telescope, Xuntian, that would rival NASA's Hubble space telescope.","中国计划明年至少再进行一次""长征五号B""火箭发射，将可与美国宇航局的""哈勃""太空望远镜相媲美的""巡天号""空间望远镜送入轨道。"
"And it is probable that debris from American rockets and spacecraft will turn up on land again, too, like the SpaceX vehicle part found in Australia.",美国火箭及航天器的残骸也很可能会再次坠落地表，正如在澳大利亚发现的SpaceX航天器部件一样。
"But there is little need to worry about the upcoming flight of NASA's massive moon rocket, the Space Launch System, the agency says. The S.L.S., the biggest rocket to fly since the Saturn V used for the Apollo missions, is scheduled to make its first flight later this month. Its center core stage travels almost all the way to orbit, but NASA officials said on Thursday that its trajectory was designed to re-enter not long after launch in a specific unpopulated area.","但美国宇航局表示，对接下来重型月球火箭""太空发射系统""(简称SLS)的飞行无须有多少担忧。SLS是继用于""阿波罗""任务的""土星5号""之后最大的火箭，计划在本月晚些时候进行首次发射。该火箭的中央核心级会几乎抵达轨道，但美国宇航局官员周四表示，其轨迹按照设计会在发射后不久再入，落入一个具体的无人区域。"
"""It's in an area of the ocean where it won't affect anyone,"" said James Free, the associate administrator for exploration systems at NASA.","""它会落到不影响到任何人的海域，""管理美国宇航局勘探系统的副署长詹姆斯·弗里说道。"
"Covid lockdown measures have generated a wave of fear and unrest inside the world's largest iPhone manufacturing complex, in north-central China, with stories of food shortages among quarantined employees filling social media, and large numbers of workers fleeing the facility.",位于中国中北部地区的全球最大iPhone制造园采取的新冠封控措施已在园区内引发了一波恐惧和骚乱，社交媒体上充满了被隔离员工没有足够食物的故事，大批工人逃离工厂。
"The plant, operated by Foxconn, the Taiwan-based manufacturing giant with facilities across China, went into lockdown in mid-October as coronavirus cases were rising in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province. Under China's zero-Covid policies, cities and companies are expected to take strict measures to eliminate transmission of the virus.",该园区由在中国各地设有工厂的台湾制造业巨头富士康运营。随着河南省会城市郑州的新冠感染病例增加，富士康郑州园区于10月中旬进入封控状态。按照中国的新冠清零政策，城市和企业会采取严格措施，阻断病毒传播。
"As Covid cases began to be detected in the plant, Foxconn shut the facility off from the outside world, walling its roughly 200,000 workers inside its grounds. It banned eating in the factory's cafeteria, forced employees to take long, circuitous routes from their dormitories to reduce contact with others, and required daily coronavirus testing and temperature checks.",随着工厂里开始检测出新冠病毒感染病例，富士康关闭了园区与外界的联系，将约20万名工人关在了里面。富士康禁止员工在工厂的自助餐厅堂食，迫使员工从宿舍到厂房绕道走更远的路，以减少与他人的接触，并要求员工每天做核酸检测、量体温。
"But what really worried workers were accounts that emerged from employees who had been taken into quarantine after testing positive. At the mercy of Foxconn to feed themselves, some said they were getting inadequate food or none at all, and were also lacking other necessities.",但真正让员工们担心的是那些核酸检测呈阳性后被集中隔离的人的故事。他们在隔离期间全靠富士康送饭吃，一些人说他们没得到足够的食物，甚至根本没有食物，还缺少其他生活必需品。
"As these stories spread on social media, other workers decided they were better off fleeing their job than risk catching the virus and being forced into quarantine. Two workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared retaliation from the company, said that hundreds of workers had left the plant.",随着这些故事在社交媒体上传开，其他工人决定，逃离工厂是更好的选择，而不是留在园区里冒感染病毒、被集中隔离的风险。两名由于担心公司报复不愿透露姓名的工人说，数百名工人已逃离了园区。
"With transportation restricted as Zhenghzou dealt with the outbreak, many had no options but to walk home, some over long distances.",由于郑州为应对疫情限制了交通，许多工人别无选择，只能步行回家，有些人走了很远的路。
"China's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been promoted by Xi Jinping, who last month won a third term as China's leader. The policy, marked by severe lockdowns and quarantines, has led to the shutdown of entire cities because of a handful of cases.",上个月获得了最高领导人第三任期的习近平力推新冠清零政策。其标志性措施是严格封控、集中隔离，整座城市会因出现少数感染病例而封城。
"On Wednesday, Zhenghzou officials ordered the region around the plant to go into a seven-day lockdown, imperiling any further attempts to flee. A local notice called the outbreak ""serious and complex,"" as the city reported 358 new locally transmitted cases on Wednesday, up from 24 on the same day a week before.","周三，郑州市官员下令对富士康园区周边地区实施七天封控管理，使试图逃离变得艰难。当地发布的一份通报称疫情""严重复杂""，郑州市周三通报了358例新增本土感染病例，相比之下上周三为24例。"
"On Monday, the authorities closed the Shanghai Disney Resort after an outbreak of 10 Covid cases in Shanghai, Reuters reported. Visitors at the theme park were kept inside until they could provide a negative test.",据路透社报道，上海在发现了10例新冠病毒感染病例后，当局于周一关闭了上海迪士尼乐园。已进入园区的游客被留在里面，拿到核酸检测阴性的结果后才能离开。
"Earlier experiences in China, such as those with a Shanghai lockdown earlier this year, suggest that the Zhenghzou measures could extend beyond what was initially announced. Visiting the complex on Tuesday, the province's governor urged the company to improve the care of its workers.",中国早些时候的经历(比如今年四五月份的上海封城)表明，郑州市采取限制措施的时间可能要比最初宣布的长。河南省省长周二视察了富士康园区，要求公司改善工人待遇。
"Apple, the maker of the iPhone, did not respond to a request for comment. In an emailed statement, Foxconn, one of the principal assemblers of Apple products, referred to its pandemic measures as a ""protracted battle"" and insisted that its workers were receiving three meals a day.","IPhone生产商苹果公司没有回复记者的置评请求。在用电子邮件发来的声明中，作为苹果产品主要组装商之一的富士康把公司的新冠防疫措施称为""持久战""，并坚称工人们可以吃上一日三餐。"
"But employees accused Foxconn of a chaotic and at times illogical Covid response. They said that the company had sent workers who tested positive for the coronavirus into quarantine centers together with their close contacts, even when those individuals had tested negative. At the same time, other close contacts were told they must continue working.",但员工们指责富士康的疫情应对混乱，有时甚至不合逻辑。他们说，公司已将核酸检测阳性的工人和密接者们一起送往隔离中心，即使密接者的核酸检测结果阴性。与此同时，另一些密接者则被告知必须继续工作。
"Leo Lin, 29, who works inside the factory complex, described an atmosphere of panic as quarantine facilities began to overflow and the factory lost its grip on isolating close contacts.",在园区工作的29岁的利奥·林描述了区内的恐慌气氛，随着集中隔离设施出现人满为患的问题，厂方不再对密切接触者进行集中隔离。
"For years, Zhengzhou, a city of 10 million people, has helped supercharge China's export-driven economic model. Known as ""iPhone City,"" it has come to manufacture roughly half of Apple's global iPhone supply.","有1000万人口的郑州多年来一直是帮助推动中国出口导向型经济的榜样。郑州有""iPhone城""之称，苹果在全球市场上销售的iPhone近一半来自这里。"
The seven-day lockdown announced on Wednesday may hurt Foxconn's ability to ship iPhones from the plant. China's economy as a whole is growing at its slowest pace in decades under the government's policy of preventing infections with strict lockdowns that can shut down entire regions over just a handful of cases.,郑州市周三宣布的七天封控可能会影响富士康郑州工厂的iPhone出货能力。在政府防止新冠病毒感染的政策指导下，个别病例的出现能让整个地区进入严格封控状态，中国的经济整体增速已经放缓至几十年来最低水平。
"In a sign of Foxconn's concern about the exodus of workers, the company last week began offering them an extra $14 a day to continue working. On Tuesday, the company increased the figure to $55 a day, according to an official announcement.",有迹象表明，员工出逃已经引起富士康的担忧，公司从上周开始给留下来工作的员工每天补贴50元。据周二发布的通知，补贴金额已增加到每天400元。
"Initially, Foxconn did not allow its workers to leave the facility, but as public outrage mounted on social media, the company relented. One worker told The New York Times that it was unclear whether those who left would keep their jobs or get paid for work already performed.",富士康最初曾不允许工人离开园区，但随着公众在社交媒体上表达的愤怒越来越强烈，厂方做出了让步。一名工人对《纽约时报》说，目前还不清楚离开的人是否能保住他们的工作，或能否拿到他们已完成工作的报酬。
"Gao Mingjun, the daughter of a Foxconn worker, said her mother had not tested positive during the outbreak. But the factory placed her mother in quarantine with a colleague sleeping in the bunk above her. That co-worker later tested positive.",富士康工人的女儿高明君(音)说她的母亲在这轮疫情期间核酸检测没有出现过阳性。但富士康将她与一名同事一起集中隔离，那位同事睡在她母亲的上铺，后来核酸检测阳性。
"Around 5 p.m. on Saturday, her mother decided to walk the 38 miles back to her home in Xuchang, exiting through the complex's front gate with about 100 co-workers. Some eight hours later, Ms. Gao called her exhausted mother, asking her to take a break at the side of the road. ""Her feet hurt too much, and they were all blistered up,"" Ms. Gao said.","上周六下午5点左右，高母决定步行60公里回许昌老家，她和大约100名同事一起走出了园区的前门。八个多小时后，高女士与精疲力竭的母亲通了电话，她叫母亲在路边休息一下。""她的脚太疼了，都起血泡了，""高女士说。"
"At dawn on Sunday, after having walked all night, her mother reached the community center in Xuchang.",周日黎明时分，高母在走了一整夜后，来到了许昌的社区中心。
"""The trek was very long,"" Ms. Gao said of her mother's journey. ""She's definitely not going back to Foxconn.""","""那段路真的很长，""高女士谈到母亲的行程时说。""她肯定不会回富士康了。"""
"China launched the third and final module of its space station on Monday, a significant step as the country expands its extensive scientific research outside the Earth's atmosphere.",中国周一发射了其空间站的第三个也是最后一个舱段，这是该国在地球大气层外扩展其广泛科学研究的重要一步。
"State television broadcast the launch live, showing a rocket roaring into a gray layer of clouds above Hainan Island in southernmost China, with the module aboard. Deng Hongqin, the director of the launch command center, announced after 14 minutes that the module was in orbit.",国家电视台现场直播了发射过程，在中国最南端的海南岛，载着该实验舱的一枚火箭轰鸣着冲入灰色云层。发射指挥中心主任邓洪钦在14分钟后宣布，舱段已进入预定轨道。
"Nearly 59 feet long and weighing 23 tons, the module, called Mengtian, docked with the Tiangong space station about 13 hours after launch. The module carries a wide range of experimental equipment, including extremely accurate atomic clocks and gear designed to create the coldest conditions ever achieved by humanity.","名为""梦天""的实验舱长17.88米，重23吨，在发射约13小时后与天宫空间站对接。该实验舱携带各种实验设备，包括高度精确的原子钟以及用于实现人类有史以来最冷环境的设备。"
"Yang Hong, the space station's chief designer, said at a news conference in April that the Mengtian module would be equipped with a cargo airlock. Outside the airlock will be a platform on which experiments can be mounted, with robotic arms to help carry them out, he said. The module will supply the space station with racks of additional laboratory equipment and give the astronauts more room to operate.",空间站总设计师杨宏在4月的新闻发布会上表示，梦天实验舱将配备货物气闸舱。他说，气闸舱外将是一个可以安装实验设备的平台，在机械臂协助下进行实验。该实验舱将为空间站提供许多额外的实验室设备，并为宇航员提供更多操作空间。
"Completing the space station is the latest step in Beijing's broad effort to match and eventually surpass the United States in the exploration of space, and to build a broad base of knowledge for China's large and ever-growing scientific community.",建成空间站是北京在太空探索方面追赶并最终超越美国的广泛努力的最新一步，并为中国庞大且不断发展的科学领域建立广阔的知识基础。
"The station's core module, called Tianhe, went into space last year. In July, China followed up by launching the first of two science modules, the Wentian, which then docked with the core. Once the Mengtian module docks, the completed space station will essentially have a ""T"" shape.","空间站的天和核心舱于去年进入太空。7月，中国又发射了问天实验舱，与核心对接，这是两个科学实验舱中的第一个。一旦梦天实验舱合体完成交会对接，空间站将实现""T""字基本构型。"
"Like the first two modules, the Mengtian was launched on a Long March 5B rocket. These launches have prompted criticism from the United States, because China has not demonstrated the ability to control where the rocket's 23-ton core booster stage, as tall as a 10-story building, will hit the Earth on re-entry.",梦天与前两个舱段一样，都是由长征五号B火箭发射的。这几次发射引起了美国的批评，因为中国没有展现出自己有能力控制火箭重达23吨、有10层楼高的芯级助推器，令其坠落在指定位置。
"Typically, the core stages of similar rockets that reach orbit fire their engines again after releasing their payloads. That allows them to be aimed at unpopulated areas, like the middle of an ocean, when they fall from orbit. But so far, China has not shown that the Long March 5B can do this.",通常，类似的火箭在进入轨道后，其芯级在释放运载物后会再次点火。这使它们在从轨道坠落时能够瞄准无人居住的区域，例如海洋。但到目前为止，中国还没有证明长征五号B可以做到这一点。
"After a Long March 5B launch in 2020, the booster re-entered over West Africa. Debris caused damage to villages in Ivory Coast, but no injuries. When another Long March 5B was used last year to launch the space station's Tianhe core, the booster fell into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives.",2020年长征五号B发射后，助推器重新进入西非上空。碎片对科特迪瓦的村庄造成破坏，但没有人员受伤。去年长征五号B发射空间站天和核心舱时，助推器落入马尔代夫附近的印度洋。
"And in July, after China launched the Wentian module, much of the booster burned up over the Sulu Sea, southeast of the Philippines.",7月，在中国发射问天舱后，大部分助推器在菲律宾东南部的苏禄海上空烧毁。
"The China Manned Space Agency said in an online statement that it had made adjustments to the Long March 5B used for the launch on Monday. But those changes involved putting the Mengtian module into orbit more accurately, not guiding the booster back to earth.",中国载人航天工程办公室在一份网络声明中表示，已对用于周一发射的长征五号B火箭进行了调整。但这些变化涉及将梦天舱段更准确地送入轨道，而不是引导助推器返回地球。
"The Mengtian module is designed to function in space for 10 years, state television said. One of its first experiments will involve testing how seeds grow after being exposed to microgravity and the radiation of space. Chinese scientists also plan to use it to study how spiders spin webs in free fall, an experiment that has also been performed aboard the International Space Station.",国家电视台称，梦天实验舱的设计使用寿命为10年。它的首批实验之一将包括测试种子在暴露于微重力和太空辐射后如何生长。中国科学家还计划用它来研究蜘蛛如何在微重力自由落体中结网，这项实验在国际空间站上也进行过。
"Chinese stocks whipsawed on Monday, in an apparent sign of investors' unease over Xi Jinping's tighter grip on the nation.",中国股市周一大幅震荡，显示习近平收紧对中国的控制令投资者感到不安。
"The CSI 300 Index of large Chinese companies' share prices fell about 1.3 percent, then erased the losses before declining more than 1 percent by midafternoon. In Hong Kong, two indexes the benchmark Hang Seng Index and one that tracks Chinese stocks traded in the city had even wilder swings.",中国大型企业股价的沪深300指数下跌约1.3%后回弹，至午后再次下跌超过1%。在香港，两个指数——基准恒生指数和一个追踪在香港交易的中国股票的指数——波动幅度甚至更大。
"The volatility extended the recent turbulence for Chinese stocks, which were battered last week after Mr. Xi was confirmed for a third term as China's leader. Under Mr. Xi, China has shifted its approach to how it manages the economy, exerting more state control after years of allowing markets a freer hand.",上周习近平确认连任中国领导人第三任期后，中国股市遭受重创，此次是这种动荡的进一步加剧 。在习近平的领导下，中国已经转变了管理经济的方式，在允许市场更加自由多年后，实施了更多的国家控制。
"One of his signature policies, a zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic that involves harsh lockdowns, has led to uncertainty about doing business in China. On Monday, those concerns were compounded as government data showed that factory and services activity had declined last month in the country.",他的一项标志性政策是对大流行的清零政策，严厉封锁措施导致在中国开展业务面临不确定性。周一，政府数据显示中国上个月的工厂和服务业活动有所下降，使担忧加剧。
"Some investors had hoped that at this month's Communist Party congress, Mr. Xi would signal an easing of the ""zero-Covid"" policy. Instead, he doubled down on it. As the party extended his leadership for another term, the authorities ordered a new wave of lockdowns, most notably in the city of Zhengzhou, home to the largest iPhone manufacturing plant in the world.",一些投资者曾希望，在本月的共产党全国代表大会上，习近平会发出放松清零政策的信号。而他反而加大了实施力度。随着中共让他连任，延长了他的领导，当局下令进行新一轮的封锁，尤其是世界上最大的iPhone制造工厂所在的郑州市。
"On Monday, the CSI Index closed down 0.9 percent, extending last week's decline of 5.4 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks mainland companies traded in Hong Kong, ended the day 1.8 percent lower, while the Hang Seng Index fell 1.2 percent. They had each lost more than 8 percent last week.",周一，中证指数收盘跌0.9%，延续上周5.4%的跌幅。追踪在香港交易的内地公司的恒生中国企业指数收盘跌1.8%，恒生指数下跌1.2%。上周两个指数分别下跌了8%以上。
"Wang Xiaodong once gave a speech declaring that ""China's forward march is unstoppable."" He published essays calling on China to build up its military. He co-wrote a book, bluntly titled ""China Is Unhappy,"" in which he said the country should aim to control more land and shape global politics. ""We should lead this world,"" he said.","王小东曾在一次演讲中宣称:""中国前进的步伐不可阻挡。""他曾发表文章呼吁中国加强军事建设。他与人合著的一本书，名字就叫《中国不高兴》，书中写道，中国的目标应该是控制更多的土地、塑造全球政治。""我们应该领导这个世界，""他写道。"
"Now, Mr. Wang, a 66-year-old Beijing-based writer once called the standard-bearer of Chinese nationalism, has another message: That nationalism has gone too far.",王小东现年66岁，这名曾被称为中国民族主义旗手的北京作家现在开始传递另一个信息:中国的民族主义走得太远了。
"For years, it was Mr. Wang whom many Chinese dismissed as too radical, as he railed that the Chinese establishment was too beholden to Western ideas and global trade, too content to let China ease into a world order rigged by the United States.",多年来，王小东在许多中国人眼里曾是个过于激进的人，他抱怨中国的当权派太受制于西方思想和全球贸易，太满足于让中国融入由美国控制的世界秩序。
"Then, as China grew more powerful, his message championing nationalism and his combative, only-idiots-disagree-with-me style found a following. His book became a best seller. Today, swagger about the country's greatness is a staple of Chinese public conversation, from diplomatic declarations to social media chatter.",后来，随着中国变得越来越强大，他宣扬的民族主义信息——以及他好斗的风格、不同意我观点的人都是白痴的态度——获得了大批追随者。他的书成了畅销书。如今，从外交声明到社交媒体群聊等中国公开言论平台，关于中国有多么伟大的豪言壮语已成为主要内容。
"But rather than reveling in that success, Mr. Wang has become alarmed by it. Egged on by government propaganda, Chinese nationalism has become increasingly volatile and vitriolic. And so Mr. Wang has found himself in the unexpected position of trying to tamp down the movement that he helped ignite nearly 35 years ago.",但是这种成功没有令王小东陶醉，反而令他产生了警惕。在政府宣传的煽动下，中国的民族主义已变得愈发易燃易爆。结果是，王小东发现自己正试图抑制自己近35年前帮助点燃的这场运动，这令他始料不及。
"To his millions of social media followers, he now opines that excessive self-regard imperils China's rise,which he no longer calls inevitable. In blog posts and videos infused with a professorial some say lecturing demeanor, he warns that cutting off relations with the United States would be self-defeating. He lashes out at other nationalist influencers, accusing them of stoking extreme emotions to win followers.",现在，他对自己在社交媒体上的数百万关注者发表的观点是，自视过高将会危及中国的崛起，他也不再认为中国的崛起不可避免。在充满了像是教授上课(有些人称之为说教)的博客文章和视频中，他警告说，切断与美国的关系将会带来事与愿违的后果。他抨击其他民族主义网红，指责他们为赢得关注者而煽动极端情绪。
"Now, this pioneer of nationalist bravado is the one fending off criticisms of being too moderate, too cozy with the West, even a traitor.",现在，这位张扬民族主义的先驱正在抵挡指责他过于温和、过于亲西方、甚至是叛徒的批评。
"Mr. Wang, who in person is warmer than his public persona might suggest, has greeted the reversal with a mixture of astonishment and amusement.",和他的公众形象可能给人的感觉相比，王小东本人显得更友好，他对民族主义者对他看法的逆转既感到惊讶，又觉得有点好笑。
"""They've forgotten, in the past few decades, I've been called nationalism's godfather. I created them,"" he said in an interview over tea and steamed fish at a Shanghainese restaurant near his home in Beijing. ""But I never told them to be this crazy.""","""他们都忘了，我在过去几十年当中，我被称为是中国民族主义的旗手，民族主义的教父，我是他们的祖师爷，是我造就他们，""他在北京住所附近的一家上海菜餐馆里接受了采访，边喝茶边吃清蒸鱼。""但是我真的从来没有教过他们这个样子 ，我从来没有教过他们文革是好的，从来没有告诉他们可以这样的疯狂。"""
"The divide may be, in part, generational. For young people who have known only an ascendant China, a strident posture toward the rest of the world may feel natural. Other older public figures have raised similar concerns to Mr. Wang; Yan Xuetong, an often-hawkish international relations professor, lamented this year that students held an overly confident, ""make-believe"" mind-set about China's global stature.","这种分歧在某种程度上可能是世代差异。对那些只看到过中国崛起的年轻人来说，对世界其他国家的强硬姿态也许很自然。其他年龄更大的公众人物也提出了与王小东类似的担忧;经常持鹰派立场的国际关系学教授阎学通今年曾感叹，学生们对中国的全球地位抱有一种过度自信的""假想""心态。"
China's humbler history has been central to Mr. Wang's worldview.,中国更卑微时代的历史是王小东世界观的核心。
"Born to well-educated parents his father was an engineer, his mother a teacher he was 10 when Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution. Mr. Wang's school closed for two years; he read old textbooks on his own.",王小东出生在一个知识分子家庭，父亲是工程师，母亲是教师。毛泽东发动文化大革命那年他10岁，他的学校停了两年课，他只好用旧教科书自学。
"That tumultuous period instilled in Mr. Wang a lasting pugnaciousness. Unsupervised, he and his friends frequently brawled with other young people. ""It made me feel very self-righteous I could fight like that, without any punishment,"" he said, with a smirk familiar to viewers of his videos. ""That was not necessarily a great lesson for me.""","那个动荡时代给王小东带来了持久的斗志。没有大人管他们，他和朋友们经常跟其他年轻人打架。""它让我非常自以为是，居然可以这么打人，什么惩罚都没受到，""他说，脸上浮现出一个他的视频观众们非常熟悉的得意笑容。""这个对我并不是一个很好的教育。"""
"After the Cultural Revolution ended, Mr. Wang enrolled at Beijing's prestigious Peking University to study math an educational pedigree this unapologetic elitist frequently invokes.",文革结束后，王小东考上了著名的北京大学，学习数学，毫不掩饰自己是精英的他经常提到这个教育背景。
"But Mr. Wang's attention quickly slipped from classes. The 1980s were a heady time of new ideas and national soul-searching, as the country distanced itself from Mao's suffocating reign. Mr. Wang began devouring foreign novels, becoming more accessible as China opened its economy. He practiced English by listening to Voice of America and reading Reader's Digest.",但王小东的兴趣很快从课堂上转移开来。20世纪80年代，随着国家逐渐摆脱毛泽东令人窒息的统治，中国有出现了一段令人兴奋的时期，充满了新思想，以及对国家的反思。王小东开始大量阅读外国小说，随着中国经济的开放，这些小说也越来越容易找到。他还通过收听美国之音和阅读《读者文摘》练习英语。
"Soon, though, he would decide China's interest in the West had gone too far.",但他很快就得出结论，认为中国对西方的兴趣过头了。
"He traces his first major brush with nationalism to 1988, when the state broadcaster aired a documentary, River Elegy, which blamed China's backwardness on its traditional civilization and urged the country to learn from Japan and the West. Mr. Wang, by then working as a young economics professor, was outraged. He wrote a short essay criticizing the series as self-loathing an idea he would later dub ""reverse racism.""","他认为自己第一次重要的民族主义行为是在1988年，那年中央电视台播出了纪录片《河殇》，将中国的落后归咎于传统文化，呼吁中国向日本和西方学习。王小东当时是一名年轻的经济学教授，他被该片激怒，写了一篇短文，批评这部记录片自卑——他后来将其称为""逆向种族主义""。"
"It was a bold argument, given the documentary's imprimatur of state approval. Mr. Wang said he was able to publish it only by pleading with an editor at the newspaper China Youth Daily, which ran it not in the politics section but in the lower-profile entertainment pages.",考虑到那部纪录片的播放是得到国家正式批准的，王小东提出的观点很大胆。王小东说，那篇文章是他央求了《中国青年报》的一名编辑后才得以发表。该报没有把文章放在政治版，而是放在了比较低调的影视版。
"It aroused intense debate anyway. And it made Mr. Wang a leading voice of Chinese nationalism, a movement that was gaining momentum as the broader political atmosphere changed. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, the government turned on the political openness of the 1980s and became more guarded toward the outside world.",尽管如此，文章还是引发了激烈的争论。让王小东成为中国民族主义的一个主要声音。随着更广泛的政治气氛发生变化，该运动的势头日益增长。1989年天安门广场大屠杀后，政府改变了20世纪80年代的政治开放性，对外部世界变得更加谨慎。
Mr. Wang was there to cheer it on and to argue that it didn't go far enough.,王小东成了这场运动的鼓吹者，他认为民族主义走得还不够远。
"He churned out increasingly provocative books and essays, arguing that China should become more militant to survive American hegemony. He said China's huge population demanded more resources which might not be attainable through peaceful means alone.",他撰写了大量越来越具挑衅性的书籍和文章，认为中国应该更加好战，以抵御美国的霸权主义。他说，中国庞大的人口需要更多的资源，这可能无法仅仅通过和平的手段获得。
"In ""China Is Unhappy,"" published in 2009, he called those who said China was not ready to take on the United States ""slaves"" who ""glorified peace.""","在2009年出版的《中国不高兴》一书中，他把那些说中国还没有准备好与美国较量的人称为""美化和平""的""奴隶""。"
"The book climbed a best-seller list, earning international headlines. But in a sign that China was still negotiating its relationship to nationalism, the book was also widely criticized. Liberal intellectuals accused it of poisoning and militarizing China's youth. Xinhua, the state news agency, quoted readers' reviews calling it ""poor and radical.""","虽然这本书上了畅销书排行榜，国外对其也有报道，但它在国内遭到了广泛的批评，这表明中国仍在对需要什么样的民族主义进行辩论。自由派知识分子指责该书毒害中国年轻人，让他们想打仗。官方通讯社新华社引用读者的评论说该书""糟糕且激进""。"
"That uneasiness would soon dissipate. As China's hosting of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 fueled a new national confidence, Mr. Wang at first was thrilled. He was especially excited by how the internet helped those ideas spread, arguing it proved the organic appeal of nationalism and his own ideas.",对这本书的不安很快就消失了。中国2008年举办的北京奥运会，将国家自信推向了新高。王小东一开始非常激动，他尤其对互联网如何帮助传播这些思想感到兴奋，认为这证明了民族主义的有机吸引力、以及他本人思想的正确性。
"But gradually, that sense of vindication turned to concern.",但渐渐地，这种自己被证明正确的感觉被担忧取代了。
Tensions between China and the West intensified as trade deficits soared and China's military began flexing its new muscles in places like the South China Sea.,随着与他国的贸易顺差飙升、以及中国开始在南海等地区展示新的军事力量，中国与西方的紧张关系也在加剧。
"The animus then spiked after the outbreak of the coronavirus, and some social media users began cheering the idea of severing economic ties with the United States, bragging that China could go it alone. Even cultural exchange became a target: users attacked vegetarianism as a foreign import, or questioned people for cosplaying in kimonos.",新冠疫情暴发后，西方对中国的敌意急剧上升，中国一些社交媒体用户开始鼓吹与美国切断经济联系的想法，他们认为中国可以单干。就连文化交流也成了攻击目标，有的用户攻击素食主义是舶来品，或批评穿和服玩角色扮演的人。
"Mr. Wang a self-declared fan of American TV, especially ""Westworld"" and ""Game of Thrones"" began worrying that many Chinese had swung too far, from self-deprecation to imagined invincibility. He admitted to having been overly optimistic himself about the pace of China's development in his earlier writings, and said the country was still not as powerful as the United States.",自称是美剧迷的王小东尤其爱看《西部世界》和《权力游戏》，他开始担心许多中国人已走向另一个极端，从自卑走向了想象中的无敌。他承认自己在早期文章中对中国发展的速度过于乐观，他说，中国仍然不如美国强大。
"""Before, Chinese people's self-esteem was too low, and they thought China couldn't do anything right,"" Mr. Wang said. ""Now, they think China is No. 1 and can fight anyone and I can't take that either. China isn't that strong yet.""","""那个时候过分自卑，说中国什么都不行，""王小东说。""现在他们认为中国是第一了，打谁都行，这个也是我不能接受的。中国没有强大到这个样子。"""
"As had become his habit, he aired those views on the Twitter-like platform Weibo, where he has 2.5 million followers.",王小东已经形成了习惯，在他拥有250万关注者的微博上发表了这些看法。
"Last December, he posted a video arguing that China should do whatever was necessary to remain part of global trade, even if that meant enduring some humiliation.",去年12月，他发布了一段视频，主张中国应该尽量保持参与全球贸易，即使这意味着要忍辱负重。
"""I used to express some different views,"" Mr. Wang acknowledged in the video, seated before his usual backdrop of elegant carved wooden cabinets. But, he continued, ""we really haven't gotten to the point where we win at everything we do.""","王小东在视频中承认:""我曾经在那个时代表达了一些不同的观点。""他坐在雕刻精致的木质陈列柜前，他通常将它作为视频背景。但是，他继续说，""我们真的还没到那个所谓的什么动不动就赢，赢两次的那个时候。"""
"This summer, after some social media users predicted that China would shoot down House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's plane to Taiwan, Mr. Wang said too much bluster made China appear weak.",今年夏天，在一些社交媒体用户预测中国将击落众议院议长南希·佩洛西飞往台湾的飞机后，王小东表示，过多的叫嚣使中国显得软弱。
"In turn, he is tarred by commenters as an arrogant has-been, and he seems to relish hitting back, with condescension. When one user told Mr. Wang to go to America, he responded, ""Idiots like you not only lack brains, you also lack morals.""","然而，他被评论者指责为傲慢的过气人物，他似乎享受以居高临下的方式进行反击。当一位用户叫王小东去美国时，他回答说:""你们这种傻缺不仅缺脑子还缺德。"""
"There is one notable omission from his list of targets. He almost never criticizes the government, which arguably has done more than anybody to foment nationalism, through its aggressive ""Wolf Warrior"" diplomacy and disinformation campaigns about foreign countries.","他回击的目标清单有一个明显的遗漏。他几乎从不批评政府，可以说，通过侵略性的""战狼""外交和关于外国的虚假宣传活动，政府在煽动民族主义方面做得比任何人都多。"
"Mr. Wang said he deliberately avoided direct commentary on domestic politics, focusing instead on social media users' reactions to certain issues, because he worried about his social media accounts being shut down; he earns money through paid subscribers. He now tries to comment more on international affairs. Many of his latest videos are about the war in Ukraine. ""I'm actually quite timid,"" he joked.","王小东说，他担心自己的社交媒体帐户被关闭，因此特意避免直接评论国内政治，而是关注社交媒体用户对某些问题的反应。他通过付费订阅者赚钱。他现在试图更多地评论国际事务。他的许多最新视频都是关于乌克兰战争的。""我是很胆小的一个人，""他开玩笑说。"
"Still, if Mr. Wang comes off as moderate today, that is perhaps only because of how extreme Chinese online nationalists have become. He still champions a superpower China; his quibble is over tactics and timing. At times, he has joined the online masses in mobilizing against the West, such as when he cheered a boycott of Nike and H&M for swearing off Xinjiang cotton.",然而，如果王小东现在看上去温和，那可能只是因为中国网络民族主义者变得太极端了。他仍然拥护中国成为超级大国;他辩论的只是战术和时机。有时，他也加入网络群众的行列，动员起来反对西方，比如，他为抵制耐克和H&M宣誓不使用新疆棉花而欢呼。
"Song Qiang, one of Mr. Wang's four co-authors on ""China is Unhappy,"" said Chinese nationalism today was a clear descendant of the movement Mr. Wang had helped start, and shape.",宋强是王小东《中国不高兴》一书的四位合著者之一，他说，中国当今的民族主义显然是王小东帮助发起和塑造的那场运动的后裔。
"""The national awakening that began with Wang Xiaodong's criticism of 'River Elegy'"" the 1988 documentary ""has become mainstream,"" said Mr. Song, who added that he disagreed that young nationalists were irrational. ""There's no reason to say that the nationalism inherited by the new generation is different from that of the 1990s.""","宋强说:""王小东从质疑《河殇》开始的民族觉醒，在网络时代成为一种主流的声音。""他还说，他不同意年轻的民族主义者是非理性的。""没有理由说新生代传承的民族主义和90年代出现的有什么不一样。"""
"Still, Mr. Wang knows his popular appeal may be diminishing, given how the broader political climate rewards more aggressive chest-thumping than he might think wise.",不过，王小东知道，鉴于更广泛的政治气候青睐更激进的表忠心，他的热度可能正在下降。
But he believes his views will retain an audience at least for now.,但他相信他的观点会留住一些受众——至少现在是这样。
"""Let's put it this way: Right now, it's my generation that's in charge, not theirs,"" he said of younger Chinese. ""We'll see what happens after we die.""","""应该是这么说，现在是我们这代人——不是他们这代人，还在掌权吧，""他谈到年轻的中国人时说。""等我们死了再说吧。"""
"A Covid-19 outbreak at the largest iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, China, has forced some factory workers into quarantine, part of a citywide outbreak that has also prompted shops and hotels near the factory to close.",中国郑州全市暴发新冠疫情，波及到当地最大的iPhone制造厂，一些工人被迫隔离，也导致工厂附近的商店和酒店停业。
"Foxconn, a major manufacturer for Apple, confirmed in a statement to The New York Times on Thursday that a ""small number of employees"" had been asked to quarantine, but declined to comment on details of the outbreak.","苹果的主要制造商富士康周四在给《纽约时报》的一份声明中证实，""少数员工""已被要求进行隔离，但拒绝透露疫情的详细情况。"
"Foxconn, with headquarters in Taiwan, said efforts to control the outbreak were ""progressing steadily"" and that the quarantined employees were being provided with what they needed, including ""material supplies, psychological comfort and responsive feedback.""","总部位于台湾的富士康表示，""正在稳步推进""疫情防控工作，被隔离员工的需求也得到了满足，包括""物资供给、心理抚慰、诉求反馈""。"
"The outbreak comes at an inopportune time for Apple and Foxconn, which is now making the new iPhone 14. Foxconn said that production and operations were ""relatively stable,"" and that output estimates for the three-month period from October to December would ""remain unchanged.""","对于苹果和正在生产新款iPhone 14的富士康而言，此次疫情来得不是时候。富士康表示，生产运营都""相对稳定""，10月至12月的三个月产量将""展望不变""。"
"This part of the year is typically a critical period for iPhones. Last year, roughly a third of the $192 billion in iPhone sales was generated in the holiday period alone, according to Apple. The phone helped increase total revenue by 8 percent in the latest quarter, the company reported on Thursday.",每年这个时间段通常都是iPhone制造的关键期。据苹果称，在去年1920亿美元的iPhone销售额中，大约三分之一是在节日季产生的。该公司周四报告称，这款iPhone在最近一季度让苹果总营收增长了8%。
"Called ""iPhone City"" by locals, Zhengzhou is a city of six million people in inland China. It is a central artery in Apple's production of the iPhone, producing roughly half of Apple's global supply, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, a financial services group.","被当地人称为""苹果城""的郑州是一座拥有600万人口的中国内陆城市。金融服务集团天风国际证券的分析师郭明錤表示，郑州是苹果的iPhone生产重地，约占苹果全球供应量的一半。"
"""What happens if this hits other Chinese cities where Apple has supply chains?"" he said. ""It's definitely something that Apple needs to consider in the mid-to-long term.""","""你如果继续都封城，会不会哪一天封到苹果其他的产线?所以对苹果来说，""他说。""这个算是一个中长期要注意的一个点。"""
"Apple has moved production of some of its next-generation iPhones to India, a shift in response to growing awareness of heightened risks caused by concentrating manufacturing in a single country.",苹果已将下一代的部分iPhone生产转移到印度，因为该公司愈发认识到，将生产集中在一个国家会增加风险。
The Zhengzhou city government said that neighborhoods in several of the city's 12 districts are under some form of restrictions.,郑州市政府表示，在全市12个区中，有好几个区都受到了某种形式的限制。
"Those restrictions were imposed against the backdrop of last week's Communist Party congress that extended Xi Jinping's leadership for a precedent-defying third term. Under Mr. Xi's direction, China has stuck with a zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic marked by mass testing, severe lockdowns, and quarantines that has shut down entire cities because of a handful of cases. Some people have had trouble securing food, and some have been confined for weeks in poorly built isolation facilities.","这些限制是在上周中共二十大召开的背景下实施的，这场大会将习近平的统治延长至打破先例的第三任期。在习近平的指挥下，中国坚持对疫情采取""清零""方针——大规模检测、严厉封锁和隔离——少数感染就会导致整座城市的封锁。有些人难以获取食物，有些人被关在简陋的隔离设施里长达数周时间。"
"Gao Mingjun, 24, a Zhengzhou resident, said her mother and aunt have been quarantined in their dormitories in the Foxconn Zhengzhou factory for weeks.",24岁的郑州居民高明君(音)说，她的母亲和姨妈已经在富士康郑州工厂的宿舍被隔离了数周。
"""I haven't seen my Mom for more than a month,"" she said, adding, ""there are basically no advantages, but all are flaws,"" with the pandemic restrictions.","""我已经一个多月没见到我妈了，""她说，并表示疫情限制，""根本没什么好处，只有问题。"""
"Though financial markets have signaled unease with China's economic slowdown, local governments have hewed closely to Mr. Xi's playbook. At his opening address at the congress, Mr. Xi reiterated his commitment to China's pandemic policy, describing the fight against Covid as an ""all-out war.""","尽管金融市场已经发出对中国经济放缓感到不安的信号，但地方政府仍严格按照习近平的策略行事。在二十大开幕致辞中，习近平重申了他对中国防疫政策的坚持，将抗击新冠疫情描述为一场""总体战""。"
"Several other cities have been battling outbreaks in recent weeks, including Wuhan, where the virus first appeared; Lanzhou, in Gansu province; and Xining in the northwestern province of Qinghai. The latest viral wave, which reached 993 cases on Thursday, followed earlier outbreaks at the start of October in western Xinjiang and southern Hainan, among other places, when daily cases reached 1,400.",最近几周，其他多个城市也在与疫情作斗争，包括病毒首次出现的武汉市;甘肃省兰州市;西北青海省的西宁市。周四的最近一次病例激增达到993例，此前西部的新疆和南部的海南在10月初遭遇疫情，当时每天报告的病例数达到了1400例。
"The lockdown in Zhengzhou began early last week when people in more than a dozen neighborhoods in the central Zhongyuan district, west of the Foxconn factory, were told to stay at home, according to an official notice. By Tuesday, images and videos of an outbreak inside Foxconn erupted on social media, sparking outrage from Chinese internet users who accused the company of failing to be transparent and downplaying the situation. The hashtag #ZhengzhouFoxconn briefly trended on Weibo, a popular social media platform in China.","根据一份官方通报，郑州的封锁始于上周初，当时位于该市中部中原区十几个街道的民众都被告知待在家中，那里就在富士康工厂的西边。到周二，富士康内部流出的图片和视频在社交媒体上疯传，引发了中国网民的愤怒，他们指责该公司隐瞒事实，淡化情况。""#郑州富士康""的话题一度上了中国热门社交平台微博的热搜。"
But some online commenters were relieved that the news had finally emerged. Posts revealed shortages of food and other necessities inside workers' dormitories.,不过，情况最终被曝光还是让一些网友感到欣慰。发到网上的内容显示，工人宿舍内食物和其他必需品都存在短缺的情况。
"A protester unfurled two banners on a highway overpass in central Beijing on Oct. 13, denouncing Xi Jinping as a ""despotic traitor."" China's censors went to great lengths to scrub the internet of any reference to the act of dissent, prohibiting all discussion and shutting down many offending social media accounts.","10月13日，一名抗议者在北京市中心的一座立交桥上打出了两条横幅，谴责习近平是""独裁国贼""。中国的审查人员竭尽全力删掉了网上提及该抗议行为的内容，禁止所有相关讨论，还封了许多违规者的社交媒体帐号。"
"The slogans didn't go away. Instead, they caught on inside and outside China, online and offline.",但抗议标语并没有因此而消失。它们反而在中国境内境外，以及线上线下传播开来。
"Encouraged by the Beijing protester's extremely rare display of courage, young Chinese are using creative ways to spread the banners' anti-Xi messages. They graffitied the slogans in public toilets in China. They used Apple's AirDrop feature to send photos of the messages to fellow passengers' iPhones in subway cars. They posted the slogans on university campuses all over the world. They organized chat groups to bond and shouted ""Remove Xi Jinping"" in front of Chinese embassies. This all happened while the Communist Party was convening an all-important congress in Beijing and putting forth an image of a country singularly united behind a great leader.","中国的年轻人受到了北京这名抗议者极为罕见的勇敢表现所鼓舞，正在用充满创意的方式传播横幅上的反习信息。他们把抗议标语涂鸦在公共厕所里;用苹果产品的隔空投送功能，把抗议标语的图片发给地铁车厢里其他乘客的iPhone上;在世界各地的大学校园张贴标语海报;组织聊天群加强联系，在中国大使馆前高喊""罢免习近平""。这一切都发生在中国共产党在北京召开一次非常重要的全国代表大会、展现在伟大领袖领导下紧密团结的国家形象之际。"
"The aftermath of the Beijing protest ""made me feel, for the first time, hopeful,"" said an organizer of an Instagram account known as Citizens Daily CN, which posts photo submissions of sightings of anti-Xi messages. ""In this era of oppressive silence, there's anger in silence, hope in despair.""","北京抗议活动的出现""让我最明显的感觉不是艰难，而是有希望""，参与管理Instagram""公民日报""帐号的人说。这个帐号专门发布人们看到的反习信息的照片。""这么'万马齐喑'的时代，其实静默中也有愤怒，绝望中也有希望。"""
"Young people like him are emerging as unexpected rebels against Mr. Xi, who over the weekend became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong by securing a norm-breaking third term and stuffing the party's leadership with loyalists.",像他这样的年轻人正在出人意料地成为反习叛逆者。习近平是中国自毛泽东以来权力最大的领导人，上周末，他获得了打破常规的第三个任期，而且把中共领导层全部变成了自己的亲信。
"While there has always been political dissent in China, the country's Generation Zers are known for toeing the government line, both because they grew up in China's most prosperous period and because the party is very good at using the internet and social media for indoctrination.",尽管中国一直存在政治异见，但中国的Z世代以听政府的话而闻名，这是因为他们成长于中国最繁荣的时期，也是因为中共非常善于利用互联网和社交媒体进行思想灌输。
"Now, though, some of them are experiencing a quiet political awakening, having grown unhappy about the government's comprehensive censorship, the harsh ""zero Covid"" policy and the ever-tightening grip on society.","但现在，由于对政府的全面审查、严厉的""新冠清零""政策，以及对社会不断收紧的控制感到不满，他们中的一些人正在悄悄经历一场政治觉醒。"
"The vast majority of the young dissenters are having their first brush with political rebellion, which is prohibited in China and closely monitored by the authorities, even as a Chinese person living abroad. In doing so, they're overcoming their fear of the repressive government, their political depression and their loneliness as political heretics in a society that espouses one leader, one party and one ideology.",对绝大多数年轻异见者来说，这是他们第一次触及政治反抗，这种反抗在中国是被禁止的，而且受到当局的严密监控，哪怕你是居住在海外的中国人。在这样做的过程中，他们正在克服对专制政府的恐惧和政治上的压抑感，以及在只拥护一名领导人、一个政党和一种意识形态的社会里，作为政治异端的孤独感。
"As beginner protesters, they're timid, scared and inexperienced. They are ashamed that they have to ask for anonymity in media interviews and even hide their identities from each other. (All the people interviewed for this column requested anonymity for fear of punishment by the Chinese authorities.) The risks are too high. But being part of the global anti-Xi protest movement empowers them.",他们是抗议新手，胆小、害怕，也缺乏经验。他们对于在接受采访时提出不具名的要求感到羞愧，他们甚至对彼此隐瞒身份。(因为害怕中国政府，本文所有受访者都要求不具名)反抗的风险太高。但成为全球反习抗议运动的一员又让他们有一种获得力量的感觉。
"By sharing the protest posters online, many people realized that they were not alone in their political thinking. ""It comforts people and gives them hope,"" said the administrator of the Instagram account @northern_square, an art student in the United States. The account has received more than 2,000 submissions from all over the world of sightings of anti-Xi messages. Citizens Daily CN said that by Sunday it had received more than 1,500 submissions of anti-Xi slogan sightings from more than 328 universities around the world.","通过在网上分享抗议海报，许多人意识到，他们并不是唯一有这种政治想法的人。""它会给人宽慰和希望，""上述Instagram帐号的管理员、在美国学习艺术专业的""北方广场""说道。该帐号已收到人们在世界各地看到的2000多个反习信息的图片。公民日报称，截至周日，已收到来自全球328多所大学的1500多份反习标语目击报告。"
"In a sign of the risks these people are taking, Citizens Daily CN's organizers and volunteers, mostly living outside China, remain anonymous even to each other.",公民日报的组织者和志愿者大多居住在中国境外，他们甚至不知道彼此的真实姓名，由此可见这些人所承担的风险。
"The Beijing protester is now viewed as a hero and an inspiration among many Chinese. He was last seen being detained by the police on the Sitong Bridge overpass. His identity still unverified, he's being called the ""Bridge Man,"" a reference to the ""Tank Man,"" who stood in front of tanks during the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in 1989.","北京的那名抗议者现已被许多中国人视为英雄和鼓舞人心的人。人们最后一次看到他是在四通桥上被警方带走的情景。他的身份仍未得到证实，他被称为""四通桥人""(Bridge Man)，这一称呼仿照了""坦克人""，后者指的是1989年北京血腥镇压民主示威者时，站出来挡住坦克前行的那个人。"
"His banners contained a list of accusations against Mr. Xi's rule over the past decade, during which the autocratic leader severely restricted freedom of speech, walked back economic reforms and subjected 1.4 billion Chinese to mandatory participation in the zero-Covid policy, which has thrown the country into social, economic and political chaos.",他挂出来的横幅对习近平过去十年的统治进行了一系列声讨，这名专制领导人在其统治期间严格限制言论自由，放弃经济改革，还强迫14亿中国人接受新冠清零政策，该政策让国家陷入了社会、经济和政治混乱。
"Mr. Xi has all but silenced nearly everyone inside the country who has ever spoken up to him, from activists to business leaders to academics, sentencing some of them to long jail terms. His propaganda machine has been in high gear, brainwashing China's young generation. People who thought independently either learned to shut up or were forced to emigrate.",习近平还让国内几乎所有曾敢于发表反对意见的人噤声，他们包括活动人士、商界领袖和学者，其中一些人被判以长期监禁。习近平的宣传机器一直在高速运转，对中国的年轻一代进行洗脑。独立思考者要么学乖了、不再发声，要么被迫移民。
"A university student in Guangzhou told me that he was stunned by the courage of the ""Bridge Man."" He wants more Chinese to learn about what the man has done. Several times in the past week, he boarded subways and used his iPhone's AirDrop function to share photos about the protest and instructions on how to download virtual private network software to bypass China's censorship.","广州的一名大学生告诉我，""四通桥人""的勇气使他震惊。他想让更多的中国人知道这个人干了什么。过去一周，他多次在地铁使用iPhone的隔空投送功能，分享四通桥抗议照片，还分享教人如何下载虚拟专用网络软件，以绕过审查制度的指南。"
"""The first step to end the Communist Party rule is to wake up the people,"" he said. He believes that accessing uncensored information can help break the spell of indoctrination.","他说，""结束共产党的统治第一步是让这些人觉醒。""他认为，能看到未经审查的信息有助于打破思想灌输的紧箍咒。"
"This semester he has to spend three afternoons a week in ideology classes, including one that teaches students how to think about current affairs, such as U.S.-China relations and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With the censorship and brainwashing, it's very hard to wake people up, he said.",这个学期，他每周要花三个下午上思想教育课程，包括教学生如何思考时事(比如美中关系和俄罗斯入侵乌克兰)的课程。他说，由于审查和洗脑，唤醒人们很困难。
"He was scared when he boarded the subway, he said. He wore a mask, as required by the Guangzhou metro's Covid policies, and found a place where he could use his jacket to keep his phone screen from being seen by surveillance cameras or other passengers. He said more than 20 people had accepted his photos via AirDrop. But he also got an unexpected response from a fellow passenger who sent a photo with the sentence, ""China doesn't need smart cookies.""","他说，刚在地铁上做这些事情的时候很害怕。他按照广州的地铁防疫政策要求戴上了口罩，找到一个能用夹克将手机屏幕挡住、不让监控摄像头或其他乘客看到的地方。他说，已有20多人通过隔空投送接受了他发的图片，但也收到了一份意外回复，有人发给他一张写着""中国不需要聪明人""的照片。"
"""The passenger was mocking me that what I was doing was futile,"" he said.","""TA在笑我，这样做是无意义的，""他说。"
"For Kathy, a Chinese student in London, political apathy like this is what upsets her the most. Out of her 30-plus undergraduate classmates back in Beijing, she could talk about politics to only one of them. The others either showed no interest or disapproved of her critical views of the government.",对在伦敦读书的中国学生凯西来说，这种政治冷漠是最让她不快的东西。她只能和她在北京读大学时的30多个同学中的少数人谈论政治。其他同学要么没兴趣，要么不赞成她对政府的批评意见。
"""They are usually normal people, even kind,"" she said. Then they would become nationalistic ""robots"" when something like Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan visit happened, she said. ""As if a program embedded in the robots was turned on, everyone started posting the same horrible language on social media,"" she said.","""他们其实很多时候是一个正常人，甚至是好人，""她说。但每当有美国众议院议长佩洛西访台之类的事情发生时，他们会变成民族主义""机器人""，她说。""他们就像是机器人体内程序的设定突然发作了，然后发一些你觉得非常恐怖的话，""她说。"
"When she saw photos of the protest in Beijing, she was awed by the ""Bridge Man's"" courage, too. Then she started seeing people posting sightings of anti-Xi slogans in many parts of the world.","看到四通桥的抗议照片时，她也被""四通桥人""的勇气所震撼。然后她开始看到人们上传到网上的在世界各地看到反习口号的图片。"
"She started to cry and couldn't stop for hours, she said.",她忍不住哭了起来，哭了几个小时，她说。
"As the photos of the protest posters kept coming in, she felt she saw a little light in the darkness. She's not alone anymore.",随着抗议海报图片不断上传，她觉得在黑暗中看到了一丝曙光。她不再孤单。
"""I thought to myself that there are many Chinese who also want freedom and democracy,"" she said. ""But where are you? Where can I find you? If we meet on the street, how can we recognize each other?""","""我就想有很多想要自由，想要民主的中国人，""她说。 ""但是你们到底在哪里?我到底该怎么找到你呢?我们走在街上又怎么能够认出彼此? """
"At about 4 the next morning, she went downstairs from her dorm room to print some posters. She was nervous about running into other Chinese students, most of whom she would describe as ""little pinks,"" or pro-Beijing youths. She wore a mask to avoid cameras, even though she had seldom worn one since arriving in London a few weeks ago.","第二天早上4点左右，她从寝室下楼去打印了一些海报。她担心遇到其他中国学生，她说大多数中国学生都是""小粉红""。为了避开摄像头，她带上了口罩，尽管自她几周前抵达伦敦以来，很少戴口罩。"
"She was even more nervous putting up the posters on campus. Every time she saw an East Asian face, she would run to hide in a corridor or a restroom. She was afraid they could report her to the embassy or post photos of her on social media. Her parents are still in China, so she needs to take their safety into account.",她在校园里张贴海报时更加紧张。每次看到东亚面孔，她都会跑到走廊或洗手间躲起来。她担心他们会向大使馆举报她或在社交媒体上发布她的照片。她的父母还在中国，所以她需要考虑到他们的安全。
"After putting up the posters all over her campus, she felt much more at peace with herself.",将海报贴满校园后，她的内心平静了许多。
"A week later, when a new chat group titled ""'My Duty' Democracy Wall in London"" was set up on the messaging app Telegram, Kathy was one of the first to join. Within a day, more than 200 Chinese had also signed up. By Sunday, four days later, there were more than 400 members. Most introduced themselves as students and professionals in the U.K. Many said they had joined to find like-minded people because they, like Kathy, didn't know whom to trust and felt lonely and powerless.","一周后，当消息应用程序Telegram上建立了一个名为""'我的义务'伦敦民主墙""的新聊天群时，凯西是第一批加入的人之一。还有200多名中国人在一天之内报名加入。到了四天后的星期日已超过400人。大多数人介绍自己是英国的学生和专业人士。许多人说，他们加入是为了寻找志同道合的人，因为他们和凯西一样，不知道该信任谁，感到孤独和无能为力。"
"Citizens Daily CN, the Instagram account, organized Telegram chat groups in London, New York, Toronto and two other places to provide a safe online space for overseas Chinese to exchange views. Most people use online handles that disguise their identity.","Instagram帐号""公民日报""组织了在伦敦、纽约、多伦多和另外两个地方的Telegram聊天群，为海外华人提供安全的网上交流空间。大多数人使用隐藏身份的网名。"
"They have discussed the depths of their frustration with political apathy and the best way to deal with pro-Beijing youth. Quite a few admitted that they were once nationalistic themselves, but added that China's harsh zero-Covid policy had made them realize the importance of having a government accountable to its people. More important, they discussed what further actions they could take.",他们讨论对政治冷漠的挫败感，以及与小粉红打交道的最佳方式。不少人承认，他们自己也曾是民族主义者，但补充说，中国严厉的清零政策使他们意识到，拥有一个对人民负责的政府的重要性。更重要的是，他们讨论了可以采取的进一步行动。
"On Sunday, Kathy, who is in her early 20s, joined a demonstration for the first time in her life. For safety, she wore a mask and sunglasses, even though it was dark when the protest reached the Chinese Embassy in London. A young Chinese woman started chanting slogans made popular by the Bridge Man: ""Students, workers, let's strike. Depose the despotic traitor Xi Jinping.""","周日，20岁出头的凯西有生以来第一次参加了示威活动。为了安全起见，她戴着口罩和太阳镜，尽管抗议活动到达中国驻伦敦大使馆时天已经黑了。一位年轻的中国女性开始高呼因四通桥上的""四通桥人""而流传开来的口号:""罢课，罢工，罢免独裁国贼习近平。"""
"Kathy and a few other Chinese students repeated after her. Just uttering those words gave her goose bumps. She shivered and cried. ""Fear never felt so strong and so real in my life,"" she said. Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators cheered them on.","凯西和其他几个中国学生跟着她重复。光是说出这几个字就让她起鸡皮疙瘩。她颤抖着哭了起来。""这也是我第一次感受到最真实最强烈的恐惧，""她说。有香港的民主示威者为他们加油。"
"""It was unbelievable that I shouted those words,"" Kathy said. ""I learned that courage needs practice, too. I won't be able to learn these things unless I practice them constantly.""","""第一次这么大声地喊出这些东西，难以置信，""凯西说。""勇气也是需要练习的。这些东西只有不断练习才能习得。"""
"As China's leader, Xi Jinping, laid out his priorities this week for a breakthrough third term in power, officials parsed his words for signs of where the country was headed. What he did not say was as revealing.",本周，中国领导人习近平为前所未有的第三个任期列出优先事项，官员们分析他的话，寻找国家未来走向的征兆。但他避而不谈的那些话，也同样能说明问题。
The omission of two phrases from his key report to a Communist Party congress exposed his anxieties about an increasingly volatile world where Washington is contesting China's ascent as an authoritarian superpower.,他在党代会上所做的重要报告中缺失了两个说法，暴露出他对一个日益动荡的世界的焦虑——在这个世界里，中国作为一个威权主义超级大国正在崛起，而华盛顿正在与之展开竞争。
"For two decades, successive Chinese leaders have declared at the congress that the country was in a ""period of important strategic opportunity,"" implying that China faced no imminent risk of major conflict and could focus more on economic growth.","20年来，历任中国领导人都会在党代会上宣布中国处于""重要战略机遇期""，暗示中国没有面临迫在眉睫的重大冲突，可以将注意力更多地放在经济增长上。"
"For even longer, leaders have said that ""peace and development remain the themes of the era,"" suggesting that whatever may be going wrong in the world, the grand trends were on China's side.","多年以来，领导人们还一直说""和平与发展仍是这个时代的主题""，暗示无论世界上出了什么事情，大势仍在中国这一边。"
"But the two slogans, so unvarying that they rarely drew attention, were not in Mr. Xi's report to the congress, which began last Sunday and ended Saturday. Not in his 104-minute speech summarizing the report. Nor in the 72-page Chinese full version given to officials and journalists.",这两个口号如此固定不变，以至于它们极少引起人们的注意，但它们并没有出现在习近平对大会所作的报告中，这次党代会于上周日开幕，周六结束。它们既没有出现在习近平时长104分钟、对报告内容予以总结的讲话中，也没有出现在72页发放给官员和记者的中文全文中。
"Their exclusion, and Mr. Xi's somber warning of ""dangerous storms"" on the horizon, indicated that he believed international hazards have worsened, especially since the start of the war in Ukraine in February, several experts said. Mr. Xi, who is nearly assured re-election on Sunday as its general secretary, sees a world made more treacherous by American support for the disputed island of Taiwan, Chinese vulnerability to technology ""choke points,"" and the plans of Western-led alliances to increase their military presence around Asia.","几位专家表示，这两个口号的缺失以及习近平对未来""惊涛骇浪""的严峻警告均表明他认为国际风险已经恶化，尤其是自2月份乌克兰战争开打以来。习近平周日再次连任几乎已成定局(本文英文版发表于周六——编注)，在他看来，由于美国对争议岛屿台湾的支持、中国在技术""阻塞点""方面的脆弱，以及西方牵头的联盟在亚洲周边提升军事存在的计划，令这个世界危机重重。"
"""China's external environment now can be described as unprecedentedly perilous, and that's also the judgment of China's high echelon,"" Hu Wei, a foreign policy scholar in Shanghai, said in an interview.","""现在中国的外部环境可以说是前所未有的险恶，这也是中国高层的判断，""上海一位外交政策学者胡伟接受采访时表示。"
"In the Communist Party, the leader's words matter enormously, shaping China's policies, legislation and diplomacy. And the report to the party congress, every five years, is the fundamental guide for officials. Each phrase, each tweak, each omission is weighed to signal priorities.",在党内，领导人的话至关重要，影响着中国的政策、立法和外交。对官员们来说，中国领导人每五年一次的党代会报告是基本方针。每一个表达方式、每一处调整、每一个省略都会被仔细推敲，成为优先事项的信号。
"In his report, Mr. Xi said several times that China intended to contribute more to global peace and development through its own initiatives, and discussed ""strategic opportunities"" for trade and diplomatic gains. But his assessment of global trends was laced with warnings.","报告中，习近平多次表示中国打算通过自己的倡议促进国际和平与发展，并且讨论了贸易与外交获益的""战略机遇""。但他对国际趋势的评估充满警告。"
"""Our country has entered a period when strategic opportunity coexists with risks and challenges, and uncertainties and unforeseen factors are rising,"" Mr. Xi said. Although China has room for international growth and initiative, he added, ""the world has entered a period of turbulence and transformation.""","""我国发展进入战略机遇和风险挑战并存、不确定难预料因素增多的时期，""习近平说。尽管中国有空间实现国际增长和倡议，他接着表示，""世界已进入动荡变革时期。"""
"""This marks a meaningful, and perhaps major, shift in their assessment of the global order,"" said Christopher K. Johnson, the president of the China Strategies Group and a former C.I.A. analyst of Chinese politics. ""He's basically hardening the system because the likelihood of conflict is going up.""","""这标志着他们对国际秩序的评估发生了一个意味深长的，或许十分重要的改变，""中国战略集团总裁、前CIA中国政治分析师克里斯托弗·约翰逊说。""他基本上是在强化这个体系，因为存在冲突加剧的可能。"""
"During the congress, Mr. Xi did not publicly mention the United States, nor President Biden's new national security strategy that describes China as the pre-eminent threat to American primacy. But to Chinese officials, the implied focus will be clear.",二十大期间，习近平没有公开提及美国，以及拜登的新国家安全战略。该战略将中国描绘为对美国主导地位的重大威胁。但对中国官员们来说，讲话中暗指的对象不言而喻。
"""Daring to struggle"" was a hallmark of Chinese diplomacy, a vice foreign minister, Ma Zhaoxu, told reporters covering the congress, noting Beijing's contention with overbearing, ""hegemonic"" rivals. Jiang Jinquan, a senior aide to Mr. Xi, told a Beijing newspaper that China had ""vigorously and effectively"" taken on ""hostile Western forces.""","""敢于斗争""是中国外交的一大标志，中国外交部副部长马朝旭对报道大会的记者说，他指的是北京与霸道、""霸权""敌对阵营的竞争。习近平高级助手江金权对北京的一家报纸表示，中国""有力有效""应对""西方敌对势力""。"
Mr. Xi's warnings have also reflected his underlying political message to the congress: I told you so.,习近平的警告也应和了他对大会所发出的隐含的政治信息:我早就说过会是这样。
"He has positioned himself as the prophetic statesman who in his decade-long rule beat back proliferating threats to China's rise while overhauling its fractured military and security forces. He has been the leader who toughened up China's diplomacy, foreseeing that jealous rival powers would try to, as he said in his report, ""blackmail, contain, blockade and exert maximum pressure on China.""","他将自己定位为有先见之明的治国之才，在他长达十年的统治期间，击退了针对中国崛起不断激增的威胁，同时还改革了这个国家四分五裂的军事与安全力量。他是让中国外交强硬起来的领导人，正如他在报告中说的一样，他预见了充满嫉妒的对手国家会尝试""外部勒索、遏制、封锁和极限施压""。"
"The party is promoting Mr. Xi as the nation's ""navigator"" for the intensifying threats. The outcome of the congress on Saturday made clear that Mr. Xi will stay in power beyond the 10 years his predecessor served, and also install a new leadership team dominated by his firm allies.","共产党正在将习近平宣传为应对不断加剧的威胁的国家""领路人""。周六的会议结果明确表明，习近平掌权的时间将超越其前任的10年任期，并且还将安置一个由其亲信主导的新领导班子。"
"That new team, to be unveiled on Sunday, is likely to elevate officials whom Mr. Xi believes will serve his call to ""struggle,"" by their loyalty to him and the party, and their ability to advance programs to upgrade high-tech, military modernization and social controls.","这个新团队在周日亮相，习近平很可能会提拔那些他认为能响应其""斗争""号召的官员，他们对他、对党忠诚，具有推进高科技升级、军事现代化和社会控制项目的能力。"
"Already, People's Liberation Army commanders and senior officials at the congress have urged China to rally around Mr. Xi's plans to upgrade the military, accelerate technological self-reliance and strengthen ideological indoctrination to ward off subversive ideas among the young.",在大会上，中国人民解放军的指挥官和高级官员已经敦促国家团结起来，支持习近平在升级军队、加速科技独立自主，以及在年轻人当中加强意识形态灌输，以抵御颠覆思想的计划。
"Mr. Xi had ""carried out a historic rescue, reshaping and transformation"" of the People's Liberation Army forces, Gen. Xu Qiliang told military delegates at the congress. ""In all actions, absolutely obey the command of Chairman Xi,"" he said, using Mr. Xi's title as head of the military.","习近平""历史性挽救、重塑和再造""人民解放军，许其亮将军对大会上的军队代表说。""一切行动坚决听从习主席指挥。"""
"In his report, Mr. Xi laid out some of his plans to secure China's global rise, many building on current policy directions.",在报告中，习近平列出了一些确保中国在全球崛起的计划，其中许多都建立在当前的政策方向之上。
"He called for accelerating steps to become more self-reliant in core technologies and pressing ahead with military modernization, including, Mr. Xi hinted, upgrading China's relatively limited nuclear weapons abilities.",他呼吁在核心技术方面加快自立更生，加紧推进军事现代化，习近平暗示，其中包括升级中国较为有限的核武能力。
"Beijing, he said, would also become more active in international affairs and promote its own solutions for global security and development challenges. He repeated that China wanted to win control of Taiwan peacefully, but could use force if compelled.",他说，北京还将更积极地参与国际事务，并且为全球安全与发展挑战推行自己的解决方案。他重申，中国希望和平获得台湾的控制权，但在迫不得已的情况下可能会动用武力。
"Mr. Xi's new phrases had signaled that China must become more nimble, Wang Wen, the executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies in Beijing, said in written responses to questions.",习近平的新说法表明中国必须变得更加灵活，中国人民大学重阳金融研究院执行院长王文接受书面采访时表示。
"""We can't just passively sit back and enjoy a 'period' of strategic opportunity,"" he said, ""and have to actively shape and seize more opportunities.""","""其实意思是不要被动去享受战略机遇'期'，""他说，""而要主动去创造，抓住更多的战略机遇。"""
Mr. Xi's report also represented another step in jettisoning language and assumptions from China's era of market changes and friendly diplomacy with the West.,习近平的报告还表明，中国在抛弃市场变革和对西方友好外交时代的的措辞和设想方面，又迈进了一步。
"The phrase that ""peace and development"" were era-defining themes took hold in the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping's generation of leaders introduced economic liberalization and fostered ties with Washington, Tokyo and other former foes, said Yong Deng, a political science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who wrote ""China's Strategic Opportunity.""","《中国的战略机遇》(China's Strategic Opportunity)一书的作者、美国海军学院政治学教授邓勇说，""和平与发展""这个说法曾经是定义上世纪80年代的主题，当时邓小平那一代领导人引入了经济自由化，并与华盛顿、东京和其他昔日的敌人开始搞好关系。"
"It implied that China ""had the permissible international environment to focus on modernizations through reforms and opening,"" he said, noting that he did not speak for the navy.","这个说法暗示着中国""有着国际环境的许可，可以通过改革和开放，专注于现代化""，他说道，并指出他并非代表海军发言。"
"Another leader, Jiang Zemin, first declared in 2002 that China could enjoy about two decades of ""strategic opportunity"" free of serious risk of major conflict soon after he had won its entry into the World Trade Organization. It was a time of expanding commerce and hopes abroad that China would increasingly liberalize, in politics as well as business. Beijing encouraged talk of China's ""peaceful rise.""","另一位领导人江泽民于2002年首次宣布——那是在中国赢得加入世界贸易组织后不久——中国可以享受20年的""战略机遇""，也就是一段没有严重风险和重大冲突的时期。那是一段贸易扩张的时期，也是外国对中国日益自由化的希望不断增加的时期，无论是在政治上还是商业上。北京则鼓励外界谈论中国的""和平崛起""。"
"Even later last year, Mr. Xi and other senior officials stuck to the formula that China was still in a time of strategic opportunity, while expressing apprehension about geopolitical and economic risks. The two slogans appeared in a textbook issued to officials in April, reflecting contents of Mr. Xi's secret national security strategy. In late August, the party's leading doctrinal journal published a speech that Mr. Xi made in 2020 that hinted at internal debate.",甚至是在去年晚些时候，习近平及其他高级官员都还坚持中国仍处于战略机遇期的一贯说法，但同时也表达了对地缘政治和经济风险的忧虑。这两个口号还出现在4月发给官员的教材中，它们体现着习近平秘密的国家安全战略内容。8月底，党内主要理论刊物刊登了一篇习近平2020年发表的讲话，暗示内部出现了辩论。
"""Now and for some time to come, our country is still in a period of important strategic opportunity,"" Mr. Xi said then. ""Today, 20 years on, how we assess this period of strategic opportunity is a major issue.""","""当前和今后一个时期，我国发展仍然处于重要战略机遇期，""习近平当时说。""在20年后的今天，对战略机遇期如何判断，是一个重大问题。"""
"Mr. Xi's worries about external risks appeared to come to head in the first half of 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and NATO's galvanization to support Kyiv, an examination of Chinese officials' speeches and policy documents indicates.",对中国官员的讲话和政策文件的查阅表明，习近平对外部风险的担忧似乎在2022年上半年出现，就在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，北约对基辅表示支持后。
"The war in Ukraine, global tensions over the coronavirus pandemic and Washington's tough approach to Beijing intensified debate in China about whether it still had a ""period of strategic opportunity,"" said Mr. Wang, who recently published a paper on the issue.","乌克兰的战争、围绕着新冠病毒大流行的全球紧张态势，以及华盛顿对北京的强硬态度在中国导致辩论激化，围绕的内容便是是否中国还有""战略机遇期""，近期就该问题发表了一篇论文的王文说道。"
"""The impact from Russia-Ukraine was that it was a rehearsal for U.S. containment of China,"" Mr. Wang said in written answers to questions, reflecting a widespread view in China.","""俄乌影响就是美国遏制中国的预演，""王文在书面采访中表示，这也反映了中国的一种普遍看法。"
"Mr. Xi flagged in a speech in late July that his views had significantly changed to prepare officials for the congress. China still has many opportunities for growth, he said, but he also noted the ""dangers and challenges"" ahead.","7月底，习近平在一次讲话中表明他的观点已发生大幅转变，以便让官员们为二十大做好准备。他说，中国仍旧有许多增长机遇，但也指出了未来的""危险和挑战""。"
"""While some of China's responses to growing challenges were no doubt already underway before the congress,"" said David Gitter, the president of the Center for Advanced China Research, ""the dropping of the terms noted will inject new impetus and assertiveness in a way visible from outside China.""","""虽然中国对不断增长的挑战的一些回应，无疑在党代会之前就已经开始了，""中国高等研究中心总裁戴维·吉特尔说，""放弃这些说法将以一种在中国之外可见的方式注入新的动力和自信。"""
"Mr. Xi's draft report to the congress was endorsed by its nearly 2,400 delegates on Saturday, but the finalized version was not immediately released. There is still some chance that the reassuring stock phrases will be restored in the final version. But making that change now could signify elite discord over a major issue, something that Mr. Xi would not welcome.",习近平向大会所作报告在周六得到了2400名代表的认可，但全文版本没有立即公布。这些令人感到放心的常用语仍有可能回到最终版本中。但现在做这一改动将表明精英内部就一个重大问题出现了分歧，这是习近平所不乐见的。
"The congress issued a concluding statement praising Mr. Xi's government for, among other things, leading China in ""effectively responding to grave and complicated international circumstances, and massive risks and challenges that have followed hard on the heels of each other.""","大会发布了一份总结陈词，称赞习近平的政府""有效应对严峻复杂的国际形势和接踵而至的巨大风险挑战""。"
No one expected that a woman would join Xi Jinping's inner circle this week when he announced his new leadership team.,本周，当习近平宣布新的领导班子时，没有人期待他的核心圈子会出现女性面孔。
"But many China watchers were surprised when not a single woman was promoted to the Politburo, the party's second-most powerful group and its executive policymaking body, a break with a two-decade tradition.",但令许多中国观察人士感到惊讶的是，也没有一名女性进入政治局，这打破了过去20年的传统。政治局是中国的第二大权力集团及其执行决策机构。
"""It does certainly send a message that the Chinese Communist Party does not have an interest in advancing women's political status,"" said Minglu Chen, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney who studies gender and politics in China.","悉尼大学研究中国性别与政治的高级讲师陈明璐(音)说:""这确实发出了一个信息，即中共对提高女性的政治地位没有兴趣。"""
"""The Chinese Communist Party really is still a patriarchal institution,"" Ms. Chen said.","她表示:""中共确实还是一个男性主宰的政党。"""
"In his speech at the opening of Communist Party congress last Sunday, Mr. Xi pledged to ""adhere to the basic state policy of gender equality."" Yet when it comes to promoting women into positions of power, the party has a poor record.","上周日，习近平在共产党代表大会开幕式的讲话中承诺，""坚持男女平等的基本国策""。然而，在提拔女性担任权力职位方面，该党几乎毫无建树。"
"A woman has never been on its highest decision-making body, the Standing Committee. In the party's seven-decade history, eight women have made it close, sitting on the larger Politburo.",从未有女性进入最高决策机构政治局常委。在党的70年历史上，离常委会最近的女性是八名进入政治局的女性委员。
"One of those women, Sun Chunlan, had the credentials to be elevated to the Standing Committee, but she will step down from the Politburo this week, having surpassed the typical retirement age.",其中，孙春兰有资格晋升为常委，但她已经超过了通常的退休年龄，将于本周退出政治局。
"Another woman, Shen Yiqin, had been widely expected to be promoted to the Politburo to take Ms. Sun's place on the body, which now has 24 members. Ms. Shen was promoted to the 205-member Central Committee, along with 11 other women.",政治局目前有24名委员，外界曾普遍预计，接替孙春兰升任政治局委员的另一名女性将是谌贻琴。但谌贻琴只与其他11名女性一起进入中央委员会，该委员会有205名委员。
"While there has never been an explicit rule that there must be a woman on the Politburo, for two decades it has always had at least one female representative. The last time a woman was not promoted to the Politburo was during the 15th Communist Party congress in 1997. .",虽然从来没有明确规定政治局必须有一名女性，但20年来始终至少有一名女性代表。上一次没有女性进入政治局是在1997年的中共十五大期间。
"Ms. Shen might have made for a strong voice there, had she been promoted. She is the only woman to hold the title of provincial party secretary and is one of just four Chinese women to have ever secured that role. She is also a member of the Bai ethnic minority group, the kind of unofficial qualification that has tended to put female candidates on a fast track.",如果谌贻琴进入了政治局，她可能会在那里发出有力的声音。她是唯一一位担任省委书记职务的女性，仅有四名中国女性担任过这一职位。她还是一名白族人，这种非正式条件往往更有利于女性候选人的提拔。
"Chinese state media has not covered Ms. Shen often, but in one rare appearance in 2020, she demonstrated humility when accepting her promotion to party chief of Guizhou Province. ""I solemnly promise that I will treat comrades honestly and will never act like a patriarch who calls all the shots,"" Ms. Shen was quoted as saying in local state media at the time.","中国官方媒体对谌贻琴的报道并不多，但在2020年罕见的一次露面中，她在接受贵州省委书记的任命时表现谦逊。当时当地官方媒体援引谌贻琴的话说:""我郑重承诺，我一定真诚对待同志，决不搞一言堂、家长制。"""
"There were other strong female contenders for a position on the Politburo: Yu Hongqiu, the only woman among eight deputies at the Communist Party's anti-corruption body, and Shen Yueyue, president of the All China Women's Federation. Only Ms. Shen was promoted to the Central Committee this weekend.",政治局本来还有其他强有力的女性竞争者:中共反腐机构八名代表中唯一的女性喻红秋和全国妇联主席沈跃跃。本周末，只有谌贻琴被提拔为中央委员。
"With little female representation in government, some women's issues are likely to continue to be seen as a direct challenge to the party leadership. A sudden outburst of feminist discussion and support for victims of sexual assault, for example, has been swiftly extinguished over the past few years.",由于政府中的女性代表很少，一些女性问题可能会继续被视为对党的领导的直接挑战。例如，在过去几年中，突然爆发的女权主义讨论和对性侵犯受害者的支持很快就被扑灭了。
"In the United States and Europe, #Metoo claims have forced politicians out of office, but in China they are censored. When the tennis star Peng Shuai accused a top Chinese official of sexual assault, she was silenced by censors and disappeared for several weeks.","在美国和欧洲，""我也是""主张已迫使一些政客下台，但在中国，这一运动遭受审查。当网球明星彭帅指控一名中国高级官员性侵时，她被审查员噤声并消失了数周。"
"Zhang Gaoli, the now-retired official she accused, has not been cast aside by the party. He was given a prominent seat at the opening of the 20th party congress in the front row.",被她指控的高官是现已退休的张高丽，党并没有将他弃置一旁。在二十大开幕式上，他被安排坐在前排一个显眼的位置上。
"Xi Jinping, China's top leader, has worked to turn the country into a more state-led society that often puts national security and ideology before economic growth. On Sunday, he promoted one of his closest aides to the Politburo to carry out his vision: He Lifeng.",中国最高领导人习近平一直致力于将中国转变为一个更加由国家主导的社会，经常将国家安全和意识形态置于经济增长之上。周日，他提拔了最亲密的助手之一——何立峰进入政治局，以实现他的愿景。
"Together with Li Qiang, who is in line to become China's new premier, Mr. He will be responsible for addressing some of China's most serious challenges. Debt is high, the housing market has slumped, young people face widespread unemployment and the country faces growing political friction with crucial export markets in Europe and North America.",何立峰将与即将成为新总理的李强一起，负责应对中国面临的一些最严峻的挑战。债务居高不下，房地产市场下滑，年轻人面临大规模失业，与欧美重要出口市场面临越来越多的政治摩擦。
"Some of Mr. Xi's policies to reinforce the authority of the Communist Party and the state have worsened these problems. A broad regulatory crackdown has triggered job losses in the tech and education sectors, and has prompted many entrepreneurs to flee the country.",习近平加强共产党和国家权威的一些政策使这些问题更加恶化。广泛的监管打击导致了科技和教育部门的失业潮，并促使许多企业家逃往国外。
"Mr. Xi and Mr. He have worked together off and on since 1985, when they were officials in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, an early experiment in free markets in southeastern China's Fujian Province. Mr. He now routinely accompanies Mr. Xi on domestic and international trips.",习近平和何立峰自1985年担任厦门经济特区官员以来一直有断断续续的合作，该特区是中国东南部福建省自由市场的早期试验。何立峰现在经常陪同习近平进行国内外访问。
"""He Lifeng is one of Xi Jinping's few most trusted aides,"" said Alfred Chan, the author of a new biography of Mr. Xi and a professor emeritus at Huron University College in London, Ontario.","""何立峰是习近平为数不多的最信赖的助手之一，""习近平新传记的作者、安大略省伦敦休伦大学学院名誉教授阿尔弗雷德·陈(音)说。"
"The Communist Party Central Committee on Sunday named Mr. He, 67, to the Politburo without specifying the precise role he will play in setting the direction of China's economic policy.",周日，中共中央委员会任命67岁的何立峰为政治局委员，但没有具体说明他将在制定中国经济政策方向方面发挥的确切作用。
"Mr. Xi has also made it clear that one of his priorities is to regulate the accumulation of wealth as part of what he calls ""common prosperity,"" a sometimes vague concept of redistributing income.","习近平还明确表示，他的首要任务之一是监管财富积累，作为他所谓的""共同富裕""的一部分，这是一个并非永远那么清晰的收入再分配概念。"
"""Common prosperity requires them to do tax reform, to tax the super rich and the rich,"" said Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution in Washington.","""共同富裕需要进行税制改革，对超级富豪和富人征税，""华盛顿布鲁金斯学会中国政治专家李成说。"
"Mr. He endorsed the common prosperity goal in a column he wrote for People's Daily last year and called for China ""to increase the proportion of labor remuneration.""","何立峰去年在他为《人民日报》撰写的一篇专栏文章中支持共同富裕目标，并呼吁中国""提高劳动报酬比重""。"
"Mr. He went to work in Xiamen, in Fujian Province, in 1984 and stayed in the province until 2009, when he became deputy Communist Party secretary in Tianjin. He oversaw the construction of a vast new city of skyscrapers on Tianjin's outskirts that was intended to become an ultramodern financial district but has failed to attract many businesses and pay its many debts.",何立峰1984年到福建厦门工作，直到2009年上任天津市委副书记。分工负责一个位于天津郊区、由摩天大楼组成的巨大新区的建设，这里原本打算成为一个超现代的金融区，但未能吸引许多企业，而且欠下许多债务。
"After Mr. Xi became China's top leader in late 2012, he brought Mr. He to Beijing as deputy minister and then minister of the National Development and Reform Commission. The commission drafts China's five-year plans and has tight control over large investment projects across the country. Mr. He has also overseen the Belt and Road Initiative, a plan by Mr. Xi to develop investment links with developing countries. Many poor countries are now struggling to repay loans obtained under the project.","2012年底，习近平成为中国最高领导人后将何立峰带到北京，担任国家发展和改革委员会副主任和主任。该委员会负责起草中国的五年计划，并对全国的大型投资项目进行严格管控。何立峰还参与了""一带一路""的领导工作，这是习近平与发展中国家发展投资关系的计划。许多贫困国家现在都难以偿还通过该项目获得的贷款。"
"When China's leader, Xi Jinping, led six dark-suited men onto a bright red stage on Sunday, the scale of his victory became clear as one by one he introduced the country's new ruling inner circle. Each was an acolyte of Mr. Xi, making his grip over China's future tighter than ever.",周日，当中国领导人习近平带领六名身穿深色西装的男子走上铺着红地毯的舞台，逐一介绍新执政核心圈子的成员，他在二十大上取得的胜利规模之大显露无疑。核心圈子里的所有人都是他的嫡系，这让他对中国未来的掌控比以往任何时候都更加牢固。
"Mr. Xi's groundbreaking third term as leader, following a weeklong Communist Party congress, was entirely expected. But even seasoned observers who thought that they had taken the full measure of Mr. Xi have been astonished by how thoroughly he shook up the party's top tiers.",习近平在中国共产党为期一周的全国代表大会上史无前例地获得第三个任期，这完全在人们的意料之中。但就连那些有经验的中国观察人士也对中共最高层领导班子如此彻底的大洗牌感到震惊，他们曾认为自己已充分摸清了习近平的底细。
"""He was dominant already and is even more dominant now,"" said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago who researches Chinese politics. ""He owns it.""","""他原来就占据支配地位，现在更加不可动摇了，""芝加哥大学研究中国政治的教授杨大力说。""统治地位归他独有。"""
"Mr. Xi has stacked the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top body, with his loyalists. He has also appointed to the broader leadership a number of domestic security officials, military commanders, ideologues, engineers and technocrats, underscoring his ambition of accelerating China's rise as a military and technological superpower while keeping it under unyielding Communist Party control.",习近平把中共最高权力机构——政治局常务委员会的成员全部换成了自己的亲信。他还任命了一些国内安全官员、军队指挥官、理论家、工程师和技术专家进入了规模更大的政治局，这凸显了他加速追求让中国作为军事和技术超级大国崛起，同时将国家牢牢置于中共控制之下的野心。
"For the world, this may portend a China newly energized to pursue Mr. Xi's agenda. Beijing is likely to remain defiant in the face of international criticism of its hard-line behavior. It is seeking greater self-sufficiency in strategic technologies. It wants to become the pre-eminent military force in the region and to strongly assert its claim over Taiwan. At the congress, Mr. Xi also said that China would promote its own initiatives to solve global development and security problems.",对世界而言，这可能预示着中国在追求习近平的议程方面再添新的力量。北京可能会在国际社会对其强硬行为的批评面前保持挑衅态度。中国正在战略技术方面寻求更大的自立。它希望成为亚太地区最卓越的军事力量，并进一步强化对台湾的主权主张。习近平在二十大上还表示，中国将在解决全球发展和安全问题上推动自己的倡议。
"To the party's supporters and many people in China, Mr. Xi's centralized control can be a strength. The party has pushed images showing how the pandemic devastated other countries. Mr. Xi has contrasted the vast mobilizing capacity of the Chinese state with what he calls the ""chaos of the West.""","对中共的支持者和许多中国人来说，习近平的集权控制可以是一种实力。中共大肆宣扬新冠病毒大流行给其他国家造成了怎样的破坏。习近平把中国政府的巨大动员能力与他所谓""西方的混乱""进行了对比。"
"""A third term for Xi Jinping very much represents continuity in all of China's current policies, unlike the United States' flip-flopping policies,"" Wang Wen, the executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies in Beijing, said in written responses to questions. ""If Xi didn't get a third term, wouldn't the world be even more worried?""","""习近平的第三个任期在很大程度上代表着中国目前所有政策的延续，不同于美国翻来覆去的政策，""人民大学重阳金融研究院执行院长王文在书面回答记者的问题时写道。 ""如果习近平没有获得第三个任期的话，世界不会更担心吗?"""
"Mr. Xi made clear that he was deeply involved in choosing the new cohort of officials. A top criterion for selection was loyalty to Mr. Xi, said an official account of the selection process that was published over the weekend. Rising officials, it said, must stay in lock step with him ""in thinking, politics and action.""","习近平明确表示，他深入参与了一批新官员的挑选工作。官媒周末发表的文章对选择过程进行了描述，首要标准是对习近平的忠诚。文章说，新上任的官员必须""在思想上、政治上、行动上""与习近平""保持高度一致""。"
But investing so much power in Mr. Xi is a profound gamble. History is replete with examples of autocrats blinded by hubris and overreach after they surrounded themselves with subordinates afraid to report bad news.,但是，把如此之多的权力集中在习近平一人身上是一场巨大的赌博。历史上充满了独裁者因傲慢和不自量力败国丧身的例子，因为他们身边都是害怕报告坏消息的下属。
"Mr. Xi's decade in power has already produced examples of overstepping or disastrous foot-dragging, notably in early 2020 when local authorities initially tried to conceal evidence that Covid, then little understood, was infectious. Some scholars argue that such risks will grow now that he has cleared the Politburo of potential mavericks.",习近平执政的头十年里已经有一些贪功致败或灾难性拖延的例子，尤其是在2020年初，地方当局最初曾试图隐瞒新冠病毒人传人的证据，人们当时对这种病毒还没有多少了解。一些学者认为，这种风险将会增加，因为习近平现已在政治局中清除了潜在的独行其事者。
"""That kind of pressure on people is really going to result in poor implementation of policy, at a minimum,"" said Susan Shirk, a former deputy assistant secretary of state during the Clinton administration and author of a new book, ""Overreach: How China Derailed Its Peaceful Rise.""","""对官员的这种压力真的至少会导致政策执行不力的问题，""曾在克林顿政府时期担任副助理国务卿的谢淑丽(Susan Shirk)说，她著有新书《贪功致败:中国如何扰乱了自己的和平崛起》(Overreach: How China Derailed Its Peaceful Rise)。"
"""People won't dare tell him the actual downsides and costs of his policies and the problems they're creating,"" she said. ""Everyone is going to be competing among themselves to show how loyal they are, and they'll end up overdoing it.""","""官员们不敢告诉习近平，他的政策实际上有不利方面，执行上有代价，并会制造新问题，""谢淑丽说。""所有的官员都将竞相展示自己的忠诚，导致他们最终会做过火。"""
"Even China's censorship apparatus seemed to betray some sensitivity about the public's response to Mr. Xi's power. State accounts on social media turned off their comment sections or showed only upbeat reactions to the news of his new term. A few dissenting views briefly evaded the censors, some using veiled language to lament Mr. Xi's omnipresence, others asking why Hu Chunhua, once seen as a potential successor to Premier Li Keqiang, had been shunted off the leadership team.",就连中国的审查机器似乎也泄露了公众对习近平权力的反应存在某种敏感性。社交媒体上的官方账号或关闭了评论区，或只显示对习近平新任期的报道表示乐观的评论。个别不同意见曾短暂地躲过了审查，有些人用含蓄的语言对习近平的权力无处不在表示失望，还有些人想知道为什么曾被视为李克强总理潜在接班人的胡春华被排除在了领导班子之外。
"""From his qualifications and performance, he should have been promoted!"" one commenter wrote. ""If ability isn't what counts, how can we revitalize?""","""以他的资历和业绩，怎么说也该进吧!""一名评论者写道。""不以能力说了算，这还怎么振兴?"""
"Having dispensed with potential counterweights in the party's top echelon, however, Mr. Xi may find that his biggest hazard becomes his own power, and the fact that responsibility for problems will rest even more clearly with him.",但是，在党内高层清除了潜在制衡后，习近平也许会发现，他最大的危险是他自己的权力，而问题的责任将更加明确地落在他身上。
"""Xi now truly owns the system, but any mistakes will also be his unmistakably,"" said Professor Yang from the University of Chicago. ""Until now, if there were some problems in the economy, he could blame it on others.""","""习近平现在是这个体制的真正主人，但任何错误也将是他的——毫无疑问，""芝加哥大学的杨大力说。""这之前，如果经济出了问题，他可以将其归咎于其他人。"""
"Mr. Xi began his march toward the party congress more than a year ago, exuding confidence that China had stifled Covid, allowing the country's economic growth to surge ahead of Western competitors'. But even as the Communist Party lauded Mr. Xi, making the case for another term in power, the economy suffered a series of setbacks that at least partly reflected his miscalculations.",一年多前，习近平就开始了在二十大上取得连任的进程，他对中国已经遏制了新冠病毒、让中国经济增长得以超过西方竞争对手充满信心。但就在中共大力颂扬习近平、为他的连任提供理由时，中国经济遭受了一系列挫折，这至少部分反映了他的误判。
A two-month Covid-19 lockdown earlier this year paralyzed businesses in Shanghai and disrupted global supply chains. Economic growth in China from April through June was actually slower than in the United States.,今年早些时候，上海进行了为期两个月的新冠封城，让企业陷入瘫痪，并扰乱了全球供应链。中国经济今年4到6月的增长率实际上低于美国。
"Mr. Xi's push for ever greater Communist Party control over life in China has played a role in the economic troubles. The housing market is in a slump after Mr. Xi sought to curb property speculation, which he has concluded is undermining long-term healthy growth, prompting dozens of real estate developers to default on their debts.",习近平推动共产党对中国的生活进行更大程度的控制，这是造成经济放缓的一部分原因。中国房地产市场陷入低迷的一个原因是习近平试图遏制房地产投机，他的结论是房地产投机正在破坏经济的长期健康增长。结果，数十家房地产开发商陷入债务违约。
His exceptionally stringent approach of imposing mass lockdowns and quarantines to eradicate Covid-19 outbreaks has throttled consumer spending on everything from cheap eateries to high-end jewelry.,习近平在消除新冠病毒上采取了异常严格的措施，包括大规模封控和集中隔离，结果是抑制了从廉价餐馆到高端珠宝等所有行业的消费者支出。
"Entrepreneurs have fled the country, fearing regulatory crackdowns and the possibility of higher taxes as part of Mr. Xi's egalitarian pledges to deliver ""common prosperity."" He has imposed extensive restrictions on the tech and online education sectors, contributing to widespread unemployment among Chinese under the age of 25.","企业家们纷纷逃离中国，因为担心监管打击，也担心习近平为实现""共同富裕""的平等主义承诺，可能会把提高税收作为措施之一。习近平还对科技和在线教育行业进行了广泛的限制，导致25岁以下的中国人失业率大增。"
"Mr. Xi's team already has a history of overreach on economic policy. In 2017, energy officials forced schools and apartment buildings in northeast China to rip out coal-fired boilers as part of a national campaign to reduce air pollution. But the natural gas heating systems that were to replace them were not yet ready, forcing children to endure classes in freezing temperatures.",习近平的领导班子在经济政策上有过贪功致败的历史。 2017年，作为全国减少空气污染运动的一部分，能源官员们曾强迫北方的学校和公寓楼拆除燃煤锅炉。但替代这些锅炉的天然气供暖系统还没有准备好，结果，一些儿童不得不忍受教室里的寒冷温度。
"Given Mr. Xi's emphasis on national security and social stability, few experts expect China to return to the freewheeling business climate that accompanied rapid economic growth before he took office. On the contrary, Mr. Xi talked far more about Marxism than markets in his opening speech at the party congress.",考虑到习近平对国家安全和社会稳定的重视，很少有专家预计中国会回到他上任前的那种放任自流的商业环境，那种环境曾给经济带来了快速增长。相反，习近平在二十大开幕式的报告中提到马克思主义的次数远多与市场的次数。
"Faced with the threat of crippling economic sanctions by the United States and its allies, Mr. Xi has carefully cultivated a new crop of technocrats scientists and engineers in fields like defense and space exploration to carry out his broader goals, such as efforts to manufacture semiconductors and commercial aircraft.",面对美国及其盟友实施严厉经济措施的威胁，习近平精心培植了一批新的技术官僚——国防和太空等领域的科学家和工程师——以实现他的更广泛目标，例如制造半导体和商用飞机。
"Top-level promotions included those of two former leaders of China's space program, an ex-executive of one of China's largest defense contractors and the former head of China's nuclear safety agency. Their rise in a time of intensified strategic competition is no accident, said Joel Andreas, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University and author of ""Rise of the Red Engineers.""",进入政治局的官员包括中国航天项目的两名前领导人、中国最大的武器制造商之一的前总经理，以及中国核安全机构的前负责人。这些人在战略竞争加剧的时期被提升绝非偶然，约翰霍普金斯大学社会学教授、《红色工程师的上升》(Rise of the Red Engineers)一书的作者乔尔·安德烈亚斯说。
"""They've got to build up their own key industries including chips and aerospace,"" he said, ""especially because they're no longer on friendly terms with the United States.""","""中国必须加强自己的关键产业，包括芯片和航空航天，""安德烈亚斯说，""尤其是因为中国与美国的关系不再友好。"""
"Among Mr. Xi's appointees is Li Qiang, the party secretary of Shanghai, who may be China's next premier. Mr. Li has also worked at the top level in two provinces that are pillars of the national economy, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. Mr. Li's image was tainted by the harsh lockdown in Shanghai earlier this year, but he has a reputation for competence, said Professor Yang from the University of Chicago.",习近平提拔的人当中包括上海市委书记李强，他可能会出任中国的下任总理。李强曾在浙江和江苏担任领导职务，这两个省都是国民经济的支柱。芝加哥大学的杨大力说，虽然李强的形象因今年早些时候上海的严格封城受到了影响，但关于他工作能力的口碑不错。
"Still, even the most qualified or confident officials may eventually quake at the idea of challenging Mr. Xi's policies. The appointment of a Standing Committee so thoroughly populated with loyalists sends a strong signal that conformity is a road to success.",尽管如此，即使是最有能力或最自信的官员，最终也可能不敢挑战习近平的政策。常委会成员全都是拥护和忠于他的嫡系，这样做发出的一个强烈信号是，遵命是通往成功之路。
"One of the new entrants into the top body was Cai Qi, a longtime associate of Mr. Xi who was the party secretary of Beijing. In the capital, Mr. Cai is known for starting a divisive drive in 2017 to demolish cheap housing on the edges of the city.",政治局新常委之一是蔡奇，他是习近平的长期助手，任北京市委书记。蔡奇曾在2017年出过名，因为他发动了一场将外来务工者驱逐出首都的有争议运动，拆除了城市边缘的廉价住房。
"The ostensible reason for doing so was that the buildings were unlicensed and unsafe, but the campaign also served Mr. Xi's demand to hold down the population of Beijing. Soon enough, the abrupt departure of tens of thousands of migrant workers created serious problems for businesses that employed them as couriers, cleaners and builders.",拆除那些房子的表面原因是没有许可证，而且不安全，但那场运动也符合习近平控制北京人口的要求。数以万计的农民工很快突然离开了北京，给一些企业带来了严重的问题，这给雇用他们做快递员、清洁工和建筑工的企业带来了严重问题。
The bulldozing epitomized the risks that have now grown for China: men who answer to the top at the expense of the citizens below. (The 24-member Politburo no longer has women either for the first time in 25 years.),这种强行做法是中国面临越来越大风险的缩影:一群男人(本届政治局的24名成员中25年来首次不再有女性)不惜以牺牲下层公民的利益为代价听命于最高领导人。
"""Xi is surrounded by yes-men,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor emeritus at Hong Kong Baptist University, ""and there are not even any yes-women.""","""习近平身边都是唯唯诺诺的男人，""香港浸信会大学政治学名誉教授高敬文(Jean-Pierre Cabestan)说。""甚至没有任何唯唯诺诺的女人。"""
"If one person was considered almost certain for promotion to the Standing Committee, it was Ding Xuexiang.",如果有一个人被认为几乎肯定会晋升为常委，那就是丁薛祥。
"On paper, Mr. Ding would seem a less likely candidate than some other contenders. He has never led a province, either as party secretary or governor. He has worked largely as a behind-the-scenes technocrat, including in his most recent post directing the office of the Communist Party Central Committee, the roughly 200-member group of the party's top officials. That role is heavily administrative. Some have compared Mr. Ding to a chief of staff for Xi Jinping, China's leader.",从履历上看，与其他一些竞争者相比，丁薛祥似乎不太可能成为候选人。他从来没有领导过一个省份，无论是作为党委书记还是省长。他在很大程度上是一个幕后的技术官僚，包括最近的中共中央委员会办公厅主任一职，该委员会由大约200名党的高级官员组成。这一职务具有浓厚的行政色彩。有人将丁薛祥比作中国领导人习近平的幕僚长。
"It is precisely that proximity to Mr. Xi that probably worked in Mr. Ding's favor. As Mr. Xi has sought to purge political rivals and surround himself with allies, loyalty has become a key criteria for advancement. And Mr. Ding, who also serves as a secretary to Mr. Xi, is perceived as one of the leader's most reliable backers.",恰恰是这种与习较近的关系成为丁薛祥的优势。随着习近平试图清除政敌，拉拢盟友，忠诚度成为晋升的关键标准。同时担任习近平秘书的丁薛祥被认为是这位领导人最可靠的支持者之一。
"When Mr. Xi traveled to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan last month, on his first trip abroad since the coronavirus pandemic began, Mr. Ding accompanied him. Mr. Ding also traveled with Mr. Xi to Washington in 2015. And he is by Mr. Xi's side when he travels domestically.",上个月出访哈萨克斯坦和乌兹别克斯坦是习近平自新冠病毒疫情以来首次出国访问，丁薛祥陪同他前往。丁还在2015年与习近平一起前往华盛顿。习近平在国内的走动，也会有他陪同。
"He is also widely believed to be the office director for China's National Security Commission, a secretive body that has grown more influential as Mr. Xi has put more emphasis on guarding against foreign and domestic threats.",丁薛祥还被普遍认为是中央国家安全委员会办公室主任，随着习近平更强调防范国内外威胁，这个秘密机构的影响力越来越大。
"Mr. Ding's history with Mr. Xi dates to 2007, when Mr. Xi was briefly party chief in Shanghai and Mr. Ding a long-serving party official there. Mr. Ding moved to Beijing in 2013 to join the Central Committee's general office and has led it since 2017. That year, he ascended to the 25-member Politburo, even though he had been only an alternate member for the much larger Central Committee five years earlier, a promotion that some took as a sign of Mr. Xi's patronage.",丁薛祥与习近平之间的渊源可以追溯到2007年，当时习近平曾短暂担任上海市委书记，丁薛祥则长期担任上海市委官员。丁薛祥于2013年前往北京，进入中共中央办公厅工作，并从2017年起成为该部门领导人。那一年，他进入了由25名成员组成的政治局，尽管五年前他只是规模大得多的中央委员会的候补委员，一些人认为这一晋升表明他受到习近平的提携。
"At 60 years old, Mr. Ding is the youngest of the Standing Committee members. But many analysts say he is unlikely to be a successor to Mr. Xi, given his lack of leadership experience at the provincial level. In that sense, he may be a best-of-both-worlds pick for Mr. Xi: loyal but not threatening.",60岁的丁薛祥是最年轻的常委会成员。但许多分析人士说，由于缺乏省级领导经验，他不太可能成为习近平的继任者。从这个意义上说，对于习近平，他可能是鱼与熊掌兼得的最佳人选:忠诚但不具威胁性。
"Wang Huning, the soft-spoken theoretician, is staying in China's top decision-making body, a sign of continuity in the Communist Party's hard-line policies and the persistent role of ideology in Xi Jinping's next five-year term.",说话轻声细语的理论家王沪宁将留任中国最高决策机构，这标志着中共强硬政策的延续，以及意识形态将在习近平的下一个五年任期发挥持久作用。
"Formerly head of China's top organizational body, Mr. Wang is poised to move up to head either China's legislature or its top political advisory body. His retention stands out amid a high-turnover transition that saw Xi loyalists replace four senior officials. It points to the vital role Mr. Wang has played, and will continue to play, in legitimizing Mr. Xi's growing power, with the leader staying on for a precedent-breaking third term and possibly longer.",王沪宁曾担任中国最高组织机构负责人，现在他有望升任中国立法机关或最高政治协商机构的负责人。在习派人马取代了四名高级官员的大规模换届中，他的留任显得尤为突出。这表明，在使习近平不断增长的权力合法化的问题上，王沪宁已经并将继续发挥至关重要的作用。习近平将开始打破先例的第三个任期，甚至可能掌权更久。
"Handpicked by former President Jiang Zemin from a Shanghai university in the 1990s, Mr. Wang has had a long political career, serving as an ideological adviser to Mr. Jiang as well as his two successors. In 2017, during Mr. Xi's second term, Mr. Wang was elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest rung of Chinese politics.",上世纪90年代，王沪宁由前国家主席江泽民从上海一所大学亲手提拔，他的政治生涯漫长，先后担任江泽民及其两位继任者的意识形态顾问。2017年，在习近平第二个任期内，王沪宁升至政治局常委，这是中国政治级别最高的机构。
"Unlike many of his peers, Mr. Wang gained little to no governing experience as he ascended the party ranks. A scholar by training, he made a name for himself as a propagandist, blending the ideas of Marx, Confucius and top party leaders into digestible Chinese slogans. He has helped to write numerous high-profile documents and speeches.",与许多同僚不同，王沪宁在党内升迁之路上基本没有累积多少治理经验。他是科班出身的学者，以理论家的身份声名鹊起，将马克思、孔子和党的最高领导人的思想融为易于理解的中文口号。他帮助撰写了许多备受瞩目的文件和讲话稿。
"He has left his imprint on all three of the last Chinese leaders' defining mottos, most recently, the ""China Dream"": the idea that China, under Mr. Xi's wise and steady hand, will reach a new era of global ascendancy.","他在中国最近三位领导人的标志性口号中都留下了自己的印记，最近一次是""中国梦"":即中国将在习近平英明、坚定的领导下，进入一个主导全球的新时代。"
"During Mr. Xi's rule, Mr. Wang has had a central role in policymaking. He has held leadership posts on committees controlling vast sectors of society including propaganda, education, cybersecurity and legal reform.",在习近平执政期间，王沪宁在政策制定方面扮演了核心角色。他曾在控制广大社会部门的委员会中担任领导职务，包括宣传、教育、网络安全和法律改革。
"""He's no longer just an ideologue,"" said Matt Johnson, a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution. ""Wang has been at the center of everything.""","""他不再只是个理论家，""胡佛研究所的客座研究员马特·约翰逊说。""王沪宁一直都是一切的中心。"""
"Though Mr. Wang hails from a different faction than Mr. Xi, their thinking now appears to be in lock step: the academic's rise has been synchronous with Mr. Xi's expanding hard-line agenda: a growing suspicion of Western ideas and influence, constriction of internet freedoms, and a revival of traditional Chinese values as they are interpreted by the party.",尽管王沪宁与习近平来自不同政治派别，但现在他们的想法似乎是一致的:这位学者的崛起与习近平不断扩大的强硬议程同步，那就是对西方思想和影响力的日益怀疑，对互联网自由的限制，以及党所诠释的中国传统价值观的复兴。
"In the 1980s, Mr. Wang helped popularize a theory known as ""neo-authoritarianism,"" the idea that a country as poor and big as China needed strongman rule to maintain order while pushing through market reforms. The idea would later form the basis of the ""China model,"" the state-controlled capitalist system Mr. Xi now touts as one of China's signature achievements.","在上世纪80年代，王沪宁帮助推行一种被称为""新威权主义""的理论，即像中国这样的贫穷大国在推动市场改革的同时，需要强人统治来维持秩序。这一思想后来成为""中国模式""的基础，习近平如今将这种国家控制的资本主义制度极力吹捧为中国的标志性成就之一。"
"More recently, Mr. Wang has helped meld the language of the party around the idea of Mr. Xi as a man of destiny.",而在最近，王沪宁围绕习近平乃天命所系的理念帮助塑造党的措辞。
"These formulations ""aided and abetted Xi Jinping into thinking he was justified to stay in power,"" said Geremie R. Barme, a Sinologist in New Zealand. ""He's facilitated Xi Jinping's domination of the party for the next 20 or 30 years.""","这些构想""帮助并怂恿习近平认为，他有理由继续掌权""，新西兰汉学家白杰明(Geremie R. Barmé)说。""他促成了习近平在未来二三十年对党的统治。"""
"Mr. Wang's promotion on Sunday, which extends his political longevity, suggests that his thought work has been tremendously successful and remains unfinished.",王沪宁在周日的升迁延长了他的政治寿命，表明他的思想工作取得了巨大的成功——而且仍未完工。
"HONG KONG Thousands of posters condemning China's top leader have appeared on college campuses in New York, Barcelona, Stockholm, Tokyo and elsewhere over the past few days as Chinese students and dissidents spread the message of a lone protester in China.",香港——过去几天，数千张谴责中国最高领导人的海报出现在纽约、巴塞罗那、斯德哥尔摩、东京等地的大学校园里，中国留学生和持不同政见者在传播国内一个独自抗议者的信息。
"The posters paper pasted onto just about everything have one common theme: Oust the ""despotic traitor,"" Xi Jinping.","这些四处张贴的海报有一个共同的主题:罢免""独裁国贼""习近平。"
"Those words first appeared in Beijing on Oct. 13. As Mr. Xi, China's top leader, was expected to coast to a third term during the Communist Party congress, someone whose identity has not been confirmed, managed to hang a banner on a busy bridge calling for Mr. Xi's dismissal. On Sunday, that third term was confirmed.",这些话最早于10月13日出现在北京。就在中国最高领导人习近平被认为将在二十大上轻松获得第三个任期之际，一个身份尚未得到证实的抗议者设法在一座交通繁忙的立交桥上悬挂横幅，要求习近平下台。周日，习近平的第三个任期得到了确认。
"The protest slogans on the banner also included ""Elections, Not Dictatorship"" and ""Citizens, Not Flunkies.""","横幅上的抗议口号还包括""不要领袖要选票""和""不做奴才做公民""。"
"The appearance of such strong dissent before an important Communist Party meeting, in a heavily policed city, astonished the whole country. The protester was taken away by police, and online discussions were quickly censored.",在一座戒备森严的城市，在召开重要的共产党会议之前出现如此强烈的异议，震惊了全国。这名抗议者被警方带走，网上的讨论很快遭到删除。
"Dissidents, however, then found ways to amplify the message overseas. The protest slogans on the Beijing bridge have popped up on bulletin boards, poles and bus stations at more than 200 colleges across at least 20 countries, as many international Chinese students said they were saluting the protester and fighting Mr. Xi's autocracy.",然而，持不同政见者随后找到了将这一信息传播到海外的方法。北京立交桥上的抗议口号出现在了至少20个国家的200多所大学的公告栏、电线杆和公交车站上，许多中国留学生说，他们致敬抗议者，反对习近平的独裁统治。
"""I used to be surrounded by a deep powerlessness over political resistance, but the Beijing protester inspired me, showing there are ways to fight,"" said Xintong Zhang, 24, a Chinese student at the University of Toronto, who sobbed when seeing the protester's banner on social media. She later put up dozens of ""Dictator Out"" posters around campus at dawn.","""以前，我对政治抵抗有着深深的无力感，但北京的抗议者激励了我，让我看到了抗争的方法，""多伦多大学24岁的中国学生章辛童(音)说。在社交媒体上看到抗议者的横幅时，她哽咽了。后来，在黎明时分，她在校园里张贴了几十张""独裁者下台""的海报。"
"Compared with other autocracies such as Russia, Iran and Myanmar, China is regarded by many human rights organizations as even less hospitable to free speech and government protest. Under Mr. Xi, opposition and criticism is heavily suppressed with a mix of state security, online censorship and the threat of severe punishment. No independent media and civil society organizations remain 10 years into his rule. Freedom House, a U.S. pro-democracy group, has ranked China last in internet freedom for eight consecutive years.","与俄罗斯、伊朗和缅甸等其他独裁国家相比，许多人权组织认为，中国对言论自由和反对政府抗议活动的态度更不友好。在习近平上台后，反对和批评受到了国家安全、网络审查和严厉惩罚威胁的压制。在他执政10年后，中国已经没有任何独立的媒体和民间社会组织继续存在。美国民主组织""自由之家""连续八年将中国的互联网自由度排在最后。"
"Ms. Zhang said many Chinese especially her peers, who started high school after Mr. Xi came to power did not know how to fight authoritarianism whether at home or abroad.",章辛童说，许多中国人，尤其是她的同辈，都是在习近平上台后开始上高中的，他们不知道如何在国内和国外反对威权主义。
"""Now we have the Beijing protester, and I can look up to him,"" she said. ""I know I should speak out and how to do it.""","""现在我们有了北京的抗议者，我可以他为楷模，""她说。""我知道我应该直言不讳，知道该怎么做了。"""
"Some of the new activists are concerned that even outside China, there are risks that come with opposing the Chinese government.",一些新的活动人士担心，即使在中国境外，反对中国政府也存在风险。
"A student at the University of Texas at Austin who posted anti-Xi posters on campus said that he was worried about being targeted and harassed by nationalist Chinese students. The student, who is surnamed Zhou, declined to be identified by his full name, citing the same reason.",得克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校的一名在校园里张贴反习海报的学生表示，他担心自己会被民族主义的中国学生盯上，受到他们的骚扰。正因为这个原因，这位姓周(音)的学生拒绝透露自己的全名。
"Ms. Zhang said she worried about being harassed by other Chinese students, assuming the majority were nationalists. As a result, she wore a mask when putting up posters to avoid being identified.",章辛童说，她也担心会受到其他中国学生的骚扰，她认为其中大多数是民族主义者。因此，她在张贴海报时戴上了口罩，以免被人认出。
"She found most of her posters had been torn down and some had been left half hanging from bulletin boards. ""I felt heartbroken but then relieved,"" she said. ""It's okay if they tore down my posters as long as I keep posting until the party congress finishes.""","她发现她张贴的大部分海报已经被撕掉了，有的还剩下一半挂在布告栏上。""我感到很难过，但随后又坦然了，""她说。""只要我一直贴到二十大结束，就算他们把我的海报撕了也没关系。"""
"The overseas anti-Xi slogans gained traction after they were collected and shared by pro-democracy Instagram accounts run by anonymous volunteers, mostly Chinese citizens living abroad.",海外反习标语在被亲民主Instagram帐户收集和分享后获得了关注，这些帐户由匿名志愿者运营，他们主要是居住在海外的中国公民。
"""A brave man should have an echo,"" one of the groups, Citizens Daily CN, posted on Instagram.","""一个人的勇敢不应该没有回声，""其中一个名为Citizens Daily CN的组织在Instagram上写道。"
"A two-month lockdown in Shanghai earlier this year looked at the time as though it might doom the political career of the city's Communist Party leader, Li Qiang. Confined in their homes or in shoddy quarantine facilities, residents struggled to obtain food and fought with police officers clad in white hazmat suits.",今年早些时候，上海封城两个月，在当时看来，这可能会毁掉中共在上海的领导人李强的政治生涯。居民被关在家中或条件恶劣的隔离中心里，难以获取食品，和穿着白色防护服的警察对抗。
"Despite the lockdown, Mr. Li, 63, retained the support throughout of the one man who really counts: Xi Jinping, China's top leader. And on Sunday, Mr. Li emerged on the stage at the Great Hall of the People as China's second-highest official after Mr. Xi himself.",尽管如此，现年63岁的李强自始至终得到了那位说话真正算数的人的支持:中国最高领导人习近平。周日，李强以中国第二高官的位置出现在人民大会堂，地位仅次于习近平。
"Mr. Li's ranking puts him in line to become China's new premier next March, a post that will give him broad authority over the vast bureaucracy of the Chinese government.",李强的排名将使他有可能在明年3月成为中国的新总理，这一职位将赋予他统领中国政府庞大官僚机构的广泛权力。
"""The connection with Xi Jinping is crucial there is no lack of competent administrators in the Communist Party, so the patron-client system of promotion remains important,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor emeritus of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University.","""与习近平的联系至关重要——共产党中不缺乏有能力的管理者，因此恩庇侍从的晋升体系仍然重要，""香港浸信会大学政治学名誉教授高敬文(Jean-Pierre Cabestan)说。"
"The promotion of Mr. Li contrasts with Mr. Xi's removal of both top officials in Hubei Province in early 2020 after the new coronavirus first emerged in the provincial capital, Wuhan, and prompted a lockdown of nearly 11 weeks.",与李强的晋升形成鲜明对比的是，习近平于2020年初将湖北省两名高官撤职。此前新冠病毒在湖北省会武汉首次出现，导致该市封城长达11周时间。
"Mr. Li was born and grew up in prosperous Zhejiang Province, just south of Shanghai, and worked his way up the provincial bureaucracy. His career took off after he served as essentially the chief of staff for Mr. Xi, who was the province's Communist Party secretary from 2002 to 2007.",李强在上海以南的富裕省份浙江出生长大，并一步步进入省级官僚机构工作。习近平从2002年至2007年担任浙江省委书记，身为省委秘书长的李强事业开始腾飞。
"Two months after Mr. Xi became China's top leader in 2012, he named Mr. Li the governor of Zhejiang Province. Three years later, he promoted Mr. Li, appointing him the Communist Party secretary of Jiangsu Province, an affluent hub of industrial activity. And in 2017, he named Mr. Li as Communist Party secretary of Shanghai traditionally a steppingstone to the Standing Committee of the Politburo, including for Mr. Xi himself.",习近平在2012年成为中国最高领导人两个月后，任命李强为浙江省省长。三年后，他提拔李强，将其任命为江苏省委书记，那里是富裕的工业中心。2017年，他又任命李强为上海市委书记，传统上，这个职位是进入政治局常务委员会的跳板，包括习近平本人也是如此。
"Mr. Li worked closely with multinational executives and Chinese business leaders alike in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai. But he has not worked in Beijing and has no experience in overseeing the State Council, China's cabinet or the dozens of ministries under the State Council.",李强与浙江、江苏和上海的跨国公司高管和中国商业领袖紧密合作。但是他没有在北京工作过，没有在国务院或国务院下设的数十个政府部门担任领导工作的经验。
"That lack of Beijing experience means that Mr. Li will be heavily dependent on Mr. Xi's continued support, said Yang Zhang, a professor at American University's School of International Service. ""He will have to rely upon Xi's authority and other aides most of whom will be Xi's associates from other sources to make the State Council function,"" he said.","美利坚大学国际服务学院教授张杨说，缺乏北京经验意味着李强将非常依赖习近平的继续支持。他说:""他将不得不依靠习近平的权威和其他亲信——大多数将是习近平来自其他渠道的人马——来使国务院运转。"""
"China's leader, Xi Jinping, unveiled the country's new leadership lineup on Sunday all officials with close ties to him. A meeting of Communist Party decision makers confirmed that Mr. Xi will stay as party general secretary for another five years a foregone conclusion and anointed six other members of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest tier of power.",周日，中国领导人习近平揭开了该国新一届领导班子的面纱——所有官员都与他关系紧密。共产党决策层的会议确认，习近平将继续担任中共总书记五年——一个已知的定论，会议还任命了政治局常委的其他六名成员，政治局常委是中国的最高权力机构。
The members are:,常委们分别是:
"Mr. Xi: As well as party leader, he retains his title as head of the military, and is likely to remain state president.",习近平:除了党的领导人之外，他很可能保留另外两个主要头衔:国家主席和军委主席。
"Li Qiang: A new member. As party chief of Shanghai, he oversaw a contentious Covid lockdown. But his longstanding ties to Mr. Xi appeared to help him through.",李强:新成员。在担任上海市党委书记期间，他领导了饱受争议的新冠封城。但他与习近平的长期关系似乎帮助他度过了难关。
Zhao Leji: The low-key head of the party's agency for investigating corruption and disloyalty.,赵乐际:党内调查腐败和不忠行为机构的低调负责人。
"Wang Huning: The party's veteran ideological seer, who has shaped Mr. Xi's nationalist ideas. He may get a new role.",王沪宁:中共的资深意识形态军师，他塑造了习近平的民族主义理念。他可能获得一个新职位。
"Cai Qi: A new member. His ties to Mr. Xi go back over two decades to Fujian Province. Mr. Xi showed his trust by appointing him party chief of Beijing, the all-important capital.",蔡奇:新成员。他与习近平的关系可追溯回20年前的福建省。习近平任命他为至关重要的首都北京的市委书记，显示出对他的信任。
"Ding Xuexiang: A new member. A close aide to Mr. Xi, he almost always travels with the top leader, and helps him manage party matters.",丁薛祥:新成员。他是习近平的亲密助手，几乎总是与这位最高领导人一道出行，并且协助他管理党内事务。
"Li Xi: A new member. He is the party secretary of Guangdong Province, where he tightened top-down control. He is set to lead the party's agency for investigating corrupt or disloyal officials.",李希:新成员。广东省委书记，在那里他加强了自上而下的控制。他将领导中共调查腐败和不忠行为的机构。
"A decade ago, China looked as though it had reached a milestone: Its politics, which earlier had been dominated by mercurial strongmen, seemed to have solidly crossed over to stable, predictable governance.",十年前，中国看起来已经进入一个新阶段:此前反复无常的强人主导的政治似乎已经稳健过渡到了稳定、可预测的治理模式。
"Xi Jinping's elevation to the helm of the Communist Party, in 2012, followed another peaceful transfer of power between two leaders in 2002. Term limits, along with new norms that eschewed unilateral decision-making and the formation of personality cults, all seemed proof that China's authoritarian system could adapt and rein in its own excesses.",继2002年换届后，习近平在2012年被提拔为中共掌舵人，也遵循了领导人和平权力交接的前例。任期限制，再加上避免单方面决策和个人崇拜形成的新规范，似乎都证明了中国的威权体制可以做到适应和克制。
"That all changed under Mr. Xi, who now bestrides China like an all-powerful patriarch. Shortly after assuming the highest political position of General Secretary, he launched a withering campaign against corruption, rooting out factional rivals along with deserved culprits. Among the targets was Zhou Yongkang, China's fearsome security czar. Since 2013, most members of Mr. Zhou's faction alongside over a million lower-ranking officials have been punished or stripped of power.","在习近平治下，这一切都已经变了。他如今就像一位无上的族长一样驾临中国。在担任总书记这一最高政治职务后不久，他发起了一场严酷的反腐败运动，除了的确罪有应得的人，那些敌对派系人物也连带被一网打尽。威名在外的""政法沙皇""周永康就是他的目标之一。自2013年以来，周永康派系的大多数成员——以及上百万级别更低的官员——都受到了惩罚或被剥夺了权力。"
"Mr. Xi's crusade against graft has been a pillar of his power-consolidating efforts, said Ian Johnson, a senior fellow for Chinese studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Most campaigns last for a couple years and they fade away,"" he said. ""But this one is their version of the forever war it's ongoing.""","外交关系委员会的中国问题高级研究员张彦(Ian Johnson)表示，习近平的反腐运动一直都是他巩固权力的核心手段。""大多数运动几年后就逐渐平息了，""他说。""但这一次是属于他们的永恒战争——至今仍在进行中。"""
"During his first term, Mr. Xi bestowed new titles on himself. Unsatisfied with the standard portfolio of president, head of the party and head of the military, he now sits atop committees that govern, among other things, the economy, internet security and relations with Taiwan. As unilateral power replaced collective decision-making, Mr. Xi became known as the ""chairman of everything.""","在首个任期内，习近平给自己安上了各种新头衔。国家主席、总书记和军委主席的标准职务组合仍不能令他满意，他如今还是管理经济、互联网安全与对台关系等事务的众多委员会的最高指挥。习近平有了""万能主席""的称号。"
"""He's become the sole decider on a large number of policy issues,"" said Victor Shih, a professor of Chinese politics at U.C. San Diego and the author of ""Coalitions of the Weak.""","""他已成为许多政策问题的唯一决策者，""加州大学圣迭戈分校的中国政治专家、《弱者联盟》(Coalitions of the Weak)一书的作者史宗瀚(Victor Shih)表示。"
"The norms and processes observed by his two past predecessors are now largely gone. In their stead, Mr. Xi has created a party apparatus that hails, and encircles, him as ""the core."" He has minted his own creed and has revived in a manner redolent of an older generation of Communist heroes such as Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong a culture of worship. Mr. Xi has downplayed the historical achievements of top leaders, and promoted his own in an effort to match his status to that of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In 2018, in a stunning reversal of precedent, Mr. Xi lifted the term limits on the presidency, paving the way for a lifetime in power.","他的两位前任所遵循的规范和程序如今已基本不复存在。取而代之的是，习近平打造了一个拥护他为""核心""的政党架构。他创立了自己的指导思想，并以一种与斯大林和毛泽东这些老一辈共产主义领袖相似的方式，复兴了个人崇拜的文化。习近平淡化了其他最高领导人的历史功绩，并推崇自身成就，试图让自己的地位与毛泽东和邓小平相提并论。2018年，习近平惊人地打破了先例，取消了主席任期限制，为终身掌权铺平了道路。"
It was a moment packed with symbolism.,这是一个充满象征意义的时刻。
"China's frail former leader, Hu Jintao, who presided over one of China's more open and prosperous periods, was shepherded out of the closing session of an important political meeting on Saturday, a rare disruption in a highly choreographed proceeding.",周六，中国虚弱的前领导人胡锦涛被带离一个重要的政治会议的闭幕式，罕见扰乱了一个被高度排演的流程。胡锦涛曾领导了中国一个更加开放和繁荣的时期。
"Mr. Hu, 79, was sitting in the front row next to his successor, Xi Jinping, when two attendants approached his table. One tried to lift him out of his chair, an effort Mr. Hu resisted. But then he stood up by himself, as the attendants continued standing behind him, while some of the senior officials nearby looked on in apparent concern.",79岁的胡锦涛坐在第一排，紧挨着他的继任者习近平。两名现场人员走到他的桌前，其中一人试图把他从椅子上拉起来。胡锦涛表现得很抗拒，但随后自己站了起来。两人继续站在他身后，附近的一些高级官员对事态发展表现出明显关切。
"After a brief exchange with the attendants, Mr. Hu, who appeared hesitant and possibly confused, said a few words to Mr. Xi, who gave the elder leader an expressionless nod, and Li Keqiang, who as China's premier is the nation's second-ranking official. Then Mr. Hu was led out of the hall.",在与现场人员进行了简短的交流之后，胡锦涛显得有些犹豫，看上去也可能有些困惑，他对习近平和李克强说了几句话，习近平向这位年长的领导人面无表情地点了点头，李克强是中国现任总理、该国排名第二的官员。然后，胡锦涛被带出了大厅。
Observers cycled through possible explanations: A positive Covid-19 test? Something else health-related? Or a scripted political gesture for international cameras to capture and frame?,观察者们不停讨论着可能的解释:新冠检测呈阳性?其他与健康有关的情况?又或者这是一个为了让国际媒体捕捉和定格而设计的政治姿态?
"The truth, like much else with Chinese politics, will probably never be revealed. But the episodes's timing, moments after reporters were allowed to enter the hall, was at least suggestive.",就像中国政治中的许多其他事情一样，真相可能永远不会被揭露。但是，这段插曲在记者被允许进入大厅后不久发生，其时间至少是有暗示性的。
"""Given how carefully these meetings are rehearsed and arranged, the fact that they let this happen in front of everyone, in front of the media, is the most important thing,"" said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University.","""考虑到这些会议是如何精心演练和安排的，他们让这种情况在所有人面前、在媒体面前发生，是最重要的。""新加坡管理大学的法律教授高树超(Henry Gao)说。"
"Last Sunday, in his keynote speech at the opening of the Party Congress, Mr. Xi went down a list of dissatisfactions, those accumulated during the decade before his rule. They included weakness in the Party, in the economy, and in national security, as well as the Party's posture toward Hong Kong and Taiwan.",上周日，在二十大开幕式的主题讲话中，习近平列出了一份在他执政之前的十年中所积累的不满清单，包括在党内、经济和国家安全方面的弱点，以及中共对香港和台湾的姿态。
"""With Xi, he doesn't do these things for nothing,"" Mr. Gao said. ""Hu was the one in power 10 years ago.""","""对习近平来说，他不会毫无缘由地做这些事情，""高树超说。""胡锦涛是十年前的当权者。"""
"Mr. Hu, who led China from 2003 to 2013, represented a different, more open era. His leadership style was more consultative the result of a balance of party factions in the top leadership. He also oversaw the Beijing Olympics and a decade of double-digit economic growth. China's global reputation had improved, and the discussions on the internet were relatively free.",在2003年至2013年间领导中国的胡锦涛代表了一个不同的、更加开放的时代。他的领导风格更具磋商性——这是高层领导中党内各派别平衡的结果。在他治下，北京举办了奥运会，并实现了十年两位数的经济增长。中国的全球声誉一度得到改善，互联网上的讨论也相对自由。
"That has all changed under Mr. Xi. On Saturday, Mr. Xi hurried into retirement several senior figures of a more moderate political stripe, many of them former associates of Mr. Hu. They were replaced by Xi loyalists.",在习近平的领导下，这一切都发生了变化。周六，习近平让几位政治立场较为温和的高级人物匆忙退休，其中许多人是胡锦涛的前副手。他们被习近平的忠实拥护者取代。
"""It's All the King's Men now,"" said Kaiser Kuo, a host of Sinica, a podcast on Chinese current affairs.","""现在都是国王的人了，""讨论中国时事的播客Sinica的主播郭怡广说。"
"Poised to take a groundbreaking third term in power, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has advanced a contingent of Communist Party loyalists ready to defend him, expand state influence over the economy and bolster national security.",中国领导人习近平即将迎来前所未有的第三任期，他已提拔了一群随时准备为他而战的效忠派共产党人，扩大了政府对经济的影响，加强了国家安全。
Mr. Xi opened the new phase of his authoritarian rule with a clutch of victories at the end of a party congress on Saturday. He hurried into retirement two top officials from a more moderate political mold. He positioned allies to dominate the new leadership. He kept officials who have promoted his muscular approach in diplomacy and the military. And Mr. Xi gave no hint of preparing for eventual retirement by anointing a likely successor.,在周六的党代会闭幕之际，习近平以一系列胜利成果开启了他威权统治的新阶段。他让两名政治理念较温和的最高层官员匆忙退休。他留下了那些在外交和军事上宣扬他强硬政策的官员。而且，习近平没有指定潜在的继任者，完全没有要为最终退休做准备的意思。
"""China has entered a new era of maximum Xi,"" saidNeil Thomas, an analyst of Chinese politics for the Eurasia Group. The outcome, Mr. Thomas added, ""means more support for Xi's policies, which means a stronger focus on political control, economic statism, and assertive diplomacy.""","""中国已经进入了一个习近平最大化的新时代，""欧亚集团的中国政治分析员尼尔·托马斯说。托马斯还表示，这样的结果""表明对习近平政策的更多支持，这意味着更加注重政治控制、经济国家主义和强硬的外交""。"
"Since taking over as party leader in late 2012, Mr. Xi has transformed China, purging potential rivals, crushing dissent and reasserting the central role of the Communist Party in Chinese society. Mr. Xi's progress toward his new term has been hampered this year by China's painful economic slowdown, spreading public frustration over the country's strict Covid rules, and rumors of internal opposition.",自2012年底接任中共领导人以来，习近平改变了中国，清洗了潜在的竞争对手，粉碎了异议，并重申了共产党在中国社会中的核心作用。今年，由于中国经济不景气、公众对新冠防疫政策不满情绪的蔓延、以及党内反对的传言，习近平迈向新任期的进展曾受到阻碍。
"The congress, however, seemed to brush all that aside with regimented acclaim for Mr. Xi, urging the party's members to stay in lock step with him ""in thought, politics and action.""","然而，党代会似乎将这一切抛在一边，对习近平大唱赞歌，敦促党员""在思想上、政治上、行动上""与他保持一致。"
"Mr. Xi's keynotespeechat the opening of the congress last Sunday signaled that he would press on with fortifying China against a plethora of perceived dangers. That includes stepping up efforts to turn China into a leading technology power, reducing reliance on Western know-how. He also said that China would continue upgrading its already formidable national security apparatus.",上周日，习近平在二十大开幕式上的主题报告表明他将继续加强中国的力量，以应对众多已察觉到的危险。这包括加大努力将中国打造成一个先进技术大国，减少对西方技术的依赖。他还表示，中国将继续升级其本已强大的国家安全机构。
"Mr. Xi also bolstered his status when the congress approved amendments to the party charter its foundational rules to elevate his authority. A statement from the meeting said that Mr. Xi's leadership was essential to ""eradicating grave hazards were present inside the party, state and military,"" apparently referring to corruption and disloyalty.","习近平也巩固了自己的地位，因为二十大通过了党章修正案以提升他的权威。大会的一份报告表示，习近平的领导对于""消除党、国家、军队内部存在的严重隐患""至关重要，这些隐患显然指的是腐败和不忠。"
"He is likely to face even less potential pushback to his policies after the congress approved the new membership list for the Central Committee, the elite body from which China's top leaders are drawn.",在二十大批准了新一届中央委员会成员名单后，习近平施政所面临的阻力可能会进一步减少，该委员会是选举中国最高领导人的最高权力机关。
"Several senior figures stepped down, all but ensuring that more of Mr. Xi's favored officials will rise into the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's highest decision-making body. Mr. Xi's enhanced control suggests China will maintain its tough stance toward Washington, and expand the party's intervention in the economy, technology and the internet.",多位高级官员卸任，这几乎确保了更多习近平青睐的官员将升至政治局常务委员会，这是党的最高决策机构。习近平加强控制意味着中国将保持对美国强硬的立场，并扩大党对经济、技术和互联网的干预。
"""There's not a single sign of any fundamental revisions of policy,"" saidRichard McGregor, an expert on Chinese politics at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. ""It's all shoulders to the wheel.""","""没有任何根本性政策调整的迹象，""悉尼洛伊研究所的中国政治专家马利德说。""都是一条路走到底的调子。"""
"Mr. Xi's new term and his leadership team will not be officially confirmed until Sunday, when the new Central Committee meets and holds a carefully controlled vote. But the scale of Mr. Xi's victory was already clear from the Central Committee makeup, experts said.",习近平的新任期和他的领导团队要到周日才能正式确认，届时，新一届中央委员会将召开会议，并举行一次受到严格控制的投票。但专家表示，从中央委员会的构成来看，习近平的胜利已经很明确了。
"The party congress is usually a choreographed affair, but the unexpected departure of the former leader, Hu Jintao, caused a brief stir. Mr. Hu, 79, had been seated next to Mr. Xi in the front row on the stage when, possibly unwell, he was helped to his feet by an aide and escorted out of the cavernous hall, without explanation. As he was led off the stage, Mr. Hu appeared to speak to Mr. Xi and to pat Li Keqiang, the premier, on his shoulder.",党代会通常会按部就班进行，但前国家领导人胡锦涛的意外离场引发了一阵轰动。79岁的胡锦涛坐在台上第一排习近平的身旁，也许身体不适，他被一名助手扶起并护送出了宏大的会场，没有给出任何解释。被带下台时，胡锦涛似乎在对习近平说话，还拍了拍总理李克强的肩膀。
"Mr. Li and two other top officials who had risen under Mr. Hu Wang Yang and Han Zheng stepped down from the Central Committee, indicating that all three are set to retire. Mr. Li has served for the past decade as China's premier, the second most powerful post in China, but Mr. Xi has overshadowed Mr. Li for years.",李克强及汪洋和韩正这两位在胡锦涛任内崛起的高级官员退出了中央委员会，这表明此三人都将退休。在过去十年间，李克强一直担任中国总理，这是中国排在第二位的要职，但多年来，习近平的风头都盖过了李克强。
"""There's been a lot about the premier-as-savior talk that these officials could stay around and push back against Xi, but obviously that's not going to happen,"" saidChristopher K. Johnson, the president of the China Strategies Group and a former C.I.A. analyst of Chinese politics. ""Proximity to Xi is all that really matters now.""","""有很多关于总理力挽狂澜的说法——这些官员留下来可以与习近平对抗，但这显然不会发生，""中国战略集团总裁、前中情局中国政治分析师克里斯托弗·K·约翰逊说。""与习近平关系密切才是现在真正管用的。"""
"Hu Chunhua, currently a vice premier, still has a chance of entering the new Politburo Standing Committee, despite his lack of robust ties to Mr. Xi.",现任副总理胡春华仍有机会进入新一届政治局常委会，尽管他与习近平的关系并不紧密。
"""If Hu Chunhua is promoted, he will be expected to be a loyal Xi acolyte like everybody else,"" Mr. McGregor said. ""There are no alternative centers of power centers left in the Standing Committee, if there ever were, even symbolically.""","""如果胡春华被提拔，那他也会像其他人一样成为习近平的忠实追随者，""马利德说。""常委会就算曾经有过其他权力中心，现在也没有了，连象征性的都没了。"""
"Aside from Mr. Li, several others set to retire were senior leaders with a record of favoring market-oriented policies and a somewhat less confrontational stance toward the West. They included Wang Yang, a current Politburo Standing Committee member, as well as three top officials in finance: Liu He, Guo Shuqing and Yi Gang.",除李克强之外，其他几位即将退休的高层领导都曾支持市场导向的政策，对西方的立场也没有那么强的对抗性。这些人包括现任政治局常委汪洋，以及三名高级金融官员:刘鹤、郭树清和易纲。
"""The generation of financial technocrats with both professional training and deep connections with the global financial community is passing from the scene,"" said Victor Shih, a specialist in China's politics and finance at the University of California in San Diego. He said they were being ""replaced by career provincial bankers who have a track record of executing the party's policies.""","""受过专业培训、在全球金融界人脉深厚的一代金融技术官僚正在淡出，""加利福尼亚大学圣迭戈分校的中国政治和金融问题专家史宗瀚(Victor Shih)表示。他说，取代他们的是一些""在地方银行工作、向来坚持执行党的政策的职业官员""。"
"Cheng Li, a specialist in Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, had a similar take. ""Xi Jinping has further consolidated near-absolute power by promoting his proteges to the top leadership,"" he said.","布鲁金斯学会的中国政治专家李成也有类似看法。""通过将他的人提拔进入最高领导层，习近平进一步巩固了近乎绝对的权力，""他说。"
"The shake-up of China's leadership reflected a partial break with an informal rule of the past two decades: that senior officials 68 and older retired at party congresses, while those 67 or younger stayed on. Mr. Li, 67, and Mr. Wang, the same age, were both out. But Wang Huning, who recently turned 67, stayed on the Central Committee and is likely to remain a key political lieutenant to Mr. Xi, who is 69.",中国领导层的变动反映了过去二十年的不成文规则已经遭到一定破坏:即68岁及以上的高级官员应在党代会上退休，而67岁及以下的会留任。67岁的李克强和汪洋都退了。但最近刚满67岁的王沪宁留在了中央委员会，很可能仍会是69岁的习近平的重要政治副手。
"Officials seen as possible additions to the next Politburo Standing Committee include Li Qiang, the party chief of Shanghai, who oversaw its bruising Covid lockdown earlier this year. He was essentially Mr. Xi's chief of staff when both worked in Zhejiang Province 15 years ago. Ding Xuexiang, currently a senior aide to Mr. Xi, is also a strong contender for elevation into the next top lineup.",被认为可能增补进下届政治局常委名单的官员包括上海市委书记、在今年早些时候负责实施了严酷的新冠封锁的李强。15年前，他与习近平都在浙江任职，是习近平实质上的幕僚长。现为习近平的高级助手的丁薛祥也是进入下届领导集团的有力竞争者。
"The makeup of the new Central Committee suggested that Mr. Xi was generally happy with the handling of China's diplomacy, military affairs and domestic security, several analysts said.",多位分析人士表示，新一届中央委员会的构成表明，习近平对中国外交、军事和国内安全事务的处理总体上是满意的。
"China's ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, was promoted to full membership in the Central Committee. He had worked closely with Mr. Xi as the foreign ministry's head of protocol soon after Mr. Xi became China's top leader, and now has a rank in the party that leaves him well positioned to play an even larger role in China's foreign policy.",中国驻美大使秦刚晋升为中央委员。在习近平成为中国最高领导人后不久，秦刚曾作为外交部礼宾司司长密切配合习近平的工作，如今他在党内的地位使他能够在中国外交政策上发挥更大的作用。
"Mr. Xi kept on board Zhang Youxia, a military commander who, at age 72, had been widely expected to retire. General Zhang has been at the forefront of modernizing the People's Liberation Army, and has combat experience in China's border conflict with Vietnam from 1979.",习近平还留下了72岁的军方领导人张又侠，外界普遍预计他将退休。主导了解放军现代化的张又侠上将在1979年开始的中越边境冲突中获得了实战经验。
"""By pushing moderates and potential rivals out of the leadership, Xi conveys his overall priorities for sociopolitical stability, national security and policy continuity now and in the years to come,"" said Mr. Li, the Brookings expert.","""通过将温和派和潜在竞争对手赶出领导层，习近平传达出的是，他现在和未来几年的总体优先事项是社会政治稳定、国家安全和政策连续性，""布鲁金斯学会专家李成表示。"
"HONG KONG As anger simmered in Wuhan over the mishandling of the first coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, the Communist Party sent top officials to deal with the growing political crisis. One of them, Sun Chunlan, stayed for three months, rallying local cadres and sourcing protective gear for health workers and hospital beds for patients.",香港——2020年初，由于对首次暴发的新冠病毒处理不当，武汉的愤怒情绪升温，共产党派出高级官员处理日益严重的政治危机。其中一位名叫孙春兰的官员在那里待了三个月，召集当地干部，为医护人员采购防护装备，为病人提供医院床位。
"Calling for absolute loyalty in a war against the virus, Ms. Sun warned that any deserters would be ""nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever.""","孙春兰呼吁在抗击病毒的战争中保持绝对忠诚，她警告，任何逃兵都将被""永远钉在历史的耻辱柱上""。"
"Now known as China's ""zero-Covid"" czar, Ms. Sun has become the enforcer of the country's strict pandemic restrictions. When she arrives in a city in the midst of an outbreak, she is often the online target of derision and frustration, cast as a doomsayer that a lockdown is coming.","孙春兰现在被视为中国的""清零""沙皇，成了中国严格疫情限制措施的执行者。每当她到达一个疫情暴发的城市，她经常成为网民嘲笑和发泄不满的对象，被塑造成宣告封城即将到来的末日预言者。"
"As the rare woman in the upper echelons of Chinese politics, it is a role to which she has become accustom, driving the Communist Party's will and bearing the country's criticism. ""Women most of the time get pushed to the frontline when male politicians don't want to deal with a crisis,"" said Hanzhang Liu, assistant professor of politics at Pitzer College.","作为中国政治高层中少有的女性，她已经习惯了这个角色，推动共产党的意志，承受国家的批评。""大多数时候，当男性政治人士不想处理危机时，女性就会被推到前线，""皮策学院政治学助理教授刘含章(音)说。"
"Mao Zedong famously waved the banner of gender equality as a core principle of China's Communist Party. But seven decades on, the party has failed to promote women to positions of political power.",毛泽东曾经高举性别平等的旗帜，将其作为中国共产党的核心原则。但70年过去了，中共未能提拔女性担任掌握政治权力的职位。
"Since 1949, just eight women have risen to the powerful 25-member Politburo, including Ms. Sun, who at 72 is expected to step down from the body this week. Three of the women were married to the Communist Party's revolutionary founders. No woman has ever been let in to the Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest governing body.",自1949年以来，只有八名女性进入了由25名成员组成、权力巨大的中央政治局，其中包括现年72岁的孙春兰，她预计将于本周从该机构卸任。这八名女性中的三名是共产党革命奠基者的妻子。从未有女性被允许进入中国最高管理机构政治局常务委员会。
"The Communist Party congress this week, when China's top leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to secure a groundbreaking third term, is once again a typical scene of suits and ties less than a third of the delegates are women.",本周，中国最高领导人习近平有望获得前所未有的第三个任期，共产党代表大会依然是典型的西装领带场景——其中只有不到三分之一的代表是女性。
"The gender imbalance is reinforced at the highest levels by a political agenda that has increasingly promoted conservative ideas about family structures and the role of women in society. Like many women with ambitions for public office, Ms. Sun was at times pushed into positions considered politically unimportant. But as she rose, she built her own network of supporters, including former President Hu Jintao, allowing her to create the kind of resume and patronage needed to make it to the top.",由于政治议程日益推崇有关家庭结构和女性在社会中作用的保守观念，性别失衡在最高层得到了强化。和许多有志担任公职的女性一样，孙春兰有时会被推到政治上不重要的职位。但随着不断晋升，她建立了自己的支持者网络，包括前国家主席胡锦涛，使她能够创造出提拔到高层所需的履历——以及靠山。
"""Sun Chunlan is an incredible politician in any context,"" said Victor Shih, an expert in Chinese politics at the University of California at San Diego. ""In a democratic system, a politician with these qualities likely would have been elected as the national leader.""","""在任何情况下，孙春兰都是一位不可思议的政治家，""加州大学圣地亚哥分校中国政治专家史宗瀚说。""在民主制度下，具有这些品质的政治家很可能会当选为国家领导人。"""
The opportunities for women in politics are so limited that there are only a handful of women who have risen high enough to likely be considered for the next Politburo.,在中国，女性从政的机会非常有限，只有少数女性能够晋升到足够高的职位，有成为下一届政治局人选的可能性。
"Officials typically climb Communist Party ranks by showing that they can bolster the economy in the cities and provinces they oversee. But women are rarely given those jobs, said Minglu Chen, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney who studies gender and politics in China.",官员们往往通过展示自己能够推动所管理城市和省份的经济发展来提升党内地位。但悉尼大学研究中国性别与政治的高级讲师陈明璐(音)说，女性很少得到这些工作。
"Instead women in the party are often placed in roles overseeing what are considered softer areas like health care, education and culture. ""That also limits their possibilities to be promoted,"" Ms. Chen said.","相反，党内的女性往往被安排负责一些被视为没有那么重要的领域，如医疗、教育和文化。""这也限制了她们升职的可能性，""陈明璐说。"
"Frustrated by the lack of opportunities for women, Chen Muhua, the chair of the All-China Women's Federation and the second woman to become deputy prime minister, pushed for a quota system in the 1990s, said Xinhui Jiang, an assistant professor at Nanjing University. When she thought the first version didn't go far enough, she wrote to Hu Jintao, who would later go on to be the president of China, pointing out the deficiencies.",南京大学助理教授蒋心慧说，由于女性获得的机会太少，全国妇联前任主席、第二位女性副总理陈慕华在上世纪90年代推动了一项配额制度，当她认为第一版做得还不够时，她写信给后来成为中国国家主席的胡锦涛，指出了其中的不足之处。
Out of her efforts was born a party mandate that there be at least one female leader in every layer of government up to the provincial level. The requirement stops before the Politburo.,在她的努力下，诞生了一项党规:在省级至省级以下的各级政府中至少要有一名女性领导人。这个要求止步于政治局。
"Ms. Sun, who has no family ties to the party's revolutionary founders, started as a worker at a factory that made watches in the northeastern city of Anshan. She climbed up the ranks, working various party manager positions at two factories and later serving as the director of the municipal women's federation.",孙春兰与中国共产党的创始人没有姻亲关系，她最初在东北城市鞍山的一家手表厂当工人。她不断得到提拔，在两家工厂担任过各种党政职务，后来担任市妇联主任。
"A former colleague who lived in the same building as Ms. Sun recalled how she would knock on the door each day to offer a ride to work in her car. ""What impressed me most about her was that she was easygoing and didn't put on bureaucratic airs,"" the colleague told state media in 2009.","一位曾和孙春兰住在同一栋楼的前同事回忆，后者每天下楼时都会来敲门，用配的车顺路捎这位同事上班。""她给我最大的印象是随和，没有官架子，""这位同事2009年对官方媒体说。"
"In a rare interview, Ms. Sun spoke with pride about her blue collar past. ""I come from a worker's background, and I have a very deep and special feeling for organized labor,"" she told the Dalian Daily.","在一次罕见的采访中，孙春兰自豪地谈起了自己的工人生活。她在接受《大连日报》采访时表示:""我是工人出身，我对工会组织有着非常深刻和特殊的感情。"""
"As party secretary of Dalian, a city in northeastern China, Ms. Sun honed her political acumen. She clashed with her predecessor, Bo Xilai, a brash politician from a prominent family who whose meteoric rise would come to a crashing end in 2012 and pave the way for Mr. Xi to take power. She blocked Mr. Bo's appointees and built up her own political base in the city, said Cheng Li, a scholar at the Brookings Institution.",在担任东北城市大连的市委书记期间，孙春兰锻炼出了政治头脑。她与她的前任薄熙来发生了冲突，后者是一位自以为是、来自显赫家族的政治人士，他昙花一现的崛起在2012年戛然而止，为习近平掌权铺平了道路。布鲁金斯学会的学者李成说，她阻止了薄熙来任命的官员，并在该市建立了自己的政治基础。
"""Bo came from a princeling family, he never hid that he was born red and entitled to many things. Sun came from a very humble background and so from day one, both people could not get along well,"" said Mr. Li.","""薄熙来是太子党出身，他从不隐瞒自己出身高贵，有权得到很多东西。孙春兰出身贫寒，所以从第一天开始，两人就相处不好，""李成说。"
"In 2009, Ms. Sun was named party secretary in the southern province of Fujian where Mr. Xi had served as governor a decade earlier. When Mr. Xi was elevated to party leader in 2012, she was named to the Politburo, eventually overseeing health, education, sports and culture.",2009年，孙春兰被任命为南部省份福建的党委书记，十年前，习近平曾在该省担任省长。当习近平在2012年被提升为党的领导人时，她被任命为政治局委员，最终负责文教体卫。
"During the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, Ms. Sun led a group of experts to Wuhan on Jan. 27, four days after officials sealed the city off. The mayor of Wuhan had just offered to step down for moving too slowly.",在2020年新冠病毒暴发的早期，孙春兰于1月27日带领一个专家小组来到武汉，四天前，官员们封锁了这座城市。武汉市长刚刚因行动太慢提出辞职。
"As the death rate shot past 4.1 percent, Ms. Sun invoked wartime measures. The sick were rounded up and transported to makeshift quarantine camps. Officials wielding temperature guns went house-to-house hunting for the virus.",随着死亡率突破4.1%，孙春兰引入了战时措施。病人被集中起来，送往临时隔离设施。官员们拿着测温枪挨家挨户搜寻病毒。
"Under the guidance of Ms. Sun, the authorities refined measures that would become an integral part of China's ""zero-Covid"" policy and the idea that ordinary people would have to sacrifice for the greater good of the country.","在孙春兰的指挥下，当局完善了一些举措，这些措施成为了中国""清零""政策以及普通民众必须为国家的更大利益做出牺牲理念的组成部分。"
"A month and a half later Mr. Xi traveled to Wuhan to declare that the efforts had ""turned the tide.""","一个半月后，习近平前往武汉，宣布这些努力""扭转了局面""。"
"That early wartime mentality has remained even as the threat of the virus has changed. The authorities still closely track the virus and use punishing lockdowns, but public support is waning.",即使病毒的威胁发生了变化，这种早期的战时心态仍然存在。当局仍在密切追踪病毒并采取惩罚性封锁措施，但公众的支持正在减弱。
"Ms. Sun has become the target of growing anger, much of it expressed online and quickly taken down by censors. These days, her arrival in a city has come to be seen as a bad omen.",孙春兰已成为越来越多愤怒的目标，其中大部分是在网上表达的，并很快被审查人员删除。如今，她对一个城市的到访已被视为不祥之兆。
"On the internet, she has been derided as the ""Lockdown Aunty"" and the ""Witch Sun.""","在网上，她被嘲笑为""封城大妈""和""孙巫婆""。"
"Nearly two decades earlier in 2003, one of Ms. Sun's female predecessors on the Politburo, Wu Yi, also inherited a crisis after the health minister at the time resigned amid accusations of covering up the scale of a SARS outbreak.",近二十年前的2003年，孙春兰在政治局的一位女性前任吴仪也接手了一场危机，当时的卫生部长因被指控掩盖SARS疫情的规模而辞职。
"State media played up Ms. Wu's reputation as an ""Iron Lady,"" for being a tough negotiator during trade discussions with the United States throughout the 1990s and the 2000s on intellectual property rights and China's acceptance into the World Trade Organization. Reporters described her as a ""tomboy,"" noting her short hair and what they saw as an assertive nature.","官方媒体大肆宣扬吴仪的""铁娘子""名声，因为她在1990年代和2000年代与美国就知识产权和中国加入世界贸易组织的贸易谈判中是个强硬的谈判代表。记者注意到她的短发，看到她的自信本性，称她为""假小子""。"
"""When you look at how the general public view female leaders, there is a gendered lens that casts a negative view,"" said Fubing Su, a professor of politics at Vassar College.","瓦萨学院政治学教授苏福兵说:""当你观察公众对女性领导人的看法时，会有一个带来负面看法的性别滤镜。"""
"As the party now readies itself for a new group of leaders, there are three women all in their 60s seen by Chinese experts as having the potential to join the Politburo. Shen Yiqin is the party secretary of Guizhou Province in China's southwest and the only woman at the highest provincial level. Yu Hongqiu is the only woman among eight deputies at the Communist Party's anti-corruption body. Shen Yueyue is the president of the All-China Women's Federation.",随着中共准备好迎来新的领导班子，中国专家认为有三名女性(均为60多岁)具有加入政治局的潜力。谌贻琴是中国西南地区贵州省委书记，也是唯一一位担任省级最高级别职位的女性。喻红秋是中共反腐机构八名代表中唯一的女性。沈跃跃是全国妇联主席。
"""For young Chinese women who would like to pursue a career in politics, they just don't have a lot of examples to follow,"" said Ms. Chen of the University of Sydney. ""They don't have all these figures to look up to and to be their inspiration.""","""对于想从政的年轻中国女性来说，她们没有太多的榜样可以效仿，""悉尼大学的陈明璐说。""她们没有多少人物可以崇拜并带来启发。"""
The world's most important non-change in leadership is happening right now in China.,世界上最重要的领导层不变正在中国发生。
"At a Communist Party congress this week, Xi Jinping, the country's top leader for the last 10 years, is all but certain to secure another five years in the job. Xi's recent predecessors each left office after about a decade to protect China from abuses of power like those during the chaotic Mao era. Xi is expected to cast this precedent aside, taking the country down a more authoritarian path as economic growth teeters and tensions flare with the West.",在本周的共产党代表大会上，过去10年担任该国最高领导人的习近平几乎肯定会在这个位置上再待五年。习近平最近的几位前任都在大约十年后卸任，以保护中国免受混乱的毛泽东时代那样的权力滥用。随着经济增长步履蹒跚，与西方的紧张局势加剧，预计习近平将抛开惯例，让中国走上一条更加专制的道路。
My colleagues in and around China are covering this pivotal moment. I'm going to focus on what it might mean for the climate.,身在中国和周边地区的同事们正在报道这一关键时刻。我将重点关注它对气候变化的意义。
"Xi has ramped up China's ambitions for reducing carbon emissions and slowing global warming. He reiterated those goals in typically grandiose language this week. (""We must uphold and act on the principle that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets."") But he has also allied himself with a leader whose actions are threatening to throw the global climate fight in reverse: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.","习近平提高了中国减少碳排放和减缓全球变暖的目标。本周，他以典型的宏大语言重申了这些目标。(""必须牢固树立和践行绿水青山就是金山银山的理念。"")但他还和一位领导人结盟，该领导人的行动有可能逆转对全球气候变化的斗争:俄罗斯总统普京。"
"Climate change will continue to test China, and Xi",气候变化将继续考验中国和习近平
"This summer, China sweltered through more than two months of record-high temperatures, the country's most prolonged heat wave since modern records began in 1961. The Yangtze River dried to a trickle. Factories halted production to reduce the burden on power grids. The government's chief forecaster, Chen Lijuan, told a Communist Party news outlet that the extreme highs could become a ""new normal.""","今年夏天，中国经历了两个多月的创纪录高温，这是该国自1961年有现代记录以来持续时间最长的热浪。长江干涸，水位急剧下降。工厂停产以减轻电网负担。政府的首席气象预报员陈丽娟对一家党媒表示，极端高温可能成为""新常态""。"
"Last year, the catastrophe was the opposite: People drowned in subway cars as torrential summer rain flooded tunnels in the inland metropolis of Zhengzhou.",去年的灾难恰恰相反:内陆大都市郑州的夏季暴雨淹没了隧道，有人淹死在地铁车厢里。
"Scientists warn that global warming is widening the swings between wet and dry extremes in many regions, including China. Xi is no doubt keenly aware that political power in China has for centuries been closely linked with leaders' ability to manage floods, droughts and crop failures.",科学家警告说，全球变暖正在扩大包括中国在内的许多地区极端干湿气候之间的波动。习近平无疑很清楚，几个世纪以来，中国的政治权力一直与领导人管理洪水、干旱和作物歉收的能力密切相关。
Xi has big plans for cutting emissions,对于减排，习近平有宏伟的计划……
"With all its steel and cement plants, coal-fired power stations and power-guzzling factories, China is by far the biggest emitter of planet-warming gases today.",由于众多的钢铁和水泥厂、燃煤发电站和耗电量巨大的工厂，中国是全球最大排放国，温室气体排放量远超其它国家。
"Xi wants China's industrial economy to keep growing. But he's also vowing to make it greener. He has taken some steps to deliver, and more will be needed in his next term if he intends to see his pledges through.",习近平希望中国的工业经济保持增长。但他也发誓要让它更环保。他已经采取了一些措施落实，如果他打算兑现他的承诺，在他的下一个任期内还需要履行更多。
"In 2020, Xi promised China's emissions would peak within a decade. Since then, Chinese officials have confirmed the timelines for reductions in specific industrial sectors and have set targets for wind and solar capacity that are even more ambitious than Xi's 2020 goals would have required.",2020年，习近平承诺中国的排放量将在十年内达到峰值。从那时起，中国官员已经确认了特定工业部门减排的时间表，并设定了比习近平的2020年目标更高的风能和太阳能装机容量目标。
"Last year, Xi said China would stop building coal-burning power plants overseas. As of August, 26 out of 104 such projects had been shelved, preventing 85 million tons of carbon dioxide from being added each year into the atmosphere, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",去年，习近平表示，中国将停止在海外建设燃煤电厂。根据能源与清洁空气研究中心的数据，截至8月，104个此类项目中有26个已被搁置，每年可避免8500万吨二氧化碳进入大气。
but tensions with the West are complicating things,……但与西方的紧张关系使事情变得复杂
"It was only last year that China and the Biden administration surprised climate negotiators in Scotland by announcing a joint effort to curb fossil-fuel emissions. Since then, though, the two powers have continued to clash over trade, technology, human rights and more the ""stormy seas"" for China that Xi warned about at this week's party congress. That could make it harder for the two countries to collaborate more on climate.","中国和拜登政府去年才宣布共同努力遏制化石燃料排放，这一宣布让苏格兰的气候谈判代表感到惊讶。不过，从那以后，这两个大国继续在贸易、技术、人权等问题上发生冲突——习近平在本周的党代会上警告称，这对中国来说是""惊涛骇浪""。这可能会使两国更难就气候问题进行更多合作。"
"Officially, China suspended climate talks with the United States as retaliation for Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August. (The Communist Party considers Taiwan its territory and has not ruled out annexing the self-governing, democratic island by force.)",中国正式暂停与美国的气候谈判，以报复议长南希·佩洛西8月访问台湾。(共产党将台湾视为其领土，不排除以武力夺取这个自治民主岛屿。)
"But even if the world's two biggest emitters start talking again, one of the United States' newest and most ambitious climate efforts could exacerbate trade tensions. The Inflation Reduction Act includes incentives for domestic production of clean energy hardware including batteries and wind turbines. Chinese companies dominate these industries a source of frustration for American politicians who say that efforts to fight global warming are helping businesses in China and enabling coercive labor practices there.",但即使世界上最大的两个排放国再次开始对话，美国最新、目标最宏大的气候努力之一也可能加剧贸易紧张局势。《降低通货膨胀法》提供了国内清洁能源设备生产的激励政策，包括电池和风力涡轮机。中国公司主导着这些行业——这让美国政界人士感到沮丧，他们说对抗全球变暖的努力正在帮助中国的企业，并纵容了那里的强迫劳动行为。
"And then, there's Russia. Xi has emerged in recent years as President Putin's most powerful enabler. China's purchases of Russian oil and gas have frustrated American and European efforts to isolate the Kremlin for its war in Ukraine.",然后还有俄罗斯的问题。近年来，习近平已成为普京总统最强大的支持者。美国和欧洲因乌克兰战争而孤立克里姆林宫，但中国购买俄罗斯石油和天然气的行为对这些努力构成了阻碍。
"In 2014, Xi and Putin met in Shanghai to sign a huge gas deal. Five years later, they celebrated Xi's 66th birthday together in Tajikistan; Putin offered Russian ice cream as a present, according to China's official news agency. The two men met again at this year's Winter Olympics in Beijing. A joint statement afterward said their nations' friendship had ""no limits.""","2014年，习近平和普京在上海会面，达成了一项巨额天然气交易。五年后在塔吉克斯坦，普京向习近平祝贺他的66岁生日;据中国官方通讯社报道，普京赠送俄罗斯冰淇淋作为礼物。两人在今年的北京冬奥会上再次会面。随后发表的一份联合声明称，两国的友谊""没有止境""。"
"A few weeks later, Russian forces attacked Ukraine.",几周后，俄罗斯军队对乌克兰发动攻击。
"As Xi Jinping was preparing to take the helm of the Chinese Communist Party a decade ago, a great number of China's political, business and intellectual elites were hopeful that he would make their country more open, just and prosperous.",十年前，当习近平准备执掌中国共产党时，大量中国政治、商业和知识精英都希望他能使他们的国家更加开放、公正和繁荣。
"They included a professor at the party's top academy who helped train thousands of high-ranking cadres. An economist who would win China's top economics prize for 2012. A young historian planning to teach a class about contemporary Chinese history, including sensitive periods like the Cultural Revolution.",这其中包括一名中共最高学府的教授，曾参与培训数以千计的高级干部;一位后来获得2012年中国最高经济学奖的经济学家;还有一位年轻的历史学家，她本计划在课堂上讲授中国当代史，包括文化大革命等敏感时期。
"Mr. Xi's speech at the opening of the 20th party congress on Sunday made it clearer than ever that China is moving in the opposite direction from liberalization. Obsessed with national security, he is more focused on quashing all ideological and geopolitical challenges than on reform and opening up, the policies that brought China out of poverty.",习近平上周日在党的二十大开幕式上的讲话比以往任何时候都更清楚地表明，中国正朝着与自由化相反的方向发展。他对国家安全非常执着，更专注于平息所有意识形态和地缘政治挑战，而不是曾令中国摆脱贫困的改革和开放政策。
"He used the term ""new era"" 39 times in his speech, boasting of the party's achievements under his leadership. But for some Chinese, it has been a dark era a shift away from a system that, while authoritarian, tolerated private enterprise and some diversity in public opinion, to one that now espouses a single ideology and a single leader.","他在演讲中39次使用""新时代""一词，夸耀党在他领导下取得的成就。但对一些中国人来说，这是一个黑暗的时代——从一个虽然威权主义，但同时也容忍私营企业和公共舆论中一些多样性的系统，转变为如今这个支持单一意识形态和单一领导人的系统。"
"The former professor at the Central Party School, Cai Xia, urged the United States and the world to see China as she sees it: as a totalitarian state that rules with ""terror and ideology,"" referring to a well-known political theory.","前中央党校教授蔡霞敦促美国和世界像她那样看待中国:一个以""恐怖和意识形态""进行统治的极权主义国家，这里她提到的是一个著名的政治理论。"
"""It's been an era of moving backward,"" she said after watching Mr. Xi's speech. ""It was a decade that was marked by economic retrogression and ideological struggles.""","""这是一个完全倒退的时代，""观看了习近平的演讲后她说。""是从经济上的倒退到意识形态以斗争为主旋律的十年。"""
"Ms. Cai has been expelled from the party for such criticism. The historian, Sun Peidong, can no longer teach or publish freely. Xu Chenggang, the economist, is disappointed that the party once again controls everything, including the private sector.",蔡霞因为这类批评而被开除出党。历史学家孙沛东不能再自由教学或出版作品。经济学家许成钢对党再次控制包括私人部门在内的一切感到失望。
All three are living in the United States.,三人目前都住在美国。
"They all believe that China, with its vast surveillance systems and punitive social control, now resembles Stalin's Soviet Union and Mao Zedong's China. In their view, even Russia and Iran have more space for dissent.",他们都认为，中国拥有庞大的监控系统和惩罚性的社会控制，如今已类似于斯大林的苏联和毛泽东的中国。在他们看来，甚至俄罗斯和伊朗都有更多的异议空间。
"It's a view whispered at dinner tables and in chat groups. One online nickname refers to China as the ""North Korea to the west.""","这是饭桌上和聊天群里悄悄议论的观点。网上有人戏称中国为""西朝鲜""。"
"Many Chinese people were surprised to learn that before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russians could access Twitter and Facebook, and that there were several independent Russian media outlets. Beijing has nearly absolute control over what information Chinese people can access and what they can say online.",许多中国人惊讶地发现，在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前，俄罗斯人可以访问Twitter和Facebook，而且有几个独立的俄罗斯媒体机构。北京几乎绝对控制着中国人在网上可以获得的信息和所发表的言论。
"Last month, Chinese internet users were astonished as protesters in Iran chanted ""death to the dictator"" in antigovernment demonstrations, spurred by the death of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, in police custody for allegedly breaking the country's strict rules on how women can dress. They found it remarkable that the Iranian president had called the victim's father to offer condolences.","上个月，伊朗的抗议者在反政府示威中高呼""独裁者去死""，这令中国的互联网用户非常惊讶，抗议的导火索是年轻女性玛莎·阿米尼因涉嫌违反该国对女性着装的严格规定而被警方拘留，并在拘留期间死亡。他们发现伊朗总统致电受害者的父亲表示哀悼，大为讶异。"
"Some people contrasted that with China's handling of a bus accident, a few days before Ms. Amini's death, that killed at least 27 passengers who were being transferred to a Covid quarantine facility. The crash led to widespread online protests against China's harsh pandemic policy. But they didn't make much of a difference: Only a vice mayor apologized.",一些人将此事与中国对一起大巴事故的处理方式进行对比，该事故生在阿米尼去世的几天前，导致至少27名正被转移到新冠隔离设施的乘客死亡。这起事故导致人们在网上广泛抗议中国严厉的防疫政策。但是抗议并没有起到多大作用。只有一位副市长道了歉。
The government never released the victims' names. The episode ended like many other tragedies in China these days: with truth hidden and forgotten.,政府从未公布受害者的姓名。该事件的结局就像这些天来中国的其他许多悲剧一样:真相被隐藏和遗忘。
"""Totalitarianism is a virus of humanity. It's a cancer,"" said Ms. Sun, the historian.","""极权是人类社会的一种病毒，是一种毒瘤，""历史学家孙沛东说。"
A party insider,党内人士
"Ms. Cai was born in 1952 to a revolutionary military family, a so-called ""red offspring."" For years, she counseled China's top leadership on how to make the party system stronger.","蔡霞于1952年出生在一个革命军人家庭，是所谓的""红二代""。多年来，她一直为中国最高领导层提供有关加强党建的建议。"
"When Mr. Xi came to power in 2012, Ms. Cai believed that the party would embark on a path of reform. But Mr. Xi soon began going after journalists, lawyers, entrepreneurs and nongovernmental organizations.",当习近平在2012年上台时，蔡霞认为共产党将走上改革之路。但是，习近平很快就开始对记者、律师、企业家和非政府组织下手。
"Four years later, she had her first major break with the party. She was incensed that the propaganda apparatus had launched a ferocious campaign against Ren Zhiqiang, a retired real estate tycoon and a party member, who derided Mr. Xi's demand for absolute loyalty from the Chinese news media.",四年后，她第一次与党组织发生了重大分歧。任志强是一名退休的房地产大亨，也是一名党员，他嘲笑习近平要求中国新闻媒体保持绝对忠诚，宣传机构对其发起一场残酷的运动，她对此感到非常愤怒。
"""Cracking down on different opinions will bring severe dangers to the party,"" she wrote in an essay widely quoted in news reports. She was summoned in for talks and was asked to write letters confessing her mistakes.","她在一篇被新闻报道广泛引用的文章中写道:""打压不同意见，将会给党带来严重的危害。""她被组织约谈，并被要求写信承认自己的错误。"
"When Mr. Xi changed China's Constitution in 2018 so he could serve more than two terms as president, Ms. Cai lost hope. ""I realized that the party wasn't able to change,"" she said. ""If the party couldn't change, the country wouldn't be able to change.""","当习近平在2018年修改中国宪法使他可以连任国家主席超过两届时，蔡霞丧失了希望。""我意识到，这个党无法改变，""她说。""如果中国共产党自己不改革，中国的改革是不可能完成的。"""
"She was visiting the United States in 2020 when the pandemic hit. Like many Chinese people, she was dismayed that the party had tried to hide the first coronavirus outbreak, in the city of Wuhan.",2020年疫情暴发时，她正在美国。像许多中国人一样，党试图隐瞒武汉市爆发的第一波新冠疫情，令她感到沮丧。
"In an online hangout with friends back in China, she criticized the party as a ""political zombie"" and Mr. Xi as a ""mafia ringleader.""","在与回到中国的朋友在线交流时，她批评共产党是""政治僵尸""，习近平是""黑帮老大""。"
"""It would end very badly when this country was led by a person like him,"" she recalled of her thinking at the time, referring to Mr. Xi. ""I felt that we couldn't let this go on. We must consider replacing him with someone else.""","""这个国家被这样的一个人在领导，它会出大问题，""她在提到习近平时回忆了自己当时的想法。""所以我就觉得不能再这样下去了，必须要考虑要换人。"""
"A recording of her talk was leaked and went viral. Shortly afterward, she was expelled from the party and stripped of her retirement benefits.",她的谈话录音被泄露，并在网上流传。此后不久，她被开除党籍，并被剥夺了退休福利。
"Now, in exile in the United States, she is one of Mr. Xi's sharpest critics. Last month, she published a long essay in Foreign Affairs magazine entitled ""The Weakness of Xi Jinping: How Hubris and Paranoia Threaten China's Future.""",现在，流亡美国的她是习近平最尖锐的批评者之一。上个月，她在《外交事务》杂志上发表长文《习近平的弱点——狂妄与偏执如何威胁中国的未来》。
A market advocate,市场的倡导者
"In 2012, Mr. Xu, the economist, published a paper called ""The Fundamental Institutions of China's Reforms and Development,"" which would win the top Chinese economics prize. Lou Jiwei, Mr. Xi's first finance minister, was also a winner that year, for a paper on expanding economic reform.",2012年，经济学家许成钢发表了一篇名为《中国改革和发展的基础性制度》的论文，后来获得中国最高经济学奖。习近平的第一任财政部长楼继伟也是这一年的获奖者，他的论文内容是扩大经济改革。
"For decades, Mr. Xu, a Harvard-trained economist, had been deeply involved in debates about how to reform China economically and politically so the system could provide better protections for property and individual rights.",几十年来，作为哈佛大学的经济学家，许成钢一直深入参与如何对中国进行经济和政治改革的辩论，以期让中国的体制能为财产和个人权利提供更好的保护。
"He knew from an early age the importance of such rights. His father, a prominent physicist and a philosopher, was purged in 1958, when Mr. Xu was 7 years old. He remembers being hungry after that, and his mother crying all day long.",他从小就知道这些权利的重要性。他的父亲是一位著名的物理学家和哲学家，在1958年遭到清洗，当时许成钢七岁。他记得在那之后的忍饥挨饿，母亲整日哭泣。
"At 17, he moved to a farm near the Russian border, where he spent nearly a decade. For six of those years, he was persecuted as a counterrevolutionary.",17岁时，他搬到中俄边境附近的一个农场，在那里度过了将近10年。其中六年作为反革命分子受到迫害。
"After the death of Mao, China's totalitarian system loosened up, allowing in some private enterprise and nongovernmental organizations. That's gone now, Mr. Xu said, and the party is in charge of everything. Businesses have been under attack and entrepreneurs are no longer sure if they really control their companies.",毛泽东去世后，中国的极权体制放松了，允许一些私营企业和非政府组织进入。许成钢说，现在已经不再如此，党在掌管着一切。企业一直受到攻击，企业家们不再确信他们对公司有真实的控制。
"""A totalitarian state doesn't need to take away ownership,"" he said. ""It only needs to force you to do what it wants you to do.""","""极权不需要拿走产权，""他说。""它可以强迫你做它想做的事情。"""
"Although the majority of Mr. Xu's work dealt with mainland China, he was based in Hong Kong. After that city's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 2019, Mr. Xu moved to London, believing that China would no longer allow the freedom of speech in Hong Kong that he needed to do his work.",尽管许成钢的大部分工作都与中国内地有关，但他的工作地点在香港。2019年香港镇压民主抗议者后，许成钢移居伦敦，他认为中国不会再允许香港的言论自由，而他开展工作需要这种自由。
"Last month, he joined Stanford University as a researcher. He's writing a book on totalitarianism.",上个月，他入职斯坦福大学，成为一名研究员。他正在写一本关于极权主义的书。
A historian who wants history remembered,一位希望历史被铭记的历史学家
"Ms. Sun, 46, belongs to the generation that benefited most from China's opening up. She came of age when the country's economy was taking off and international exchanges were encouraged. After getting her Ph.D. in sociology from Sciences Po Paris in 2007, she was eager to go back to China, which she considered a land of hope and opportunity.",46岁的孙沛东属于从中国开放中受益最多的一代。她成年时正值该国经济起飞并鼓励国际交流。2007年在巴黎政治学院获得社会学专业博士学位后，她渴望回到中国，她认为中国是一片充满希望和机遇的土地。
"She started teaching contemporary Chinese history at Fudan University in Shanghai in 2013. For two years, she had no problems from the authorities, even though she taught one of few classes in China about the Cultural Revolution. She wanted the Chinese people to remember that tumultuous period.",她2013年开始在上海复旦大学教授中国当代历史。那之后的两年里，尽管她教的是中国为数不多的关于文革的课程之一，但她没有受到当局的任何质疑。她希望中国人民记住那个动荡的时期。
"Things started to change in 2015. Several of her articles about the era were rejected by Chinese academic journals. In 2018, after spending two years in the United States, she went back to Fudan, to a changed country and a changed classroom.",情况在2015年开始发生变化。她的几篇关于那个时代的文章被中国学术期刊拒绝了。2018年，在美国待了两年后，她回到复旦，回到了一个不一样的国家，一个不一样的教室。
"She found that class discussions had become less candid, and she said so on the social media platform Weibo. One morning, she found her office door plastered with printouts of her social media posts, along with threats to post them in other places on campus.",她发现课堂讨论变得不那么坦诚了，她在社交媒体平台微博上也表达了这样的观点。一天早上，她发现她的办公室门上贴满了印有她社交媒体帖子的纸条，并被威胁要在校园的其他地方张贴它们。
"Some of her students reported her to the university authorities. They attacked her on social media. Nationalistic bloggers flocked to the comment sections of her Weibo account, cursing her.",她的一些学生向校方举报了她。他们在社交媒体上攻击她。民族主义博主涌向她微博的评论区，咒骂她。
"In 2019, when some Fudan students protested the university's decision to rewrite its charter to emphasize party loyalty over values like independence and academic freedom, Ms. Sun spoke up. She criticized the university's decision in interviews with foreign media, including The New York Times.",2019年，当一些复旦学生抗议校方改写校规以强调对党的忠诚，而不是独立和学术自由等价值观的决定时，孙沛东发声了。她接受了包括《纽约时报》在内的外国媒体采访，批评了学校的决定。
The party secretary of her department repeatedly asked her to write self-criticism letters. She declined.,她所在部门的党委书记多次要求她写检讨书。她拒绝了。
"Ms. Sun, now an associate professor of history at Cornell University, says she still has nightmares about her experience. ""The teeth of totalitarianism were inching toward me,"" she said in an interview. ""If I still wanted to do the kind of research I liked, I would have to leave China.""","孙沛东现在是康奈尔大学历史系的副教授，她说她的经历仍然像噩梦一般。""极权的利齿离我越来越近，""她在接受采访时说。""如果我还想继续做我想做的研究，就只能离开中国。"""
"BEIJING China, the world's second-largest economy, announced without explanation on Monday that it was delaying indefinitely the release of economic data that had been scheduled for Tuesday morning, including closely watched numbers for economic growth from July through September, which had been expected to show continued lackluster performance.",北京——周一，作为世界第二大经济体的中国在没有给出任何解释的情况下宣布将无限期推迟原定于周二上午发布的经济数据，其中包括备受关注的7月至9月经济运行情况，人们此前预计，这些数据将显示经济的持续低迷。
"The delay by China's National Bureau of Statistics comes as the country's ruling elite has gathered in Beijing for a weeklong, twice-a-decade national congress of the Communist Party. The authorities have taken elaborate measures to prevent any disruptions during the gathering, from halting almost all travel into Beijing to requiring frequent Covid-19 tests across practically the entire country.",国家统计局宣布推迟发布数据之际，中国的统治精英们正齐聚北京，参加为期一周、每五年一次的中国共产党全国代表大会。为防止会议期间出现任何干扰，当局采取了严密措施，停止了几乎所有进北京的旅行，并要求全国几乎有所地方进行频繁的新冠病毒检测。
"Large countries seldom postpone the release of even a single economic statistic for fear of hurting financial confidence, much less the broad array of market-moving data that China's National Bureau of Statistics has now delayed. In addition to deferring the release of gross domestic product data for the third quarter, the government agency also postponed the release of September data for retail sales, industrial production, fixed asset investment and other categories.",由于担心损害金融信心，大国很少推迟发布哪怕只是一项经济统计数据，更不用说是中国国家统计局现在推迟发布的一系列影响市场动向的广泛数据了。除了推迟发布三季度国内生产总值数据外，国家统计局还推迟了9月份其他数据的发布，包括零售额、工业产出和固定资产投资等。
"""I've not come across before a situation where a whole raft of statistical reporting has just been postponed, in nearly half a century of monitoring data releases not even in times of pestilence and conflict,"" said George Magnus, a former chief economist of UBS who is now an associate at the China Center at Oxford University.","""在跟踪中国经济数据发布的近半个世纪里，我从未遇到过推迟发布大量统计报告的情况，即使是在发生疫情和冲突时期也是如此，""曾任瑞银集团首席经济学家，现在是牛津大学中国中心研究员的乔治·马格努斯说。"
"Zhao Chenxin, the deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, had taken an upbeat tone about the Chinese economy during a news conference on Monday morning at the media center of the party congress.",国家发展和改革委员会副主任赵辰昕曾在二十大媒体中心周一上午举行的记者会上对中国经济表示乐观。
"""Judging from the current situation, the economy rebounded significantly in the third quarter from a global perspective, China's economic performance is still outstanding,"" he said.","""从目前掌握的情况看，三季度经济明显回升。从全球范围看，中国经济表现也依然突出，""他说。"
"After the close of trading on Chinese stock exchanges on Monday afternoon, the National Bureau of Statistics canceled its quarterly news conference, which had been scheduled for Tuesday morning, and updated its online calendar of data releases to show many categories as ""delayed.""","中国股市周一下午收盘后，国家统计局取消了原定于周二上午举行的季度数据发布会，更新了网上的统计信息发布日程表，把好几个类别数据的发布时间改为""延期""。"
"Another agency, the General Administration of Customs, had separately failed last Friday to follow its own previously issued schedule for the release of export and import statistics for September. The release of those numbers has also been delayed indefinitely.",上周五，另一个政府机构中国海关总署也未按照其事先公布的时间表发布9月份的进出口统计数据。这些数字的发布也已被无限期推迟。
"The delays come as Chinese officials have been trying to rebut growing criticisms from foreign economists and multinational corporations that China now puts politics and ideology ahead of economic performance. Mr. Zhao said on Monday morning that because of the government's pandemic policies and emphasis on economic development, ""China's economic stabilization and improvement will be further consolidated.""","推迟统计数据发布之际，中国官员们正试图反驳来自外国经济学家和跨国公司越来越多的批评，他们指责中国现在把政治和意识形态置于经济发展之上。赵辰昕曾在周一上午说，由于政府对""统筹疫情防控""政策的重视，""中国经济回稳向好的态势必将进一步巩固。"""
"Western economists had been predicting that China would announce on Tuesday morning that the economy grew a little more than 3 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. That would be better than growth of just 0.4 percent in the second quarter, when a two-month pandemic lockdown in Shanghai severely depressed many industries' output.",西方经济学家曾一直预测，中国会在周二上午宣布三季度经济与去年同期相比增幅略高于3%。这将好于二季度仅0.4%的增长率，上海曾在那个季度实行了为期两个月的新冠清零封控，导致许多行业的产出严重降低。
"But it would still be far below Beijing's target, set last March, that growth this year would be ""about 5.5 percent.""","但3%的增长率仍远低于中国政府今年3月制定的目标——今年的增长率为""5.5%左右""。"
"As China has grown to become the world's largest manufacturer and a major trading power, and home to some of the world's biggest banks, it has repeatedly struggled with how its Communist Party-dominated political structure communicates with financial markets.",中国已成为世界上最大的制造中心和主要贸易大国，也是世界上一些最大银行的所在地，但中国在发展过程中也在不断应对中共主导的政治结构与金融市场沟通方式制造的难题。
"For example, China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, announced with almost no explanation in August 2015 that it was devaluing the country's currency, the renminbi, by nearly 2 percent. The move was intended as a technical measure connected to bringing the renminbi into the International Monetary Fund's system of reserve currencies.",例如，2015年8月，中国人民银行在几乎没有任何解释的情况下宣布，将人民币贬值近2%。此举原本是与旨在将人民币纳入国际货币基金组织储备货币体系有关的一个技术措施。
"But the sudden move contributed considerably to a panic in financial markets in China and abroad that lasted into the following winter, driving down share prices in China and causing investors to move hundreds of billions of dollars out of the country.",但这种突如其来的举动在相当程度上加剧了中国和海外金融市场的恐慌，而且这种恐慌情绪一直持续到了第二年冬天，引发了中国股市的大跌，导致投资者将数千亿美元的资金转移到国外。
"It's the worst-kept secret in China. A crescendo of Communist Party adulation has left scant doubt that Xi Jinping will win a third term as party general secretary at the congress opening on Sunday, allowing him to enter a second decade of immense power.",这是中国最公开的秘密。随着共产党拥护他的呼声越来越高，几乎没有人怀疑习近平会在周日开幕的党代会上赢得第三个总书记任期，让他进入拥有巨大权力的第二个十年。
"No Chinese official, certainly not Mr. Xi, has confirmed that when the congress ends in about a week, he will be endorsed for that new five-year term by a meeting of senior officials. But the party elite's message this month that Mr. Xi is indispensable for China's continued rise speaks for itself, especially when there is no sign of an heir to him in the wings.",包括习近平在内，没有一位中国官员会证实当大会在约一周后结束时，这次高级别会议将批准他新的五年任期。但党内精英本月发出的信息是，习近平对中国持续崛起不可或缺，这表明连任已是不言而喻的事情，尤其是在没有他的继任者迹象的情况下。
"What is less clear is what Mr. Xi's extended rule will mean for China. Mr. Xi appears to believe that his continued power will give China policy continuity and political stability, avoiding a lame-duck period or succession strife. Others warn that the uncertainties over when, or even if, he may retire and give way to a successor could eventually sow instability. Pressure will build in coming years for Mr. Xi to offer a road map for eventually handing over to a younger generation.",尚不太清楚的是，习近平延长统治时间对中国意味着什么。习近平似乎相信，他持续掌权将给中国带来政策的连续性和政治稳定性，避免出现跛脚鸭时期或继承权的争夺。也有人警告，他何时退休，甚至会不会退休并让位给继任者，这些不确定性最终可能会播下不稳定的种子。未来几年，习近平将面临越来越大的压力，要为最终将权力移交给年轻一代提供路线图。
"""Ordinary citizens and private entrepreneurs are also wondering what direction the country will go. People want some clues,"" said Yuhua Wang, a professor of government at Harvard University. ""The uncertainties over succession can become more dangerous if the elites start to form sides and factions.""","""普通公民和民营企业家也想知道这个国家将走向何方。人们想要一些线索，""哈佛大学政府学教授王裕华说。""如果精英开始形成阵营和派系，继任的不确定性可能会变得更加危险。"""
"Mr. Xi is China's topmost leader because he has held a trinity of prominent posts for a decade: party general secretary, state president and chairman of China's military. His efforts to engineer a third term in power go back to at least 2018, when the national legislature abolished the two-term limit on the presidency. Neither the party post nor military chairmanship had a term limit, so that move opened the way for Mr. Xi to hold all three posts indefinitely.",习近平是中国最高领导人，因为十年来他担任着三个重要职位:党的总书记、国家主席和军委主席。他谋求第三个任期的努力至少可以追溯到2018年，当时国家立法机构取消了国家主席连任不得超过两届的限制。总书记和军委主席都没有任期限制，因此此举为习近平无限期担任这三个职务开辟了道路。
"In theory, Mr. Xi could hold onto his party and military posts, and hand the presidency to another official. But he appears eager to avoid the slightest doubt that he alone holds ultimate power, and is likely to be re-elected president next year. (He is all but certain to win another five years as military chairman after the party congress ends.)",理论上，习近平可以留住党职和军职，将国家主席职位交给其他人。但在独揽大权一事上，他似乎急于消除任何的不确定性，并且很可能会在明年连任国家主席。(党代会结束后，他几乎肯定会再赢得五年的军委主席职位。)
"When Mr. Xi walks out with his new leadership lineup on the day after the congress ends, much attention will fall on whether the lineup includes one or more potential successors. Most experts and insiders believe Mr. Xi will hold off from revealing one this time.",当习近平在大会结束后的第二天带着新领导班子走出来时，很多人都会关注这个阵容是否包括一个或多个潜在的继任者。大多数专家和业内人士认为，习近平这次不会透露这一点。
"""I don't think Xi wants attention taken away from him, and there are no obvious candidates,"" said Trey McArver, a political analyst with Trivium China, a company that monitors Chinese policymaking.","""我认为习近平不会想要注意力从他身上转移，而且没有明显的候选人，""跟进中国政策制定情况的策纬咨询公司的政治分析师罗杰(Trey McArver)表示。"
"BEIJING The congress was supposed to be a crowning moment for Xi Jinping as he sailed into a near-certain third term. But at his moment of triumph, the mood on the ground was less festive.",北京——习近平即将迎来第三个任期之际，这次党代会本应成为他的巅峰时刻。但在他的胜利时刻，社会上的情绪却并没有那么喜庆。
"In central Beijing on Sunday morning, traffic was scarce. At several major shopping centers with enormous outdoor LED panels including one more than 50 feet tall the screens, which often play the news, were black. A security guard standing below one said the screen had been turned off since the day before, though he didn't know why. He had also been expecting to see the congress broadcast there.",周日上午在北京市中心，车流稀少。在几个拥有巨大户外LED屏(其中一个超过15米高)的大型购物中心，经常播放新闻的屏幕现在处于黑屏状态。在其中一个屏幕下方站着的一名保安说，从前一天开始，屏幕就关了，但他也不知道原因。他原本还一直期待屏幕上会播放二十大直播。
"Politics is a rare topic of public discussion in China at any time, given heavy censorship and fear of retaliation for airing viewpoints that deviate from the official line. But the atmosphere was probably even more muted this year, both in Beijing and around the country, because of the authorities' extra determination to keep total control over this week's proceedings.",在中国，由于审查严密，而且人们担心发表偏离官方路线的观点会遭到报复，政治几乎从来不是一个公开讨论的话题。但今年，北京和全国各地的气氛可能更加沉默，因为当局进一步决心对本周的二十大会议过程保持全面控制。
"The government's fixation on a ""zero Covid"" policy reaffirmed by Mr. Xi in his speech on Sunday has trapped tens of millions of people in some form of lockdown in recent weeks and sapped economic growth. Many districts of Shanghai, which emerged from a bruising citywide lockdown only in June, have shuttered entertainment venues as cases resurge there. In Beijing, where cases are also spreading despite the government's determination to insulate the capital, the authorities have ordered some bars and restaurants to close indefinitely and stepped up checks on mandatory regular coronavirus tests.",习近平在周日的讲话中重申了政府对清零政策的坚持，最近几周，该政策使数千万人困在某种形式的封锁中，并拖累了经济的增长。上海在6月才从一次令人痛苦的封城中解脱出来，随着许多区重新出现病例，娱乐场所现已关闭。在北京，尽管政府决心不让疫情蔓延到首都，但病例仍在增加，当局已下令一些酒吧和餐馆无限期关门，并加强了对强制性定期核酸检测的检查。
"Police officers also blanketed the city in the days leading up to the congress, blocking most cars, bicyclists and pedestrians from some central thoroughfares, and stopping passers-by for identity checks. Their presence increased even further after a rare public protest on Thursday, in the form of two banners hung from a bridge, then quickly removed denouncing Mr. Xi.",在大会召开前的几天里，北京城里到处都是警察，在通往市中心的几条干道上，大多数汽车、自行车和行人都被禁止进入，路人会被拦下检查身份。周四发生了一次罕见的公开抗议活动，有人将两条谴责习近平的条幅挂在一座立交桥上，之后被迅速移除。此后当局进一步加强了警力部署。
Many Beijing residents seemed determined to avoid discussing the meeting.,许多北京居民似乎决心避免讨论这次会议。
"""In China, politics is like a closely guarded secret. People don't talk about it much, and also are unwilling to get swept up in it,"" Bruce Zheng, a public relations employee, said several days before the opening while visiting the Lama Temple, a popular attraction in central Beijing.","""国内的话，对政治属于一种讳莫如深的一个状态，大家不太谈政治，也不太愿意被政治所裹挟。""从事公关工作的布鲁斯·郑在会议前几天参观北京市中心的著名景点雍和宫时说。"
"""In the past, people would always say that Beijing taxi drivers loved to talk about politics,"" he added. ""Now, taxi drivers don't talk about politics. Nobody talks about politics.""","""过去老说北京出租车大爷特别爱聊政治，""他还说。""现在出租车大爷不聊政治，大家都不聊政治。"""
"At a popular park in Chaoyang District on Sunday, several people declined to speak with me about whether they had paid attention to news about the congress. One man agreed, but his daughter then objected, demanding that a recording of the conversation be deleted. Soon after the man and his daughter left, five police officers approached me, asking to see identification and questioning what I was doing in the park.",周日，在朝阳区一个热闹的公园里，几个人拒绝与我谈论他们是否关注了大会新闻。一名男子倒是同意了，但后来他的女儿提出反对，要求删除谈话录音。该男子和他的女儿离开后不久，五名警察走近我，要求查看身份证明并询问我来公园的目的。
"The contrast between the official heralding of the congress and the public's relative silence was also apparent online. The official Weibo accounts of the Yunnan police and Shanghai firefighters' departments shared photos of their employees studiously watching a broadcast of the opening ceremony. But room for regular social media users to share their thoughts was strictly limited. On Baidu Tieba, a popular discussion forum, a search for Mr. Xi's name produced an error message.",在网上，大会的官方宣传与公众相对沉默之间的对比十分鲜明。云南警方和上海消防部门的官方微博分享了职工认真观看开幕转播的照片。但普通社交媒体用户分享想法的空间受到严格限制。在热门论坛百度贴吧上，搜索习近平的名字得到的是一条检索错误的信息。
"On the Baidu search engine, the question ""How often does the general secretary change?"" returned no results.","在百度搜索引擎上，输入""总书记多久换届一次?""的问题没有返回任何结果。"
"Xi Jinping defended his hard-line reign on Sunday, presenting himself to a congress of China's ruling elite as the leader whose tough policies had saved the nation from the ravages of the pandemic and was now focused on securing China's rise amid multiplying global threats.",周日，习近平以最高领导人的身份在中国的统治精英代表大会上作出报告，为自己的强硬统治辩护，称他的强硬政策使国家免于新冠病毒大流行的破坏，并表示现在要集中精力确保国家在全球威胁接踵而至的环境下崛起。
"Mr. Xi, who is poised to claim a groundbreaking third term as leader at the end of the weeklong Communist Party congress, used his opening report to argue that his decade in power had brought historic gains. He pointed to the party's campaign against corrupt officials, its cleanup of the environment and its crackdown on antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong as key victories. He described Chinese foreign policy as a series of successes in fending off Western ""bullying"" and protectionism, apparently referring to disputes over human rights, technology and Beijing's claim on Taiwan.","为期一周的中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会结束时，习近平将迎来开创性的第三个领导人任期。他利用开幕式报告为自己执政十年给中国带来的历史性进步提供论据。他指出，中共打击贪官的运动、清理环境的努力，以及对香港反政府抗议者的镇压都是关键性的胜利。他声称，中国的外交政策在抵御西方""霸凌行径""和保护主义方面取得了一系列成功，这显然是指中国在人权、技术以及对台湾的主权主张方面与西方的争端。"
"But his praise was coupled with a somber warning that the nation must stand united behind the party to cope with a world he depicted as increasingly turbulent and hostile. And though he did not mention the United States by name, his distrust of the world's other great power was an unmistakable backdrop to that exhortation.",但除了这些赞扬外，他还发出了严厉警告，称国家必须在中共领导之下保持团结，以应对在他看来日益动荡和充满敌意的世界。尽管习近平没有提美国的名字，但他对世界另一个大国的不信任是发出这一警告的明显背景。
"""Be mindful of dangers in the midst of peace,"" Mr. Xi said. ""Get the house in good repair before rain comes, and prepare to undergo the major tests of high winds and waves, and even perilous, stormy seas.""","""居安思危，未雨绸缪，准备经受风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的重大考验，""习近平说。"
"Speaking to a hall filled with delegates in face masks, he made no concessions to critics who have argued that his relentless ""zero Covid"" policies of lockdowns, mass testing and intrusive surveillance have pushed China into a cul-de-sac of unsustainable restrictions and economic damage. He argued instead that such tough policies, and the party's dominance in nearly all aspects of everyday life, was what was needed to protect China's 1.4 billion people.",会场坐满了戴着口罩听他讲话的代表，习近平在讲话中没有对批评新冠清零政策的人做出任何让步，批评者认为他采取的封锁、大规模病毒检测，以及高度侵扰的监控等无情措施已将中国推进了不可持续的限制措施死胡同，损害了经济。相反，他认为，保护中国14亿人口需要这些强硬的政策，以及中共对人们日常生活几乎所有方面的主导。
"He outlined a vision of the Communist Party leading China toward superpower status, saying that sweeping mobilization by the state was needed to ward off international threats circling around China. He told the congress that he would push for faster homegrown technological innovation, and would upgrade China's already formidable domestic security apparatus.",他勾勒出共产党领导中国走向超级大国地位的愿景，称为了抵御中国面临的国际威胁，国家需要全面动员起来。他在二十大上表示，将推动更快的自主技术创新，并提升中国已经令人惧怕的国内安全机构。
"He called for China to exert further influence on world affairs directly and through institutions like the United Nations, while at the same time cautioning that the coming years would pose new challenges for his country.",他要求中国通过像联合国这样的机构对世界事务施加更大的直接影响，同时警告，未来几年将给他的国家带来新的挑战。
"Mr. Xi gave his keynote report less than a week after President Biden issued a long-awaited national security strategy, which identified China as a threat to American security and global primacy. But as is usual for party leaders' big speeches to congress, Mr. Xi did not mention the United States, nor did he say anything about Russia's floundering invasion of Ukraine. Still, Chinese officials were expected to draw from Mr. Xi's speech a warning to stand up to Washington over issues like recent American restrictions on the export of semiconductor technology to China and American support for Taiwan.",习近平在二十大开幕式上发表讲话不到一周前，美国总统拜登发布了人们期待已久的国家安全战略，确定了中国是对美国国家安全和全球首要地位的威胁。但按照中共领导人在公开会议上发表长篇讲话的惯例，习近平没有提美国，也没有提俄罗斯在入侵乌克兰战争中的失利。尽管如此，预计官员们会从习近平的讲话中得到告诫，在美国最近限制向中国出口半导体技术，以及美国对台湾的支持等问题上要与华盛顿对抗。
"""His stance this morning showed that U.S.-China confrontation will continue,"" said Willy Lam, a longtime analyst of Chinese politics in Hong Kong who is a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation. ""Every time Xi Jinping speaks, he emphasizes the increasingly complicated and harsh international climate, and the implication is clear.""","""他今天上午的立场表明，美中对抗将继续下去，""在香港长期研究中国政治的分析师、詹姆斯敦基金会高级研究员林和立说。""习近平在每次讲话都强调日益复杂和严峻的国际形势，言下之意是显而易见的。"""
"In a sign of Mr. Xi's singular focus on stifling perceived threats to China and party rule, Mr. Xi's full report mentioned ""national security"" 26 times, more even than the 18 times in his longer report to the 2017 congress. In a congress report given by Mr. Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, a decade ago, ""national security"" got four mentions.","习近平在报告全文中26次提到""国家安全""，超出了他在2017年所作的篇幅更长的十九大报告中的18次，这表明习近平的精力异常集中于压制他认为对中国和中共统治的威胁上。习近平的前任胡锦涛在十年前的十八大报告中仅四次提到""国家安全""。"
"The message behind Mr. Xi's rhetoric was that China must ""continue to circle the wagons that a strong party leadership is necessary to fend off these increasing external threats,"" said William Klein, a former U.S. diplomat with long experience with China who now works for FGS Global. ""There's a broad, stable, near-consensus majority in China now that truly believes the United States has the intention to disrupt China's modernization drive.""","习近平讲话背后的信息是，中国必须""继续团结一致，中共的强有力领导对抵御这些日益增长的外部威胁是必要的""，美国前外交官柯有为(William Klein)说，他有在中国长期工作的经验，现在为咨询公司富捷思国际工作。""中国现在大多数人中有一种广泛、稳定、近乎一致的共识，他们对美国有意破坏中国的现代化进程确信无疑。"""
"Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has built a powerful security apparatus that employs extensive networks of cameras and other surveillance equipment, backed by artificial intelligence, to monitor dissent online and on the streets. Threats, in Mr. Xi's view, exist everywhere not just enemies at the border, but in subversive ideas in classrooms and museums.",自2012年上台以来，习近平已建起了一个强大的安全监控网，利用无处不在的摄像头和其他监控设备，在人工智能的支持下监视网上和街头的异见。在习近平眼里，威胁无处不在，不仅来自境外的敌人，还来自教室里和博物馆里的颠覆性思想。
"""The systems for safeguarding national security were inadequate,"" Mr. Xi said in describing the situation when he took power. ""National security is the foundation of national rejuvenation.""","""维护国家安全的制度不健全，""习近平在描述他上台时的情况时说。""国家安全是民族复兴的根基。"""
"Mr. Xi also repeated China's longstanding demand that Taiwan, the self-governed island democracy of 24 million people, accept unification under Beijing. He reiterated that China wanted to gain Taiwan peacefully, but would never rule out force, which he said could be needed against external intervention a clear reference to the United States and its allies. Tensions over Taiwan rose significantly in August when Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, visited the island and China launched intimidating military exercises.",习近平还重申了中国长期以来的要求，即拥有2400万人口的自治民主岛屿台湾接受与中国的统一。他重申，中国希望以和平方式收复台湾，但绝不会排除使用武力，他说如果有外部干预的话，可能需要动用武力，这显然是指美国及其盟友。美国众议院议长佩洛西今年8月访问台湾后，中国发起恐吓性军事演习，曾让台湾的紧张局势显著升级。
"""'America' was not mentioned from the beginning to the end, but almost everything points to America,"" said Wang Hsin-hsien, a professor who specializes in Chinese politics at the National Chengchi University in Taipei, said of Mr. Xi's comments.","""从头都没有出现美国这两个字，但是每一件事几乎都指向美国，""台北国立政治大学专门研究中国政治的教授王信贤在谈到习近平的讲话时说。"
"The policy implications of Mr. Xi's report will take time to become clearer, as his broad rhetoric is converted into policy proposals and legislation. But some of the most immediate consequences may be in China's tech sector, which Mr. Xi said must step up efforts to master key technologies crucial for economic and military competition. Mr. Xi's comments suggested that the state, not private industry, would guide key initiatives.",习近平的报告对未来政策的影响还需要假以时日才会变得清晰，这要看他的泛泛之谈如何变成政策提案和立法。但一些最直接的后果可能是在中国的科技行业，习近平说中国必需加快步伐，掌握对经济和军事竞争至关重要的关键技术。习近平在讲话中暗示，指导关键项目的是国家，而不是私营企业。
"""He is doubling down on state-led innovation and trying to throw a bone to the country's innovative tech elite to assure them that they still matter, but the new incentives are not clear,"" said Paul Triolo, a China and tech policy expert at Albright Stonebridge Group.","""他正在加倍坚定地推进国家主导的创新，虽然他试图给国内有创新精神的科技精英们施以小惠，让他们觉得国家仍需要他们，但会有哪些新激励措施尚不清楚，""奥尔布赖特石桥集团的中国和科技政策专家保罗·特廖洛说。"
"When Mr. Xi turned his attention to China's domestic economy, struggling with a painful slowdown and job losses this year, his proposals were more cautiously and vaguely worded, suggesting some desire to avoid alarming domestic and foreign investors.",习近平在讲话中把注意力转向中国国内经济时，他的说法更为谨慎和含糊，暗示了一些避免惊动国内外投资者的愿望。中国今年面临着痛苦的经济放缓和失业问题。
"He committed himself once more to his theme of ""common prosperity,"" a longtime Communist Party slogan that Mr. Xi has adopted as his response to China's huge gulf between rich and poor. But Mr. Xi continued to avoid defining what the policy might entail.","习近平再次提到致力于""共同富裕""的目标，他已把中共这个长期以来的口号作为对中国巨大贫富差距问题的回应。但习近平继续避免界定该政策可能包含的内容。"
"He steered clear of any mention of introducing an inheritance tax, a tax on investment gains or a national tax on real estate three measures long suggested by economists as ways to rebalance wealth and the overall economy. Mr. Xi spoke instead of the need to help people find jobs, and of the intrinsic value of hard work.",他对引入遗产税、投资收益税，或在全国范围内征收房地产税的问题避而不提，经济学家们一直建议用这些措施实现财富再分配和平衡整体经济。习近平只提了帮助人民找工作的必要性，以及努力工作的内在价值。
"""It gives priority to employment that is, not a welfare state,"" said Bert Hofman, a former China director of the World Bank who is now the director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore.","""把就业作为优先事务考虑，也就是说，不建立福利国家，""曾任世界银行中国区主任、现任新加坡国立大学东亚研究所所长的郝福满(Bert Hofman)说。"
"Mr. Xi also gave a very brief mention to ""dual circulation,"" his stance that China should rely primarily on its domestic economy for growth while also maintaining a separate engine of international trade. Foreign governments and multinational corporations have worried that the concept could be a formula for reserving the domestic market for Chinese companies.","习近平还非常简短地提到了""双循环""，他提出，中国应该主要依靠国内市场增长经济，同时将国际贸易作为另外的一个经济增长引擎加以保持。外国政府和跨国公司担心，该设想可能是为了把中国市场留给中国公司。"
"Even as Mr. Xi was doubling down on policies that critics have said are hurting China's global and economic stature, the effects of those policies were playing out in real time.",就在习近平加倍坚持被批评人士称为正在损害中国全球地位和经济地位的政策时，这些政策的现实影响正在实时发生中。
"As Mr. Xi described the country's zero-Covid policy as a successful ""all-out people's war,"" making clear that the government had no plans to shift from it soon, tens of millions of people across China were under some form of movement restriction.","习近平把中国的新冠清零政策描述为一场成功的""全面人民战争""，这清楚地表明，政府没有很快改变这个政策的计划，中国各地目前有数以千万计的人受到某种形式的行动限制。"
"Many districts of Shanghai, which emerged from a bruising citywide lockdown only in June, have shuttered entertainment venues as cases resurge there. In Beijing, where cases are also spreading despite the government's determination to insulate the capital, the authorities have ramped up checks on mandatory regular coronavirus tests. Traffic was thin on Sunday morning in the city center, and normally bustling malls quiet.",在今年6月才解除了封城的上海，随着当地许多社区的确诊病例再现增势，娱乐场所已经关闭。在北京，尽管政府下大力气不让疫情蔓延到首都，但确诊病例数也在增长，当局加强了对强制性定期核酸检测的核查。周日上午，北京市中心车辆稀少，平时熙熙攘攘的商场没有多少人。
"The authorities' strict controls on the internet, which Mr. Xi hailed on Sunday as successfully bringing about ""fundamental transformation in the ideological sphere,"" have dissuaded many Chinese from speaking about politics, online or offline. Despite ample propaganda about the party congress in the capital, residents seemed determined to avoid weighing in on the proceedings.","在周日的报告中，习近平称赞当局对互联网的严格控制成功地实现了""意识形态领域的根本转变""。这让许多中国人不敢在网上或者线下谈论政治。虽然当局对二十大在北京召开进行了大量宣传，但居民们似乎决意避免对二十大的召开发表任何看法。"
"""In China, politics is like a closely guarded secret. People don't talk about it much, and also are unwilling to get swept up in it,"" said Bruce Zheng, a Beijing resident who works in public relations.","""在中国，政治就像是一个严格保守的秘密。人们很少谈论它，也不想卷入其中，""从事公关工作的北京居民布鲁斯·郑说。"
"""In the past, people would always say that Beijing taxi drivers loved to talk about politics,"" he added. ""Now, taxi drivers don't talk about politics. Nobody talks about politics.""","""过去，人们总说北京的出租车司机喜欢谈论政治，""他补充道。""现在，出租车司机们也不谈政治了。没有人谈论政治。"""
"The contrast between the official heralding of the congress and the public's relative silence was also apparent online. The official Weibo accounts of the Yunnan police and Shanghai fire departments shared photographs of their employees studiously watching a broadcast of the opening ceremony. But room for regular users to share their thoughts was strictly limited. On Baidu Tieba, a popular discussion forum, a search for Mr. Xi's name produced an error message.",官方对二十大的大肆宣传与公众的相对沉默的对比在网上也很明显。云南警方和上海消防部门都在自己的官方微博号上分享了员工们认真观看开幕式转播的照片。但普通用户分享想法的空间受到严格限制。在百度贴吧上检索习近平的名字，得到的是一条检索错误的信息。
"BEIJING They lounge in folding chairs, perch on traffic bollards or pace small circles to keep warm. They are stationed every 100 feet or so, keeping watch over their designated patch of Beijing street. Their bright red wind-breakers and matching armbands spell out their roles as ""Neighborhood Security Volunteers.""","北京——他们坐在折叠椅上，靠着交通指示灯柱，或是绕圈走动取暖。每隔30米左右就有他们在站岗，监视着他们所负责的北京街道。他们鲜红色的防风衣和配套的袖章表明了他们的身份——""社区治安志愿者""。"
"Their mission is straightforward: guarantee that nothing disrupts an all-important Chinese Communist Party congress that begins Sunday, where the top leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to claim a third term.",他们的任务很简单:保证周日召开的意义重大的中共党代会不受任何扰乱，最高领导人习近平预计将在大会上获得第三个任期。
"The volunteers, who have blanketed Beijing in recent days, are perhaps the most obvious element of the security blockade that China has imposed on the city. In a country where control is paramount, every preparation is designed to ensure that any perceived threat or wrinkle from the coronavirus to unsightly litter is eliminated.",这样的志愿者近来在北京随处可见，他们可能是中国对这所城市实施的安全封锁中最显眼的元素。在这个控制至上的国家，每项准备工作都是为了确保消除任何潜在的威胁或隐患，从新冠病毒到脏乱垃圾都不例外。
The authorities have also blocked anyone who has traveled to an area with even one coronavirus infection from entering the city. Postal officials must check the identification documents of everyone mailing anything to Beijing.,当局还禁止任何有新冠感染地区旅居史的人进入这座城市。任何人向北京邮寄任何东西都会被邮政官员检查身份证明。
"Local officials have pledged that the volunteers, working alongside militia members and security officers, will sniff out ""unstable elements,"" such as people with complaints against the government, and ""weave a tight and three-dimensional web of social prevention and control.""","地方官员承诺，志愿者将与民兵和安全人员一道，揪出""不稳定因素""，比如上访投诉政府的人，并要""织严织密立体化社会防控网络""。"
"""Until the big meeting is over, there will be more people patrolling. Police, all kinds,"" one volunteer in her 50s, Li Wenge, said as she hunched on a stool near Beijing's 13th-century Drum Tower, watching a group of middle-aged men play roller hockey.","""在大会结束前，巡视的人会更多。警察，各种各样的都有，""年过五十的志愿者李文革(音)说，在建于13世纪的北京鼓楼附近，她弓背坐在一张凳子上，看一群中年男人打轮滑曲棍球。"
"Ms. Li motioned to her right, where two red-clad figures sat at the tower's foot, then her left, as another pair strolled by. ""We're all over this place.""","李文革指了指她的右边，塔楼底下坐了两名红衣人，然后又指了指左边，另外两名红衣人正好经过。""到处都是我们这样的。"""
"The meeting, officially called the 20th National Congress, is a secretive, once-every-five-years conclave where the country's next leaders are anointed. During his 10 years in power, Mr. Xi has consolidated authority more completely than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. He has largely wiped out independent civil society, imprisoned human rights lawyers and expanded state surveillance into evermore corners of daily life.","这场会议的正式名称叫做""中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会""，是每五年举行一次的首脑选举会议，将指定中国的下一届领导人。在掌权的十年间，习近平比毛泽东以来的任何一位中国领导人都更彻底地巩固了权威。他在很大程度上消灭了独立的公民社会，监禁人权律师，并将国家监视扩大到了日常生活的更多角落。"
The fortress around Beijing as he prepares for a precedent-defying five more years crystallizes how successful he has been.,在他将要迎来打破先例的又一个五年任期之际，北京周边的森严壁垒清楚表明了他的成功。
"Officials in other provinces have pledged any necessary measures, including lockdowns, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, ""especially to Beijing."" In the capital, armed officers patrol the streets around the Great Hall of the People, where Mr. Xi is set to speak on Sunday, and stop bicyclists and pedestrians for random checks.","其他省份的官员已承诺将采取包括封城在内的一切必要措施，防止新冠病毒的传播，""尤其不能外溢到北京。""在首都，武装官兵在人民大会堂附近的街道巡逻，习近平定于周日在这里发表讲话，骑行者和行人也都会被随机拦下检查。"
"An official with the Ministry of Public Security announced at a news conference last month that the authorities had arrested more than 1.4 million criminal suspects nationwide since the end of June, helping to ""create a safe and stable political and social environment for the successful convening of the 20th Party Congress.""","公安部一名官员上月在新闻发布会上宣布，自6月底以来，当局在全国范围内抓捕违法犯罪嫌疑人超过140万名，""为党的二十大胜利召开创造安全稳定的政治社会环境""。"
"All but the most effusive sentiment about the government must be kept at bay, too hence the profusion of propaganda that has appeared on bridges, on billboards, in 60-foot-tall flower arrangements. The longer the slogan, the more inspiring, the thinking seems to go. ""Unite More Closely Around the Party's Central Committee That Has Comrade Xi Jinping As Its Core, Take Practical Steps to Welcome the Successful Convening of the 20th National Congress,"" reads one mega-screen above a department store.","除了最热情洋溢的赞美，对政府的所有情绪都必须克制——因此，桥梁上、广告牌上、18米高的花篮装饰上满是宣传标语。当局似乎认为，口号越长就越能鼓舞人心。""更加紧密团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，以实际行动迎接党的二十大胜利召开，""一处百货商场上方的大屏幕打出了这样的标语。"
"Discontent may still seethe below the surface. On Thursday, it appeared to spill over, as photos circulated on social media of two banners unfurled on a Beijing overpass, calling for an end to coronavirus lockdowns and the overthrow of Mr. Xi.",不满情绪可能依然波涛暗涌。周四，不满似乎蔓延开来，社交媒体上流传着关于北京一座立交桥的图片，桥上的两条横幅要求结束新冠封锁，并推翻习近平的统治。
"Public protest especially directly attacking Mr. Xi is virtually unseen in the city on any day, and nearly unimaginable amid the pre-congress security thicket. The authorities quickly moved to quash it. Police officers descended on the bridge, and online censors scrubbed the photos from Chinese social media. Even a search for the word ""Beijing"" seemed to have been restricted on the platform Weibo, with only posts from verified official accounts appearing.","公开抗议——特别是直接攻击习近平——在这座城市基本不可能成为现实，在二十大前的天罗地网中几乎是不可想象的。当局迅速采取行动予以镇压。警察赶到桥上，网络审查者也从中国社交媒体上删除了照片。就连""北京""这个词在微博平台上的搜索似乎都受到了限制，仅能看到官方认证账号所发的内容。"
"But that outburst was an exception. The paradox of politics in China is that, despite the ubiquity of propaganda, few people publicly discuss the subject. Even as banners urge residents to overflow with joy at the congress's arrival, hardly anyone talks about the content of the meeting itself and what it might mean for the country's future. Such questions are considered too sensitive, or simply too far from ordinary people's control.",但那样的爆发是一次例外。中国政治的悖论在于，尽管政治宣传无孔不入，但很少有人公开讨论这个话题。虽然标语都在敦促市民热烈欢迎二十大的到来，但几乎没有人谈论大会本身的内容，以及它对国家的未来可能意味着什么。这类问题被认为太过敏感，或者说离普通人太远了。
"Still, seemingly everyone is talking about the meeting for a different reason: how disruptive it has been to daily life.",尽管如此，人人都在谈论这次大会似乎另有其因:那就是它给日常生活带来了多大的干扰。
"At coffee shops, friends complain that their employers barred them from leaving Beijing during the seven-day National Day vacation last week usually one of China's busiest travel seasons for fear that they would not be able to return.",在咖啡店，朋友间抱怨称，雇主在上周为期七天的国庆假期——这通常是中国人流量最大的旅游季——期间禁止他们离开北京，因为担心他们回不来。
"Walking down the street, passers-by grouse about being ordered to do extra coronavirus tests. Police officers have abruptly shut down nightclubs and restaurants, at times indefinitely, citing the need to be extra vigilant against the coronavirus.",走在街上，路人抱怨着做额外的核酸检测的命令。警察突然关闭了夜店和餐馆，有时还是无限期关闭，理由是需要对新冠病毒保持格外警惕。
"The words ""party congress"" have become a sort of catchall explanation for any inconvenience or interruption.","""二十大""一词成了对一切不便或干扰的笼统解释。"
"""Some small things will remind you. Your packages don't come, and then you'll remember, 'The party congress is coming,'"" Chen Yaran, a college student in Beijing, said.","""一些小事会提醒你。你的快递到不了，然后你就会想起，'二十大要来了，'""北京一名大学生陈雅然(音)说道。"
"Ms. Chen was resting in a courtyard of the 300-year-old Lama Temple, an elegant Tibetan-style monastery and one of Beijing's most popular tourist sites, on the last day of the holiday. Her university, like many others in the city, had shortened the break to discourage students from leaving the city. Unable to go home to see her grandmother, Ms. Chen had settled for a visit to the temple, where she joined dozens of others in lighting bundles of incense and wishing for better days.",假期的最后一天，陈雅然在有300多年历史的雍和宫的院落中休息，这是一座优雅的藏传佛教寺院，也是北京最受欢迎的旅游景点之一。和这座城市的许多其他大学一样，她就读的大学缩短假期，以阻止学生离市。因为不能回家看望祖母，陈雅然决定去雍和宫逛逛，在那里，她和另外一群人一起上香祈福。
Movement in and out of Beijing has been regulated since the pandemic began. But the authorities tightened restrictions even more as the congress neared.,自疫情以来，进京出京一直受到管制。但随着二十大临近，当局更加收紧了限制。
"Current rules dictate that anyone who has spent time in an area with a single Covid infection cannot access their Beijing health code, a mobile app that all passengers must show before boarding planes or trains to the capital. Instead, such travelers opening the app are greeted by a warning telling them to stay in an infection-free place for one week.",目前的规定要求，任何人只要到过出现新冠病例的地区，就不能访问他们的北京健康码，而所有乘客在登上前往首都的飞机或火车前都必须出示该移动应用。现在，这样的旅客在打开该应用程序时就会收到一条警告，告诉他们要在无感染的地方待上一周时间。
"As the holiday week wound down, Chinese social media erupted with people complaining that they had received such warnings. China is recording a new surge in cases, but many stranded users said they had not traveled to risky areas. So many people shared angry or exasperated posts some saying they needed to return urgently for work or surgery that a hashtag about the pop-up was censored on Weibo.",随着假期周的结束，中国社交媒体上全是人们对于收到此类警告的抱怨。中国出现了新的感染激增，但很多被滞留的用户都说他们没有到过风险地区。太多人分享了生气或愤怒的内容——有些人说他们急着工作或手术——以至于微博审查了关于弹窗的话题。
"""Incredible: Entering China from abroad and entering Beijing are equally difficult,"" Ze Pingzhou, a comedian stuck in the southern city of Shenzhen, wrote on Weibo.","""神奇吧，入境和进京在难度上竟然没有差别，""被困在南方城市深圳的喜剧演员泽平周在微博上写道。"
"Officials have not released updated statistics for the holiday week, but state media predicted beforehand that fewer than 300,000 passengers would pass through Beijing Capital International Airport during that period less than a third of the number the year before.",官方尚未公布假日周的最新统计数据，但此前官媒预估，国庆期间北京首都国际机场的客流量将不足30万人次，还不到去年的三分之一。
"There is perhaps one phrase that has been repeated more often than ""party congress"" : ""after the party congress.""","或许有句话的使用频率比""二十大""更频繁，那就是""二十大以后""。"
"Residents recite it like an incantation, reassuring others or themselves that things will improve. The organizer of a dance show said the performance would pause in October but most likely restart afterward. Owners of shuttered bars look to the end of the month for hope of reopening.",市民们像念咒一样念叨这句话，安慰他人或自己，情况会好起来的。一出舞蹈表演的组织方表示，表演将在10月暂停，但很可能会在那之后恢复。停业酒吧的老板都寄望于月底能重新开张。
"Other postponements are more explicitly political. University professors say they cannot meet foreign reporters, even for informal conversations, until after the congress. Human rights lawyers expect the minders posted outside their homes to leave then.",其他被耽搁的问题则更明显是出于政治原因。大学教授均表示，在大会结束前，他们都不能与外国记者见面，连非正式谈话都不行。人权律师则预计，在他们家门外把守的人将会在大会后离开。
Even those eager to participate in party congress fervor may find themselves hampered temporarily by the careful choreography the meeting has brought.,即使是那些渴望参与二十大狂热的人，也可能发现自己的行动暂时受到了这场大会精心安排的阻碍。
"Two weeks ago, Mr. Xi toured an exhibit erected in honor of the congress at the Beijing Exhibition Center, called ""Bravely Advancing Toward a New Era."" The display, according to glowing state media reports, showed the achievements of the past 10 years Mr. Xi's time in power and included items as disparate as an air quality map and Olympic mascots. One report declared that the exhibit had become a popular online 'check-in' spot.","两周前，习近平在北京展览馆参观了一场为庆祝二十大而举办的""奋进新时代""展览。据官媒的歌颂报道，此次展览展示了过去十年——也就是习近平的掌权期——取得的成就，展出了空气质量图和奥运吉祥物等全然不同的展品。一篇报道宣称该展览已经成为热门网络""打卡""点。"
"But at the entrance to the exhibit, a security guard said it was open only to select groups. Asked when the public could visit, he shrugged.",但在展览入口处，一名保安表示，它只对部分团体开放。当被问及公众何时能参观时，他耸了耸肩。
"""I'd guess after the party congress,"" he said.","""我猜要到二十大以后了，""他说。"
"In his first years as China's leader, Xi Jinping paid for his own steamed dumplings in a cheap diner, casually rolled up his trouser legs to avoid splashes in the rain, and was serenaded with sugary pop tunes. His image-makers cast him as ""Xi Dada,"" the people's firm but genial ""Uncle Xi.""","在担任中国领导人的最初几年里，习近平会去廉价餐馆自己掏钱买包子吃，大大咧咧把裤管卷起以免被雨水溅到，人们用甜腻的流行小曲称颂他。他的形象设计者将他塑造成""习大大""——人民心中的一位坚定而和蔼的""习伯伯""。"
"How vastly different now. A decade on, Mr. Xi looms over the country like a stern Communist monarch, reflecting on China's fallen ancient dynasties and determined to win its lasting ascendancy in a turbulent world.",这跟现在是天差地别。十年后，习近平像一个严厉的共产主义君王，凌驾于这个国家之上，他反思中国古代那些覆灭的王朝，决心在一个动荡的世界里实现江山永固的伟业。
"Chinese officials praise his speeches like hallowed texts, professing loyalty with a fervor that sometimes echoes Mao Zedong's era. Privately mocking Mr. Xi can lead to prison. His public encounters are regimented displays of acclaim.",中国官员像对待神圣的经文一般赞美他的讲话，表忠心的狂热言语有时让人想到毛泽东时代。私下里贬损习近平可能会惹来牢狱之灾。在公开场合与他见面，需要按照事先的编排表达对他的赞扬。
"A Communist Party congress opening Sunday is shaping up to be Mr. Xi's imperial moment, strengthening and extending his rule, while also intensifying the long-term hazards from his singular dominance. At the meeting in Beijing, he seems sure of winning a third term as the party's general secretary, breaking with recent expectations that Chinese leaders would reign for around a decade.",本周日开幕的中共全国代表大会，看起来将成为习近平走上帝位的时刻，让他的统治得到加固和延续，同时也加剧他的一人独大带来的长期风险。在这场于北京举行的会议中，他似乎可以肯定会得到中共中央总书记的第三个任期，这与过去一段时间里的惯例——即中国每十年左右更换一次领导人——是相悖的。
"""The certainty will really only be in the arrangements at the topmost level, that his power is beyond challenge, but beneath that we'll face a great many uncertainties,"" Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said in an interview.","""这确定性实际上只是在最高层安排的确定性，就是他的权力是不可挑战的，但是我们在这种确定性之下我们就会面临大量的不确定性，""身在北京的政治分析人士吴强在采访中说。"
"The evolution of Mr. Xi's public face has paralleled his transformation of China into a proudly authoritarian state, scornful of criticism from Washington, increasingly sure that Western democracy has lost its allure, and impatient for a bigger say in shaping the 21st-century global order.",习近平的公众形象的演变与他将中国转变为一个更自豪的威权国家的过程是相呼应的，这个国家对华盛顿的批评不屑一顾，越来越确信西式民主已经失去了光环，迫不及待地想在21世纪全球秩序的塑造中掌握更多话语权。
"The party congress will be Mr. Xi's stage to demonstrate that he remains undaunted, despite the recent economic malaise, Covid outbreaks and increasing animosity with the United States, which has labeled China a national security threat. He is likely to tell the 2,296 congress delegates that his government has saved many lives through its strict ""zero Covid"" policy; shifted the economy onto a path of cleaner, fairer and more efficient growth; raised China's international standing; and made big strides in military modernization.","党代会将是习近平的舞台，用来证明他仍然无所畏惧，尽管近年面临着经济困局、新冠疫情以及美国越来越明确的敌意，后者已经将中国定性为国家安全威胁。他很可能会对2296位代表说，他的政府通过严厉的""清零""政策挽救了大量生命;让经济转向了一条更清洁、更公平、更高效的增长道路;提升了中国在国际上的地位;在军事现代化上取得重大进展。"
"""He wants to show that he's determined to do big things,"" said Neil Thomas, an analyst of Chinese politics for the Eurasia Group. ""He sees his historical role as breaking the historical cycle of dynastic rise and fall so the Communist Party remains in power pretty much forever.""","""他想证明自己有做大事的决心，""欧亚集团中国政治分析师尼尔·托马斯说。""他认为自己的历史使命是打破王朝兴衰的历史周期，让中国共产党永远掌权。"""
"Mr. Xi, 69, presents himself as the history-steeped guardian of China's destiny. He cites the toppling of China's ancient empires, determined to ensure that it does not again fall prey to political decay, revolt or foreign aggression. He quotes advice to emperors on ensuring obedience, ""like the arm commands the finger.""","现年69岁的习近平将自己塑造成一个深谙历史的中国命运守卫者。他以中国古代帝王的覆灭为鉴，一心要确保这个国家不再成为政治腐化、叛乱或外敌入侵的牺牲品。他引用了古人向皇帝的谏言""如臂使指""来说明该如何确保人民的服从。"
"He has taken to using a grand, ancient-sounding Chinese motto, guo zhi da zhe: roughly meaning ""the nation's great cause."" It sounds like it could have been passed down from a sage; in fact, Mr. Xi or his advisers minted it in 2020.","他使用了一句宏大的、有古文味道的格言""国之大者"":大致意思是""国家的重大目标""。听起来像是世代流传的至理名言，实际上是习近平或他的顾问在2020年创造的。"
"Mr. Xi is already looking well beyond the next five years, trying to build a lasting edifice of power and policies. He is fleshing out his own creed and promoting cohorts of younger proteges, technocrats and military commanders who may advance his influence for decades. Entrenching his central status was of ""decisive significance"" for China's rise, said a gathering of senior officials preparing for the congress.","习近平的目光并不止于未来五年，他试图建立一个持久的权力与政策大厦。他正在令自己的信条进一步丰满，并提拔一批年轻的门生、技术专家和军事指挥官，这些人可能会在几十年内提升他的影响力。准备参加大会的高级官员表示，巩固他的中心地位对中国的崛起具有""决定性意义""。"
"""Xi Jinping wants to show that he isn't just a party leader but also almost a spiritual seer for China a bold, visionary statesman,"" said Feng Chongyi, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney who studies recent Chinese political history.","""习近平是想证明他不只一个政党领袖而几乎也是中国一个精神导师，一个雄才大略(的人)，""悉尼科技大学研究中国近代政治史的副教授冯崇义说。"
"Surrounded by deferential functionaries, Mr. Xi may become more prone to swaggering oversteps. Unanswered questions over how long he will stay in power, and when he will name a successor, could unsettle officials, investors and other governments. Most experts believe he will not assign an heir at this congress, wary of undercutting his authority.",在顺从的职能部门簇拥下，习近平可能会更倾向于公然越权行事。关于他将执政多长时间以及他何时指定继任者的问题尚未得到回答，这可能会使官员、投资者和其他政府感到不安。大多数专家认为，他不会在这次大会上指定继承人，因为他害怕削弱自己的权威。
"If China's growth continues to stumble, Mr. Xi may have less largess for big technological programs and marquee projects like Xiong'an, an unfinished city of neat boulevards and office blocks outside of Beijing whose design exemplifies his ideas of an orderly, advanced society. It will also add to strains on his economic agenda, which has prioritized the state's interests to the frustration of private investors.",如果中国的经济增长继续下滑，习近平可能会减少对大型技术项目和雄安等标志性项目的投入，雄安是北京郊区一座由整齐的林荫道和办公大楼组成的未完工城市，其设计体现了他对有序、先进社会的想法。这也将为他的经济议程增加压力，该议程优先考虑国家利益，给私人投资者带来困扰。
"""We're still not in an era where the economy and society totally obey him,"" Mr. Wu said. ""The strains and tensions between politics and economics in the next five years will be more serious than the previous decade.""","""经济社会还不是完全听从他的一个时代，""吴强说。""未来五年政治经济之间这种矛盾紧张会比过去十年更严重。"""
"One day after Mr. Xi was first appointed party leader in November 2012, dozens of professors, lawyers and retired officials gathered in a Beijing hotel, urging China's new government to take up political liberalization as a cure for corruption and abuses. ""Democracy, rule of law, human rights and constitutional government are the unstoppable global tide,"" their petition said.","2012年11月，习近平首次被任命为党的领导人后的一天，数十名教授、律师和退休官员聚集在北京一家酒店，敦促中国的新政府把政治自由化作为治疗腐败和滥用权力的良方。他们的请愿书上写道:""民主、法治、人权、宪政是不可阻挡的世界潮流。"""
"After decades climbing the administrative ladder in brashly commercial coastal areas, Mr. Xi took power amid widespread expectations that he would be a pragmatist willing to tolerate, if not act on, such calls. Many pointed to the probable influence of his father, an official who served under Deng Xiaoping as the country was embarking on market reforms and opening up in the 1980s.",几十年来，习近平一直在高度商业化的沿海地区官场往上爬，因此人们普遍认为他会是一个务实主义者，即使不采取行动，也愿意容忍这种呼声。许多人指出，他的父亲在20世纪80年代中国开始进行市场改革和开放时，曾在邓小平手下任职，这也可能产生影响。
"Mr. Xi's initial promises of a ""China Dream"" were opaque enough to lift some hopes. But political insiders quickly began to sense Mr. Xi's hard-line direction, especially after scornful comments in late 2012 about former Soviet reformers.","习近平对""中国梦""的最初承诺并不分明，足以唤起一些希望。但政界内部人士很快开始感觉到习近平的强硬方向，特别是在2012年底他对前苏联改革者发表轻蔑的评论之后。"
"""Those retired liberal cadres began to think, 'He's really not going to be one of us',"" said Professor Feng, the Sydney academic, who was in Beijing when Mr. Xi's comments spread.","""那些退休的自由派干部开始觉得，'他的确不会成为我们中的一员'""悉尼学者冯崇义说，习近平上述言论传开时他正在北京。"
"Five months later, Mr. Xi issued an edict condemning human rights and rule of law, which he deemed to be vehicles for Western-backed subversion. Step by step since, he has silenced dissent and erected a pervasive national security apparatus to defend the party and himself.",五个月后，习近平发布了一项谴责人权和法治的法令，他认为这些都是受西方支持的颠覆工具。此后，他一步步压制异议，建立了一个无孔不入的国家安全机构来保卫党和他自己。
"Ten years on, the Beijing magazine that organized the 2012 meeting has been purged. Many older officials who signed the petition have since died; a businessman who put his name to it was imprisoned; other attendees have retreated into silence or embraced Mr. Xi's agenda.",十年过去了，北京那家曾组织2012年会议的杂志已被清洗。许多在请愿书上签名的老干部已去世;一位在请愿书上签名的商人被关进监狱;其他参与者则不再发声，或接受了习近平的议程。
"In Mr. Xi's worldview, the party is the custodian of traditional Chinese hierarchy and discipline, set against the dysfunction of democracies. He argues that the party's centralized power can mobilize China to accomplish feats beyond the grasp of Western countries, like cutting rural poverty, leaping into new technologies, or so it seemed for a while efficiently halting the spread of Covid.",在习近平的世界观中，党是中国传统等级制度和纪律的守护者，这些制度和纪律与民主国家的功能失调形成了对比。他认为，党的中央集权可以动员中国完成西方国家无法实现的壮举，比如减少农村贫困，迅速转向新技术，或者——有一段时间似乎是这样——有效地阻止新冠病毒的传播。
"""The superiority of our political system and system of governance is even more blazingly clear in its response to the Covid pandemic and winning the war on poverty,"" Mr. Xi said in March. ""The contrast between Chinese order and Western chaos has become even sharper.""","""我国政治制度和治理体系在应对新冠肺炎疫情、打赢脱贫攻坚战等实践中进一步彰显显著优越性，'中国之治'与'西方之乱'对比更加鲜明，""习近平在3月说。"
"Several months later, by the time Mr. Xi called together hundreds of officials to hear plans for the congress, the public mood in China had shifted markedly.",几个月后，当习近平召集数百名官员听取大会计划之际，中国的公众情绪已经发生了明显的转变。
"The government's severe measures against incessant outbreaks have fed rising frustration. China's economy has been caught in a painful slowdown, brought on by the pandemic restrictions and by steps to rein in big tech firms and debt-heavy developers. And Mr. Xi's fellow strongman, Vladimir V. Putin, has been mired in the floundering Ukraine invasion, forcing Beijing into diplomatic contortions.",政府对不断暴发的疫情采取的严厉措施，让人民的不满不断加剧。中国的经济已陷入痛苦的放缓，这是由疫情限制、控制大型科技公司和债台高筑的开发商所带来的。而与习近平同为强人领袖的普京一直深陷于入侵乌克兰的困境之中，迫使北京在外交上做出调整。
"Mr. Xi was unbowed. He told the assembled officials that China had to focus on steeling itself for an increasingly turbulent world. It was another instance of how he has turned a potential liability China's mood of embattled vulnerability into a foundation for hard-line policies, and an instrument to marshal obedience.",习近平没有被吓倒。他告诉与会的官员，中国必须专注于为一个日益动荡的世界做好准备。这又一次说明他如何将一个潜在的麻烦——中国陷入困境的脆弱情绪——转化为强硬政策的基础和争取服从的工具。
"""In the midst of struggle, we have been defending national dignity and core interests,"" Mr. Xi told the officials, shown vigorously applauding him.","""我们在斗争中维护国家尊严和核心利益，""习近平对官员们说，后者对他报以热烈掌声。"
"Mr. Xi rarely singles out the United States by name, but his warnings are clear enough. Rifts with the Trump and Biden administrations over technology sales, human rights and Taiwan appear to have hardened his distrust of Western intentions.",习近平很少点名美国，但他的警告足够明确。与特朗普和拜登政府在技术出售、人权和台湾问题上的分歧似乎使他对西方的意图更加不信任。
"President Biden's new national security strategy is likely to intensify Beijing's wariness. In it, Mr. Biden called China ""the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective.""","拜登总统的新国家安全战略可能会加剧北京的戒心。在该战略中，拜登称中国是""唯一一个既有重塑国际秩序的意图，又有越来越多的经济、外交、军事和技术力量来推进这一目标的国家""。"
"Mr. Xi has previously said that ""time and momentum"" are on China's side, and called the United States the ""biggest source of chaos in the present-day world.""","习近平此前曾表示，""时与势""在中国一边，并称美国是""当今世界最大的乱源""。"
"As the congress has neared, senior Chinese officials have garlanded Mr. Xi, the ""core"" leader, in vows of utter loyalty. ""Embrace the core with a sincere heart,"" said one. ""At all times and in all circumstances, trust the core, be loyal to the core, defend the core,"" said another.","大会临近之际，中国高级官员向""核心""领导人习近平表忠心，宣告自己的绝对忠诚。一人写道:""感情上衷心拥戴核心。""另一人写道:""任何时候任何情况下都信赖核心、忠诚核心、维护核心。"""
But Mr. Xi will need more than loyalty oaths to achieve his goals. His ambitions to build China into a technological titan are bringing to the fore a new breed of Chinese technocrats: scientists and engineers who have made their mark on projects like the space program.,但为了实现目标，习近平需要的不仅仅是忠诚誓言。他将中国建设成为科技巨头的雄心，正在将新一代的中国技术官僚推向幕前:在太空计划等项目上取得成功的科学家和工程师。
"""We must demonstrate the clear superiority of our country's socialist system in being able to concentrate forces to achieve big feats,"" Mr. Xi said at a meeting on technological innovation last month.","习近平在上个月召开的一次科技创新会议上说:""我们要发挥我国社会主义制度能够集中力量办大事的显著优势。"""
"Mr. Xi's promotions into the Politburo the council of 25 top officials could include several officials emerging from the aeronautics and other cutting-edge sectors. Some already steer economic powerhouse provinces, including Zhang Qingwei in Hunan, and Yuan Jiajun, the secretary of Zhejiang, who directed China's Shenzhou manned spaceflight program.",政治局由25名高级官员组成，有可能被习近平提拔进入政治局的人包括几名来自航空和其他前沿领域的官员。其中一些人已在掌舵经济强省，包括湖南的张庆伟和指挥中国神舟载人航天计划的浙江省委书记袁家军。
"""Given the challenges of the Chinese economy and a less hospitable external environment, technocrat leaders will likely be leaned on even more,"" said Damien Ma, managing director of MacroPolo, an institute that studies China.","""鉴于中国经济面临的挑战和不太友好的外部环境，可能会更倾向于技术官僚领导人，""研究中国的机构麦克罗波洛智库的执行董事马旸说。"
"None of the rising officials appears positioned to soon emerge as Mr. Xi's heir apparent. There are no formal limits on how long he may rule, and his hold on power may weaken only if China suffers a profound crisis.",这些即将升迁的官员似乎都不会很快成为习近平的接班人。他的统治时间没有正式限制，只有当中国遭受严重危机时，他对权力的控制才会减弱。
"Mr. Wu, the analyst in Beijing, likened Mr. Xi's predominance to ""garbage time"" in a basketball game: when the score is so lopsided that changes in the team in the final stretch make little difference.","北京的分析人士吴强将习近平的主导地位比作篮球比赛中的""垃圾时间"":当比分差距太大时，球队在最后阶段的换人几乎不会产生什么改变。"
"""Other players may leave the court, and others may go on and even score a beautiful three-pointer, and everyone will cheer,"" he said. ""But it won't affect the outcome.""","""一些球员可能会离场，另一些可能会继续比赛，甚至投进漂亮的三分球，大家会欢呼，""他说。""但不会影响结果。"""
"China's internet censors are going to great lengths to shut down any discussion of a rare public protest condemning Xi Jinping as a ""despotic traitor"" and denouncing the country's Covid-19 policies just days before the start of an all-important Communist Party congress.","就在至关重要的二十大召开之前数日，一场罕见的公开抗议谴责习近平是""独裁国贼""并批评中国新冠防疫政策。中国的网络审查正在不遗余力地清除任何相关讨论。"
"When a column of smoke appeared on Thursday over the Sitong Bridge overpass in the Haidian district of Beijing, it drew attention to a protester who had hung banners openly bashing China's top leader by name and criticizing the country's ""zero Covid"" policy, including one calling for ""freedom and not lockdowns.""","周四，当一股浓烟出现在北京海淀区四通桥的天桥上时，立刻吸引人们关注到了一名抗议者，他挂出的横幅直接点名抨击中国最高领导人，并且批评了中国的""清零""政策，其中一条呼吁""不要封锁要自由""。"
"The public act of defiance attracted huge attention on social media, with users sharing videos and photos of the protest. The posts were also quickly removed, but it set off a digital cat-and-mouse game, with some users indirectly alluding to the events in coded messages before the censors could catch on.",这一公开违抗之举在社交媒体上引发大量关注，人们纷纷转发这场抗议的视频和图片。相关帖子迅速遭到删除，但开启了一场猫捉老鼠的游戏，在审查还没反应过来之前，一些用户以暗语间接暗指这场抗议。
"Chinese censors have restricted searches about the episode on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, blocking certain hashtags, including ""Beijing,"" ""Sitong Bridge"" and ""Haidian."" Other seemingly related terms that appeared to be blocked from searches on the social media platform were ""courage,"" ""Beijing banner"" and ""warrior.""","中国审查人员已经限制了微博上关于该事件的搜索词条，屏蔽了一些包括""北京""、""四通桥""和""海淀""等词的特定标签。微博还屏蔽了其他看起来有相关性的搜索词条:""勇敢""、""北京横幅""和""勇士""。"
"China is already on high alert ahead of the party congress, which occurs every five years and starts on Sunday. At the meeting, Mr. Xi is expected to coast to a third term as leader.",中共党代会将于周日召开，目前中国已经处于高度戒备状态，党代会每五年举行一次。在本届会议上，习近平预计将获得第三个领导人任期。
"Eight marked police cars were parked under and around the bridge on Friday, and crowds of plainclothes officers in black sweatpants stood watch on the street corners.",周五，八辆有标志的警车停在四通桥下和周围，一群穿着黑色运动裤的便衣警察在街角站岗。
"When reporters began taking photos of the bridge, four plainclothes officers immediately ran over and ordered them to delete the photos. They said taking photos there was prohibited because of ""special circumstances.""","当记者开始拍摄四通桥的照片时，四名便衣警察立即跑过来，命令他们删除照片。便衣说，由于""特殊情况""，在那里拍照是被禁止的。"
The censoring also extended beyond search terms on social media with a connection to the incident.,审查的范围已经不局限于社交媒体上与该事件有关的搜索关键词。
"Some WeChat users said their accounts were frozen after they shared images of the bridge or sent text messages about the episode. This prompted some people to flood to the customer service community page of Tencent, WeChat's parent company, on Weibo, begging that their accounts be returned. One desperate user wrote about feeling ""deeply ashamed"" and expressed regret about comments written about the incident in a message group with four people.","一些微信用户说，在分享了四通桥的图片或发送了有关这一事件的文字讯息后，他们的帐户被冻结。这促使一些人涌向微信母公司腾讯公司在微博上的客服超话，乞求归还他们的帐户。一位绝望的用户写道，他感到""深深的羞愧""，并对在一个有四个人的微信群中发表关于该事件的评论表示后悔。"
The Tencent customer service community page on Weibo has been removed.,微博的腾讯人工客服超话已经被删除。
"In addition, a song called ""Sitong Bridge,"" a soft-rock tune by the band Mr. Graceless was removed from Chinese music apps. It also appeared to be removed from Apple Music for Chinese users.","此外，""不优雅""乐队的一首名为《四通桥》的轻摇滚歌曲在多个中国音乐应用程序上被删除。苹果音乐的中国区用户似乎也无法在该应用上找到这首歌。"
"On the comments section in some Chinese music apps of another song, ""Warrior of the Darkness"" by Eason Chan, a Hong Kong singer, some people posted remarks paying tribute to the protester. Those comments were removed.",在一些中国音乐应用上，一些人在香港歌手陈奕迅的歌曲《孤勇者》的评论区里发表了向抗议者致敬的言论。这些评论被删除。
"As a stubborn strain of Covid-19 rippled through China earlier this year and forced hundreds of millions of people into lockdown, officials turned to a new tool: regular mass P.C.R. testing. By testing every citizen several times a week, the authorities hoped to isolate cases more quickly and avoid future crippling lockdowns.",自从一种难以清除的新冠病毒变异株于今年早些时候开始在中国蔓延，迫使上亿人接受封控管理以来，官员们就求助于一个新工具:大规模常态化核酸检测。当局曾希望，通过要求每名公民每周做几次检测，就能更快地找到感染者，从而避免进行造成严重损害的封控。
"But in recent months that approach has failed to slow some of China's biggest outbreaks. Now, with the politically important Communist Party congress just days away, the mass testing program that has become the cornerstone of China's ""zero-Covid"" strategy appears to be foundering, even as it remains a fixture of the country's urban landscape and balloons into a multibillion dollar business.","但近几个月来，这种做法并未减缓中国一些最大的疫情反弹。现在，具有重大政治意义的中共二十大将在几天后召开，已成为中国新冠""清零""战略基石的大规模核酸检测看来正在失败，尽管中国城市里的核酸检测不仅没有消失的迹象，反而膨胀为价值数十亿美元的产业。"
"Desperate to isolate recent outbreaks, health workers have resorted to barricading buildings and even cordoning off single individuals in public spaces. Nearly two hundred million people are in some form of lockdown in China. In every village, town and city, testing requirements have become more burdensome and the punishment for failing to comply more severe.",迫不及待地想把最近暴发的疫情限制在当地的防疫人员已诉诸于对建筑物进行封锁，甚至在公共场所设立个人隔离点的做法。中国目前有近二亿人处于某种形式的封控下。在每个村庄、乡镇和城市，检测要求都已变得更加难以承受，对不遵守规定的惩罚也更加严厉。
"Yet with the testing apparatus growing bigger and bigger, the resources to support it have come under more financial strain, and the government, which funds most of the testing, has shown signs that it is struggling to pay up.",然而，随着核酸检测的规模越来越大，所需资金面临日益增长的财务压力，大部分检测资金来自政府财政，有迹象显示，政府也拿不出钱了。
"The mass testing strategy in China which has yet to approve an mRNA vaccine began in May with an order for cities with more than 10 million people to do regular testing and provide testing facilities within a 15-minute walk of anywhere in the city. Overnight, tens of thousands of testing booths popped up in cities like Shanghai and Beijing.",中国尚未批准采用mRNA技术的疫苗，在国内进行大规模检测的做法始于今年5月，政府下令在千万级人口城市实施常态化核酸检测，建立步行15分钟核酸采样圈。一夜之间，上万个检测点在上海和北京等城市出现。
"Blythe Dai said she gets tested for the coronavirus as frequently as possible. Her grandmother was recently dying in the hospital, but Ms. Dai wasn't allowed to see her because her 48-hour negative P.C.R. test had expired.",布莱斯·戴说，她尽可能频繁地做核酸检测。她的祖母最近生病住院快过世了，但医院不允许戴女士去看祖母，因为戴女士48小时前的核酸阴性结果已过期。
"""Covid is not so scary,"" said Ms. Dai, a 30-year-old resident in Shanghai. Instead, she said, it is the emotional cost that she and others have to pay. ""We have sacrificed too much to control the epidemic,"" she said.","""新冠就是没这么可怕，""现年30岁的上海居民戴女士说。可怕的是，她和其他人必须为其付出的情感代价，她说。""为了防疫已经牺牲太多了。"""
"For smaller local governments already under pressure to stimulate a slowing economy, building a testing network as large of those found in Shanghai and Beijing has created a huge financial strain.",对于本已面临压力，需要为放缓的经济提供刺激的小地方政府来说，设立像上海和北京那种规模的检测网给它们造成了巨大的财务压力。
"Local authorities in provinces such as Shanxi and Jiangxi have already diverted money from public projects in order to fund pandemic monitoring and control. In some cities, civil servants have faced pay cuts. In others, bonuses for officials have been frozen to help prop up testing.",为给新冠疫情监测和控制提供资金，山西和江西等省的地方政府已在挪用其他公共项目资金。有些城市的公务员面临减薪。还有些城市，官员的奖金被冻结，以便政府能继续支撑检测开销。
"And yet, there are signs from some of China's biggest testing companies that there is a cash shortfall.",尽管如此，中国几家最大核酸检测公司有迹象表明，它们存在现金短缺的问题。
"Dian Diagnostics said this summer that the amount of money it was still owed in payments had nearly doubled over the past year and warned of the ""risk of bad debts."" Shanghai Runda Medical Technology recently said that unpaid bills had increased by a quarter over the same period. Guangzhou Kingmed Diagnostics, warned that delays in payments could raise its risk profile.","迪安诊断在今年夏天表示，上半年的公司应收账款比去年同期几乎翻了一番，并警告，这种增长""带来了坏账风险""。上海润达医疗最近表示，今年的未付账单比去年同期增加了25%。广州金域医学警告，检测费用的结算推迟，增加了公司的风险预测。"
"""There is a serious imbalance between local government revenue and expenditure,"" analysts at the Bank of China Research Institute wrote in a note to clients in late September. They estimated that regular mass testing would cost nearly $100 billion a year if 900 million people were tested every three days.","""地方财政收支矛盾突出，""中国银行研究院的分析师在9月底发给客户的简报中写道。据他们估计，如果每三天对9亿人做一次核酸检测的话，检测费用将接近每年1000亿美元。"
"Cases have continued to rise as these financial pressures mount. Last week, a top official in the northeastern Xinjiang region, Liu Sushe, made a rare admission of defeat when he said, ""We have not been able to achieve dynamic zero Covid for more than two months,"" citing the ""ineffectiveness of our control measures.""","随着财政压力的增长，新冠感染病例也在继续增加。上周，新疆地区高级官员刘苏社罕见地承认了失败，他说，""持续两个月仍未实现'动态清零'目标""，原因是""防控工作中的问题和短板""。"
"While the testing measures are proving to be less effective, the industry continues to make huge profits. Bigger companies like Dian Diagnostics have reported revenues that more than doubled over the first 6 months of this year, said Jialin Zhang, head of China health care research at the Japanese bank Nomura.",虽然核酸检测被证明不太有效，但该行业仍在赚取巨额利润。日本野村证券的中国医疗保健研究主管张佳林说，据迪安诊断等规模较大公司的财报，今年上半年的营收增长了一倍多。
"For Chinese citizens like Chen Yaya, these riches have come to symbolize the futility of Beijing's zero-Covid policy.",在陈娅娅(音)这样的中国公民眼里，检测公司的财富已经成为北京新冠清零政策徒劳的象征。
"Ms. Chen, a Shanghai resident, said she is quietly protesting the city's testing requirements by refusing to get swabbed more than once a week, as required. She organizes her schedule so that she does her grocery shopping and sees friends within the first 72 hours after her weekly test. By limiting the number of tests she gets, she's hoping to avoid lining the pockets of testing companies and her chances of getting swept into a lockdown.",陈女士家住上海，她说她正在默默地抵制该市的病毒检测要求，每周只接受不超过一次的检测。她把去超市购物、与朋友见面的时间都安排在每周接受病毒检测后的72小时内。她想通过减少病毒检测的次数，让检测公司少发财，同时降低自己被隔离的可能性。
"""Reducing the profits of testing companies is only a superficial reason"" to avoid testing, Ms. Chen said. She is mostly concerned that she will be caught in a lockdown or sent to an government isolation facility if she tests positive. ""That's why I try to do as little as possible.""","""限制核酸企业利润，只是浅层的理由，""陈女士说。她最担心的是，如果她的检测结果呈阳性，她将被封在家中、或被送往政府的集中隔离设施。""我尽量少做，就是为此。"""
"To force people to submit to the swab, the authorities have reached for more punitive measures. In the south, north and east of China, police have detained people for days for skipping P.C.R. tests, sometimes locking them up for more than a week.",为了迫使人们接受核酸检测，当局采取了更多惩罚措施。在中国的南部、北部和东部都发生了警方将躲避病毒检测的人拘留数日的情况，有时，拘留时间甚至超过一周。
"There was a time when China's ability to find and isolate cases was considered the crown jewel of its pandemic strategy. While countries around the world saw infections soar and hospitals reach capacity, China's Covid numbers remained low, allowing officials in Beijing to relish in their success handling the virus while Chinese consumers kept the economy humming.",有段时间，中国找到和隔离感染病例的能力曾被认为是该国抗击新冠大流行策略的法宝。在世界各地的感染人数飙升、医院不堪重负的时候，中国感染新冠的人数曾一直保持在低位，让政府官员得以炫耀他们在应对疫情上的成功，同时不影响中国消费者继续为经济增长做贡献。
"But the new, near-daily testing regime meant to combat stubborn variants is being met with growing frustration as the true costs of sustaining such a program become more clear. For gig workers who only get paid by the order, for example, waiting in line for a test could mean lost wages.",然而，随着维持这样一个项目的真实成本变得越来越清晰，旨在打击顽固变异株而采取的几乎每天检测的新做法正让人们变得越来越沮丧。例如，对于只按订单拿工资的打零工者来说，排队做检测的时间可能意味着少挣钱。
"For people like Haily Zhao, who gets swabbed every 72 hours as required by the authorities in Beijing, testing cuts into the time she needs to decompress after work. ""It's not, 'I can do whatever I want as long as I'm doing P.C.R. testing,'"" said Ms. Zhao, 26. ""It's, 'Whatever I'm doing or want to do, I have to do a P.C.R. test first.""","赵海丽(音)按照北京当局的要求，每72小时做一次核酸检测，对向她这样的人来说，检测侵占了她下班后舒缓压力所需的时间。""并不是'我只要乖乖做核酸就可以想干啥就干啥了'，""现年26岁的赵女士说。""而是'不管你在干啥或者是想干啥，都得做核酸。'"""
"When one conference recently used the tagline ""The age of P.C.R. prosperity"" in its marketing material, the backlash was so swift that the organizers had to cancel the event and later clarified it was not meant to promote P.C.R. testing. ""Some people are rubbing salt in the wounds of those who are suffering,"" one commenter wrote of the conference online.","最近一个会议在宣传材料中用了""核酸盛世""的说法后，人们的反弹如此迅速，以至于组织者不得不取消了会议，后来还澄清，会议不是为了推销核酸检测。""有人在万民苦困的伤口上撒盐，""一名网友在网上这样评论该会。"
"Even some of the workers who swab throats and noses and process test results have lost enthusiasm for the country's testing protocols. Before China's mass testing mandate, there were 153,000 people employed as testers and hundreds of thousands of Communist Party member volunteers ready to help fight the coronavirus.",甚至一些从事采集咽拭子、鼻拭子工作，处理检测结果的人，也对国内的大规模检测失去了热情。中国在实行大规模检测之前，曾有15.3万名从事检测的雇员，以及随时准备为抗疫做贡献的几十万名党员志愿者。
"But the job is tiring and pays little. While a lab technician can make as much as $4,250 a month, advertisements for swabbing jobs offer something closer to $1,000.",但这个工作很累，工资也很低。一名实验室技术员的月薪可高达3万元，而拭子采集员招聘广告上给的工资不到每月7000元。
"""It's a boring, tedious, repetitive, mechanical job,"" said Hu Shixin, a college student in the eastern city of Nanjing. Mr. Hu volunteered for two weeks in August to help with testing in the industrial city of Taiyuan as part of a youth Communist Party program. Dressed in a sweaty protective suit, he scanned ID cards and handed out the P.C.R. testing tubes.","""这是一个无聊、枯燥、重复、机械的工作，""华东城市南京的大学生胡士新(音)说。今年8月，他参加了一个中共组织的青年项目，在工业城市太原当义工，协助当地的核酸检测工作。他干着扫描测试者身份证、给他们发核酸试管的工作，穿的防护服让他满身大汗。"
"Other community and medical workers sometimes cut corners and pretended to test people without taking samples, Mr. Hu said. ""Maybe they don't think that doing the P.C.R. test is so necessary,"" he added. ""For them, doing P.C.R. testing is just a job.""","胡先生说，有的社区人员和医务工作者有时会图省事，假装做检测，但不采集样本。""或许他们也不认为做核酸是多么必要的事情，是可以糊弄的，""他补充说。""他们做核酸检测员也只是为了完成一个工作。"""
"Across Tibetan villages in southwest China, Communist Party officials have been spreading the top leader Xi Jinping's gospel of national unity: that every ethnic group must fuse into one indivisible China with a shared heritage dating back over 5,000 years.",在中国西南部的藏族村庄里，共产党官员一直在传播最高领导人习近平的民族团结准则:所有民族必须融为一个不可分割的中国，拥有可追溯到5000多年前的共同遗产。
"Thousands of officials in Ganzi, a Tibetan region of Sichuan Province, have been paired with families to collect information and give out gifts of rice, cooking oil and beatific portraits of Mr. Xi all to hammer home his message of an encompassing Chinese identity, from Xinjiang in the west to the contested island of Taiwan in the east.",在四川省甘孜州的一个藏族地区，上万名公职人员与当地家庭结成对子，收集信息，并向各家赠送大米、食用油和习近平的画像等礼物——这一切都是为了强调他的信息，从西部的新疆到东部处于争夺中的台湾岛，都有一个全面的中国身份。
"""In the future I'll be a member of your family, too,"" Shen Yang, the Communist Party secretary of Ganzi, called Kardze in Tibetan, told one household, according to a local newspaper.","据当地报纸报道，甘孜州委书记沈阳对一户人家说，""今后我也是你们这个家庭中的一员了。"""
"The nationalist impulse behind this campaign is increasingly central to Mr. Xi's efforts to reshape China, with far-reaching consequences for education, social policy and politics. While appeals to the motherland have long been part of the party's tool kit, Mr. Xi has taken the imperative to new heights, calling for a unified ""community of Chinese nationhood"" as a bulwark against threats at home and abroad.","这场运动背后的民族主义动力对习近平重塑中国的努力越来越重要，对教育、社会政策和政治产生了深远影响。虽然对祖国的呼唤长期以来一直是该党工具箱的一部分，但习近平将其提升到新的高度，呼吁建立一个统一的""中华民族共同体""，作为抵御国内外威胁的堡垒。"
"As Mr. Xi prepares to claim a ground-breaking third term in power at a party congress starting on Sunday, he has in effect appointed himself China's historian in chief, crafting a story retold in museums, on television shows and in journals that casts his authoritarian, centralizing agenda as a fulfillment of values rooted in antiquity.",习近平正准备在周日的党代会上获得开创性的第三任期，他实际上已经任命自己为中国的首席历史学家，他精心策划了一个在博物馆、电视节目和期刊中重述的故事，将他的专制集权议程作为根植于古代的价值观的实现。
"In his vision, all Chinese people, regardless of ethnicity, are bound by cultural ties that reach back earlier than the first emperors. The implication is that anyone who defies Mr. Xi's priorities is also betraying China's ageless, sacred values.",在他的愿景中，无论哪个民族，所有中国人都被文化纽带联系在一起，这种文化纽带可以追溯到最早的几位帝王。言外之意是，任何违抗习近平优先事项的人也是在背叛中国神圣不朽的价值观。
"At a time when the United States, Russia, India and other countries have experienced their own resurgent nationalism, Mr. Xi's vision is also aimed at inoculating China against unwelcome influences, especially from the West. In May, Mr. Xi told the Politburo, the party's top 25 officials, that Westerners often wrongly viewed China as just a modern nation-state.",在美国、俄罗斯、印度和其他国家经历自己的民族主义复苏时，习近平的愿景也是为了让中国避免不利的影响，特别是来自西方的影响。5月，习近平对政治局(其成员为该党的25名最高官员)发表讲话称，西方人往往错误地认为，中国只是一个现代民族国家。
"""They don't view China from the vantage point of over 5,000 years of civilization,"" he said, using an often-used but disputed dating of its origins, ""so it's hard for them to truly understand China's past, present and future.""","""西方很多人习惯于把中国看作西方现代化理论视野中的近现代民族国家，没有从5000多年文明史的角度来看中国，""他说，5000年是一个经常使用但有争议的起源纪年，""这样就难以真正理解中国的过去、现在、未来。"""
"At its extreme, Mr. Xi's insistence on a singular Chinese identity has led to charges of cultural genocide from scholars and foreign countries, citing the mass detention of Uyghurs and other largely Muslim groups in Xinjiang.",在极端情况下，习近平对单一中国身份的坚持导致了学者和外国指控中国进行文化种族灭绝，理由是新疆的维吾尔人和其他主要穆斯林群体被大规模拘留。
"Other indoctrination efforts are underway among Tibetans, Mongolians and Hui Muslims. Mr. Xi's message is also aimed at Hong Kong and at Taiwan, the island that has grown increasingly averse to Beijing's demands for unification. ""Cultural identity is the deepest kind of identity,"" he has told officials.","其他灌输工作正在西藏、蒙古和回族穆斯林中进行。习近平的信息也针对香港和台湾，后者对北京的统一要求越来越反感。""文化认同是最深层次的认同，""他对官员们说。"
"A decade ago, Ganzi was a center of protests by Tibetans who set fire to themselves, sometimes fatally, to denounce Chinese rule. The new campaign appears intended to eradicate any remnants of potential resistance.",十年前，甘孜是西藏人的抗议中心，为谴责中国的统治，抗议者进行自焚，有时甚至失去生命。新的运动似乎旨在根除任何残余的潜在抵抗。
"The campaign is ""about encouraging the family to think of ways of changing traditional thinking while retaining local cultural features,"" Wuji Tsering, a Tibetan hostel operator visited by officials in the campaign, said by telephone.","该活动是为了""鼓励他们一家要在保留地方文化特色的基础上，多想办法、转变传统观念""，参加活动的官员拜访的藏族招待所经营者伍吉泽仁在接受电话采访时说。"
'The key is unity',"""关键是团结"""
"The relics, dug up in southwestern Sichuan Province, looked utterly unlike anything previously found in China. Enormous sculptures of heads with bulging, tube-shaped eyes. Gold masks with elfin ears. A 13-foot bronze tree, seemingly an object of worship.",这些出土于四川省西南部的文物，看起来与中国之前发现的任何东西都完全不同。巨大的头颅雕塑，突出的管状眼睛。长着尖耳朵的金面具。一棵四米高的青铜树，看起来像是崇拜物。
"One of China's most spectacular archaeological finds, the Sanxingdui site has been excavated since the 1980s, but has attracted a new burst of attention in the past two years, after the discovery of 13,000 more artifacts. Many who see it ask the same question: What do these unearthly looking objects have to do with China?",三星堆遗址是中国最壮观的考古发现之一，自上世纪80年代以来一直在发掘，过去两年里又发现了1.3万件文物，引起了新的关注。许多看过它的人都会问同一个问题:这些看起来不像来自地球的东西和中国有什么关系?
"""I think Sanxingdui might have come from aliens,"" said Han Zhongbao, a tourist visiting a museum dedicated to the site. ""I feel like Sanxingdui doesn't have any connection with Chinese culture.""","""我觉得三星堆可能是来自外星人的，""参观三星堆博物馆的游客韩中宝说。""我感觉三星堆的文化跟中国文化没什么联系。"""
"The Chinese authorities have emphatically argued the contrary. The government has promoted the more than 3,000-year-old relics as proof that early Chinese civilization was more diverse than many previously assumed, yet fundamentally cohesive.",中国当局则极力反驳。政府宣传称，这些有3000多年历史的文物证明，早期的中国文明比许多人之前认为的更加多样化，但从根本上来说是有凝聚力的。
"""In 'diversity in unity,' the key is unity,"" Sun Qingwei, an archaeologist at Peking University, told Xinhua, the state news agency. ""Sanxingdui civilization is one chapter in the formation of Chinese civilization, and it contains many cultural factors, but in the end it is integrated into Chinese civilization.""","""多元一体关键在一体，""北京大学考古学家孙庆伟对通讯社新华社表示。""三星堆文明是中华文明形成过程中的一个篇章，它本身也包含了多种文化因素，但最后融入到中华文明中来。"""
Experts point to similarities between the materials and techniques used to fashion the Sanxingdui bronzes and those used by kingdoms of central China traditionally regarded as a cradle of Chinese civilization.,专家指出，制作三星堆青铜器所用的材料和工艺与中原诸国的青铜器有相似之处，那些王国在传统上被视为中华文明的摇篮。
"""Through this very specific, practical scientific evidence, we want to recover these connections one by one,"" Li Haichao, an archaeology professor at Sichuan University who led some recent excavations, said in an interview. ""'Diversity in unity' is not just an empty slogan.""","""通过这种很具体、实际的科学证据，我们也想把这种联系一条条的给它复原起来，""最近领导了一些挖掘工作的四川大学考古学教授黎海超在一次采访中表示。""'多元一体'它不仅仅是一个空的口号。"""
But other archaeologists argue that the ancient settlements don't support China's modern claim to be a united state reaching back millenniums.,但其他考古学家认为，这样的古代聚落并不能支持中国几千年前就是统一国家的现代主张。
"""There was no idealized nation before,"" said Wang Ming-ke, a Taiwanese scholar of ancient China who has studied the Sanxingdui site. Stories of national origin in China and the world are constructed by the authorities to consolidate power, he added. ""And then they say, 'This is where our culture, our civilization, our ancestors came from.'""","""过去就没有过理想化的国家，""研究过三星堆遗址的台湾古中国学者王明珂说道。他还说，中国和世界的民族起源故事是当局为了巩固权力而编造的。""然后他们就说，'我们的文化、我们的文明、我们的祖先就来自这里。'"""
"To Mr. Xi, these questions are loaded with political implications. Before the meeting in May on the origins of Chinese civilization, he held a Politburo meeting in 2020 on ""archaeology with Chinese characteristics."" In 2017, he and President Donald J. Trump haggled over whether China or Egypt had the older civilization.","对于习近平而言，这些问题都饱含政治意蕴。在今年5月召开会议探讨中华文明的起源之前，他曾在2020年主持过关于""中国特色考古学""的中央政治局会议。2017年，他还与特朗普总统就中国与埃及哪国文明更古老的问题争论了一番。"
"""Only China has continued onward, unbroken as a culture,"" Mr. Xi told Mr. Trump as they strolled through Beijing's Forbidden City.","""文化没有断过流的，始终传承下来的，只有中国，""在北京故宫漫步时，习近平这样告诉特朗普。"
"The government has poured increased funding into historical and archaeological research. The support comes with pressure for researchers' findings to reflect the official narrative. Projects should ""reveal the formation and development of a diverse yet united Chinese civilization,"" says the government's five-year plan for archaeology.","政府对历史和考古研究增加了资金投入。随之而来的，还有研究人员的发现结果必须反映官方叙事的压力。政府在考古工作的五年规划中写明，考古项目应""揭示中华文明多元一体形成与发展过程""。"
"The goal is to excite the kind of pride that Nie Yuying, a 17-year-old high school student, felt as she visited the Sanxingdui museum.",此举的目的就是为了激发出像17岁高中生聂玉英(因)在参观三星堆博物馆时那样的自豪感。
"""They show the inheritance of Chinese culture,"" Ms. Nie said of the exhibits.","""它们展示了中华文化的传承，""聂玉英在谈到这些展品时说。"
"""We've been quite deeply influenced by Western culture and art,"" she added. ""For the sake of our future development and so we don't forget our own roots, we must study this nation's past.""","""我们深受西方文化和艺术的影响，""她补充道。""为了我们的未来发展，为了不忘记自己的根，我们必须学习这个国家的过去。"""
"The Chinese government's efforts go far beyond Sanxingdui. It insists that books and displays about Tibet, Xinjiang and borderlands present them as ageless parts of China. Officials argue that genetic and linguistic links between Tibetans and Han Chinese, the country's dominant ethnic group, show that even the mountains of Tibet were conjoined to Chinese civilization thousands of years ago.",中国政府所付出的努力远不止在三星堆。它严格要求关于西藏、新疆和边境地区的书籍展览都要将这些地方描绘成中国亘古不变的一部分。官员们辩称，藏族与中国的多数民族汉族之间有基因和语言联系，这说明了在数千年前，即使是西藏的山脉也与中华文明息息相关。
"""The community of Chinese nationhood originally existed as a natural phenomenon, a natural essence, and only then did we give it a name,"" Li Hui, a genetics professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in a recent lecture. ""There was first the community and only then each ethnic group.""","""中华民族共同体它是原来就存在这个自然现象，自然本质，我们再给它一个名称，""上海复旦大学遗传学教授李辉在最近一次演讲中说道。""我们先有一个共同体，然后才有各个民族。"""
'Strangers in their own home',"""自家的陌生人"""
Gyal Lo grew increasingly worried as this muscular vision of Chinese nationhood reached the remote towns and villages he regularly visited.,当这种关于中华民族地位的强势愿景已经影响到他经常前往的偏远城镇和村庄时，嘉洛(音)变得愈发担忧。
"A Tibetan professor of education, he had traversed western China for decades, encouraging Tibetan administrators, teachers and families there to keep schooling alive in their native language and culture. His efforts, never easy, became increasingly fraught in recent years as schools moved to almost exclusively Chinese-language classes.",作为一名教育专业的藏族教授，他数十年来一直游历中国西部，鼓励那里的藏族行政人员、教师和家庭以他们自己的母语和文化继续教书育人。他的努力从来都不是一件易事，随着近年来学校几乎全都改上汉语课程，他的工作遇到了越来越多的挫折。
"""A language is not just the grammar,"" he said in an interview. ""It carries our culture.""","""语言不仅仅是语法，""他在一次采访中表示。""它承载了我们的文化。"""
"Mr. Xi has sharply accelerated a drive to instill Chinese language and culture in ethnic minorities, most extensively in Xinjiang, but also among ethnic Tibetans and Mongolians.",习近平大大加快了向少数民族灌输中国语言和文化的步伐，对新疆最为无孔不入，但对藏族和蒙古族也是如此。
"Officials in Inner Mongolia, a region of northern China, detained parents who protested against the shift to an all-Chinese curriculum in 2020. Last year, the Chinese Ministry of Education issued orders that preschool for all children from ethnic minorities be in Mandarin.",2020年，位于中国北部内蒙古的官员拘捕了抗议学校改授全中文课程的家长。去年，中国教育部还颁发命令，要求所有少数民族儿童的学前教育必须使用普通话。
"""For a long time our country's ethnic work gave too much emphasis to ethnic minorities' particularity, traditional culture and right to self-government,"" Ma Rong, a sociologist at Peking University who has long championed stronger efforts to integrate minorities, wrote in July in Global Times, a state-owned newspaper.","""我国民族工作长期偏重维护少数民族特殊性、传统文化和自治权利，""7月，倡导加强少数民族融合已久的北京大学社会学家马戎在官媒《环球时报》刊文称。"
"Mr. Xi's government has been promoting officials who support that viewpoint. This year, it appointed Pan Yue to lead China's National Ethnic Affairs Commission. From the 1950s until 2020, the commission was always led by an official from an ethnic minority. But Mr. Pan and his immediate predecessor are both Han, and Mr. Pan has energetically taken up the idea of a shared identity rooted in the ancient past.",习近平政府一直在提拔支持这种观点的官员。今年，潘岳被任命为国家民族事务委员会主任。从上世纪50年代到2020年，该委员会一直由少数民族官员领导。但潘岳及其前任都是汉族，而潘岳也非常乐于接受根植于古代的共同身份观念。
"""Chinese civilization has never been interrupted, and its foundation lies in a great unity,"" Mr. Pan said in a speech last year. ""Historically, China has not lacked a diversity of ethnic groups and religions, but no matter how diverse these groups, they must through their shared fates always merge into one.""","""中华文明从未中断，根子在大一统，""潘岳在去年的一次讲话中表示。""历史上，中国不乏多元族群与多元宗教。但无论族群如何多元，总能因命运与共而融为一体。"""
"The Tibetan educator, Mr. Gyal Lo, 55, began his efforts over two decades ago, when the Chinese government was more relaxed about ethnic policy, and schools in Tibetan regions often taught children in their own local language.",现年55岁的藏族教育家嘉洛早在20多年前就开始了他的努力，当时中国政府的民族政策较为宽松，藏区学校经常以自己的本土语言给孩子上课。
Mr. Gyal Lo said he hoped that Tibetan children could first learn their local language Tibetan is actually a wide family of dialects and then begin to master standard writing and speech.,嘉洛说，他希望藏族孩子可以先学地方语言——藏语实际上是一个由多种方言组成的大家庭——然后再去掌握标准语言的写与说。
"Under Mr. Xi, the space for local languages shrank and shrank. Schools increasingly demanded that pupils be educated almost exclusively in Chinese. Since 2016, growing numbers of Tibetan children, as young as 4 or 5, have been sent to boarding schools to accelerate their Chinese language immersion, Mr. Gyal Lo said. He saw the effects when children returned home for the weekend.",在习近平治下，留给地方语言的空间越来越逼仄。学校愈发严格地要求学生基本只接受中文教育。嘉洛表示，自2016年以来，越来越多年仅四五岁的藏族儿童被送往寄宿学校，以加速接受中文浸淫。当孩子们在周末返回家中，他看到了这样做的效果。
"""It felt like they became strangers, guests, in their own home,"" Mr. Gyal Lo said. ""They stay away instead of engaging in the conversation and physically touching their parents.""","""感觉就像他们成了自己家中的陌生人、客人，""嘉洛说。""他们不参与谈话，也与父母没有肢体接触。"""
"Mr. Gyal Lo left China in late 2020, after his teaching contract at a university in Yunnan Province was terminated. He said he feared that his Tibetan ethnicity and educational activism made him a growing target of political suspicion. He now campaigns from Canada, where he previously studied, to end China's compulsory boarding schools for Tibetan children.",在云南省一所大学的教学合同被终止后，嘉洛于2020年底离开了中国。他说，担心藏族身份和教育行动主义会让自己遭受越来越多的政治怀疑。如今，他在加拿大这个他曾经的求学之地发起运动，希望能结束中国对藏族儿童上寄宿学校的强制。
"""For a little while we had a little bit of space to do our own approach,"" he said. ""Now we can speak of school education in Tibet, but we can no longer say there is Tibetan education.""","""有一段时间，我们还得到了用自己的方法做事的一点空间，""他说。""现在我们可以谈论西藏的学校教育，但已经不能说还存在藏族教育了。"""
Honoring the Yellow Emperor,祭祀黄帝
"In a narrow, lush valley in eastern Zhejiang Province, hundreds of officials and their guests gathered this month for a ceremony to honor the Yellow Emperor.",本月，在浙江省东部的一处郁郁葱葱的狭窄山谷里，数百名官员及其宾客汇聚一堂，参加了一场祭祀黄帝的典礼。
"Horns and a drum sounded. Soldiers laid baskets of flowers for the emperor, a mythical deity-king known as the forefather of the Han people. Dozens of performers in flowing robes sang and danced. A giant dragon was released into the sky.",号角和鼓声奏响。军人们为这位汉人的祖先、神话中的神祇帝王献上花篮。数十名穿着飘逸长袍的表演者载歌载舞。一条巨龙被放飞到空中。
"""How great our ancestor, who laid the foundation for 5,000 years of Chinese culture,"" the local mayor, Wu Shunze, intoned. He included a dedication to Mr. Xi.","""伟哉吾祖，为五千年华夏人文开基立业，""当地的市长吴舜泽叹道。他还有写给习近平的献词。"
"Nation-building spectacles like this one grandiose, often far-fetched recreations of ancient rituals have grown larger, more elaborate and more prominent across China.",这样的民族塑造奇观浮夸又牵强地复刻了古代仪式，在中国各地的规模都愈发宏大、复杂和引人注目。
"Mr. Xi's nationhood drive is also aimed at building unity among China's Han people, who make up 91 percent of its population. Officials see state-managed nationalism organized, scripted, contained as a tool to channel public sentiment and maintain a united front in the face of growing hostility, especially from Washington and its allies.",习近平的民族运动还旨在建立占中国总人口91%的汉族的团结。官员们将由国家管理的民族主义——即有组织、照本宣科、程度可控——视为一种工具，用来引导公众情绪，并在面对(尤其是来自美国及其盟友)日益增长的敌意时保持统一战线。
"It is the driving force behind Mr. Xi's attempt to fold Taiwan into China. At his Yellow Emperor ceremony, Mr. Wu promised that unification with Taiwan was ""unstoppable.""","这是习近平意欲将台湾并入中国的驱动力。在黄帝祭祀大典上，吴舜泽承诺与台湾的统一""势不可挡""。"
"""In this view, the party is the arbiter of all Chineseness,"" said Geremie R. Barme, a Sinologist in New Zealand.","""按照这样的观点，何为中国的，将由党来定夺，""新西兰的汉学家白杰明(Geremie R. Barmé)表示。"
"A risk is that the government can lose control of nationalism, even as it encourages the emotion. This summer, Chinese social media users dismayed that Beijing did not forcibly stop the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, from visiting Taiwan erupted in anger. They complained that the government's swaggering rhetoric had misled them to expect military action, and mocked the Chinese Army as weak.",一个风险在于，政府可能会让民族主义失控，哪怕它鼓励了这种情绪。今年夏天，出于对北京未能强行阻止众议院议长南希·佩洛西访问台湾的失望，中国社交媒体用户怒火中烧。他们抱怨说，政府的夸夸其谈让他们误以为会采取军事行动，并嘲笑中国军队软弱无能。
"Beijing raced to bring the ire back within its preferred contours. After Ms. Pelosi's visit, it issued a policy paper emphasizing bloodlines and cultural ties to restate its view that Taiwan had always been part of China. China's foreign minister said Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, had ""betrayed the ancestors."" Another official pointed to noodles served in Taipei as proof that Taiwan was China's ""long lost child.""","北京迅速把民愤控制在了其允许的范围内。在佩洛西访台后，北京发布了一份强调两岸血缘和文化联系的政策文件，重申了台湾始终属于中国的立场。中国外交部长将台湾总统蔡英文称为""不肖子孙""。另一位官员指出，在台北餐馆售卖的面条证明台湾是中国""失散多年的孩子""。"
"Yang Chen, a pharmaceutical company worker who helps organize an annual ritual honoring the Yellow Emperor near Zhengzhou, in central China, said that he hoped more people from Taiwan would take part in such rituals.",药企员工杨晨在中国中部的郑州附近帮助组织了一年一度的黄帝祭祀典礼，他希望更多台湾人能参加这样的仪式。
"""That's good to acknowledge that you're Chinese, to first find something in common in culture,"" he said before hesitating about whether such symbols could win over Taiwan. ""But then again, wasn't there that thing a while ago about Pelosi going there?""","""认可自己是中国人，这个还是挺好的，先从文化上先找一个共同的认可的东西，""他说，随后他开始犹豫这些象征符号能否赢得台湾的认同。""但是也不一定哈，前一段时间不是还发生了佩洛西去(台湾)的事吗?"""
"SHENZHEN, China The signs of a looming lockdown in Shenzhen, China, had been building for a while. The city had been logging a few coronavirus infections for days. Daily Covid tests were required to go pretty much anywhere. Individual buildings had been sealed off.",中国深圳——中国深圳即将封城的迹象已经有一段时间了。这座城市几天来一直都有新冠病毒新增病例。几乎去任何地方都需要每天的核酸检测结果。个别建筑物已经被封锁。
"So when a hotel employee woke me up a little after 7 a.m. to explain that we were not allowed to step outside for four days, my initial disorientation quickly turned to resignation.",所以，当一名酒店员工在早上7点刚过时将我叫醒，解释说我们四天不准出门时，我最初的迷茫很快变成了无奈。
Of course this happened. I live in China.,发生这种事是必然。我住在中国。
"As the rest of the world sheds more restrictions by the day, China's rules are becoming more entrenched, along with the patterns of pandemic life under a government insistent on eliminating cases. People schedule lunch breaks around completing mandatory tests. They restructure commutes to minimize the number of health checkpoints along the way.",世界其他地区日益放开，中国的抗疫规定却愈加不容更改，由于政府坚持将病例清零，疫情下的生活模式亦随之变得更加根深蒂固。人们依照完成强制性核酸检测的时间来计划自己的午休。他们重新制定通勤路线，以尽量减少路上被查健康码的次数。
"A sense of possible disaster always lurks, driven by the experiences of Shanghai and other cities, where sudden lockdowns have left residents without food or medicine. A friend bought a second freezer so she could stock up on groceries.",上海和其他城市曾突遭封城，导致民众缺食少药，这些城市的经历总让人有一种灾难可能随时发生的感觉。一个朋友给家里买了第二台冰箱，方便囤积食物。
"Yet the policies have been in place for so long, and with so little sign of easing, that navigating them feels if not normal at least routine. I know which testing site near my home returns results the quickest, and which grocer doesn't check whether you've logged your visit for future contact tracing.",但这些政策实施了这么久，而且几乎没有放松的迹象，以至于应对起来即使没到习以为常的程度，也至少给人例行公事的感觉。我知道我家附近哪个核酸检测点出结果最快，我还知道哪家超市在你进店时不检查你是否扫了场所码。
"The disruptive becomes typical; the once-unimaginable, reality. The pandemic has imposed new rituals around the world, but in China, the extremes make that process more unsettling.",扰动变得日常;曾经难以想象的事情成为现实。疫情给世界各地强加新的日常习惯，但中国的极端做法使这一过程更加令人不安。
"The most obviously jarring aspects, for me, were technological. China under ""zero Covid"" is a web of digital codes. At the entrance to every public space restaurants, apartment complexes, even public restrooms is a printed-out QR code that people must scan with their phones to log their visit. Everyone also has a personal health code, which uses test results and location history to assign a color. Green is good. Yellow or red, and you may be sent to quarantine.","对我来说，最突兀的莫过于技术方面的。""清零""政策下的中国是一个以数字代码组成的蛛网。在每个公共空间的入口处——餐厅、公寓大楼，甚至公共厕所——都有一个打印出来的二维码，人们必须用手机扫描二维码打卡。每个人还有一个健康码，依据核酸检测结果和行程历史显示颜色。绿码没事。黄码或红码就会被送去隔离。"
"What actually determines the color of your code, though, is nebulous. When a banking scandal prompted protests in Henan Province this year, officials manipulated protesters' health codes to block them from gathering. The morning in August that a colleague and I were scheduled to fly from the southern city of Guangzhou to Shanghai, her code suddenly, without explanation, turned yellow, meaning she could not board the plane. A health worker said the code would revert if she took another Covid test (never mind that we'd been taking daily tests for two weeks). It did barely an hour before takeoff.",然而，决定健康码颜色的因素模糊不清。今年，当一场银行丑闻在河南省引发抗议后，官员们改动了抗议者的健康码，以阻止他们聚集。8月的一个早上，我和一个同事原定从南方城市广州飞往上海，她的健康码突然毫无理由地变成了黄色，意味着她无法登机。一名防疫人员说，如果再做一次核酸检测，就能恢复绿码(即使我们已经连续两周每天都做了核酸)。确实恢复了——在起飞前不到一个小时的时候。
"Testing sites are ample, at least, since the government has ordered they be within a 15-minute walk in cities. And they are easily identified even from afar. They usually have a line, which can grow to be blocks long during lunchtime or after work. Many also have their own soundtrack: a prerecorded voice, ordering people to stand one meter apart, blaring through a megaphone on loop.",至少检测点足够多，这是因为政府下令要求城市建立步行15分钟核酸采样圈。而且这些检测点老远就能看见。通常排着队，在午休时间或下班后，队伍可能有一个街区那么长。许多检测点还有自制的背景音:扩音器里循环播放着预先录制的语音，命令人们间隔一米。
"On hot days, people wait sometimes for 30 minutes, face masks plastered to their skin by sweat. In the city of Chongqing this summer, residents lined up while wildfires raged nearby. The night I landed in Shanghai, officials had raised a typhoon warning, and ordered the skyline, including the iconic Pearl Tower, darkened in case of a power outage. I huddled with dozens of people in a testing line under umbrellas.",在炎热的天气里，人们有时会等上30分钟，汗水将口罩粘在皮肤上。今年夏天，重庆市的居民们排起了长队，而附近的山火正在肆虐。我在上海降落的那天晚上，官员们发布了台风警告，并下令暂停开放景观照明以防停电，包括标志性的东方明珠电视塔。我和几十个人打着伞，挤在一个检测点的队伍里。
"Some features of Covid-era China are testaments to human creativity. The Guangzhou Library offers book sterilizing machines, which look like high-tech refrigerators. Manufacturers of personal protective equipment have devised individual air conditioning units, which inflate medical workers' hazmat suits with cool air while they conduct hours of mass testing.",在新冠时代的中国，一些特有的事物证明了人类的创造力。广州图书馆提供书籍消毒机，它们看上去像一个高科技冰箱。个人防护设备制造商设计了空气压缩制冷防护服，在医务人员进行长时间大规模检测时，可以为他们的防护服充入冷气。
"My favorite invention is the ""temporary quarantine area,"" where anyone deemed a potential health risk while in public can be deposited until medical care arrives. Many of these areas seem more pro forma than designed to halt transmission. Some are tents in building lobbies. Some are corners with folding chairs. Near Beijing's biggest park, one is a roped-off section of open air.","我最中意的发明是""临时隔离区""，任何在公共场所被认为存在潜在健康风险的人都可以暂时留在那里，直到医护人员到达。许多这样的隔离区似乎不是为了阻止传播，而是为了形式上的存在。有的是在建筑物大厅撑起帐篷。有的是在角落里放几把折叠椅。在北京最大的公园附近，有一个用绳索圈出来的户外区域。"
"It is possible to avoid the endless testing by simply not going anywhere. In a part of Guangzhou dominated by warrens of small-scale textile factories, one worker told me he hadn't noticed the city's testing requirement to go outside the district. He and his friends rarely left it anyway, sleeping in dormitories close to the factories and lounging at a nearby lemon tea shop on their days off. Factory owners were supposed to check for up-to-date test results when hiring, but few did, he said.",想避开没完没了的核酸检测是有可能的——只要不去任何地方。在广州一片以小型纺织厂为主的地区，一名工人告诉我，他不知道城市对跨区出行的核酸检测要求。反正他和朋友们很少离开这里，他们睡在工厂附近的宿舍里，休息日则在附近的柠檬茶店闲坐。他说，工厂老板本该在招聘时查看最新的核酸结果，但很少有人这样做。
"The economic effects of the restrictions have been harder to ignore. He had been caught in several lockdowns, leaving him unable to work for weeks. Jobs were scarcer anyway, as fewer people were buying clothing. Lately, he'd been spending more time at the lemon tea shop.",限制措施的经济影响更难以忽视。他曾数次困于封锁，导致数周无法工作。毕竟工作机会越来越少，因为买衣服的人越来越少。最近，他待在柠檬茶店的时间越来越多。
"Signs of the slowdown are everywhere. Taxi drivers offer unprompted assessments of how thin traffic is. In the food court near my office in Beijing, many of the stalls have gone dark, leaving diners at the surviving shops to eat in a spooky half-glow.",到处都是经济衰退的迹象。出租车司机会主动感叹车流有多稀疏。在我北京办公室附近的美食广场，许多摊位都已关门，在幸存的店铺中，食客只能在阴森晦暗的环境中用餐。
"And the costs of zero Covid are not limited to lost jobs. When my hotel in Shenzhen locked down, the staff said we would have to pay for our extended stays ourselves.",新冠清零的代价不仅限于失业。当我在深圳住的酒店被封，工作人员说我们必须自付续住的费用。
"I managed to escape the lockdown early. As the afternoon wore on, my colleague and I, who had been traveling together, noticed people slipping out through a staff exit. Under repeated pestering, the reception staff conceded that we could leave, if we found somewhere willing to take us despite our travel history to a lockdown area. Within 20 minutes, we were on our way to the train station.",我设法提前逃离了封锁。随着下午慢慢过去，我和一起出行的同事发现有人从员工出口溜出去。经过反复纠缠，接待人员同意我们可以离开，只要有地方愿意接收我们，因为我们的行程包含了封控区。不到20分钟，我们就在去火车站的路上了。
"That is what's impossible to get used to: the utter arbitrariness. You're under lockdown, until someone decides you're not.",这是你不可能习以为常的生活:完全任人摆布。在有人决定放行之前，你将一直处于封锁状态。
"You can take all the required tests, and be perfectly healthy, but your health code can still turn yellow.",你大可做完所有必要的检测，而且即使你非常健康，你的健康码依然可能变黄。
"For many Chinese, the past few years of the pandemic have stirred the spectrum of emotions from anger to frustration to grief. But the first word many people reach for, when I ask how they feel, is helplessness.",对于许多中国人来说，从愤怒到沮丧再到悲伤，这几年的疫情引发了各种各样的情绪。但当我问及许多人的感受时，他们想到的第一个词是无助。
"""What's the point in getting myself upset?"" a single mother in Shenzhen, who had been locked down several times and worried about affording her son's tuition fees, said. It wouldn't change anything.","""让自己生气有什么意义呢?""深圳一位单身母亲说，曾遭遇多次封锁的她担心难以负担儿子的学费。生气改变不了任何事。"
"Others try to wrest back some sense of control, however small. A woman I met in Shanghai has given a house key to her neighbor, so someone can feed her cat if she gets snagged by a snap quarantine. People flash screenshots of old test results to inattentive security guards.",还有人则试图夺回一些控制感，不管这种控制有多么微不足道。我在上海遇到的一位女士把房子钥匙放在邻居那里，万一她突然被封控，还有人能帮她喂猫。还有人会把以前的检测结果截图迅速亮给漫不经心的保安。
"The Chinese internet is an endless reservoir of dark humor about the Covid rules, especially from people experiencing the harshest conditions. A user in Xinjiang recently posted a video captioned, ""They sent us instruments in quarantine,"" in which she banged a rock-hard biscuit against a table in time to an electronic beat. When residents in the city of Chengdu emptied grocery stores before a citywide lockdown, social media users made posters joking that officials had announced a Black Friday-type shopping holiday.","中国互联网上全是关于新冠防疫规定的黑色幽默，经历过最严酷措施的人发布的内容尤其如此。新疆一位用户最近发布了一段视频，标题是""他们给我们送来了隔离乐器""，在视频中，她拿着像石头一样硬的饼干配合电子节拍敲击桌子。当成都市居民在全市封锁前买空超市，社交媒体用户制作了海报，开玩笑说官方宣布了一个类似""黑色星期五""的购物假期。"
"I've been moved, and a little awed, by the ways people have found to plod through the pain. Still, I often think about a warning, or plea, written by a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University, against getting too used to this circumscribed form of life.",人们在痛苦中艰难前行的样子令我感动，甚至有些敬畏。但我还是总会想到北京名校清华大学的一位教授写下的警告，亦或者说是恳求，她希望人们不要太过习惯于这种受限制的生活方式。
"""Do not let the prolonged epidemic and the economic downturn make you give up your dreams or lower your expectations,"" the professor, Lao Dongyan, wrote in an essay shared widely on Chinese social media earlier this year before it was censored. ""We need to adjust and adapt to the external environment, but not by doing that.""","""不要因为疫情的久拖不决与经济的低迷下滑，就放弃自己的梦想，降低自我的期待，""劳东燕教授写道，今年年初这篇文章在中国社交媒体上广为流传，后来遭到审查。""我们需要做出调整，也需要适应外部环境，但不是通过放弃梦想与降低期待来实现。"""
"This week, when I went to the testing site outside my office for my regular swab, I noticed that the station, which had previously closed at 6:30 p.m., was now 24-hour. I was delighted until I considered what, exactly, I was celebrating.",本周，去办公室外的检测点进行常规拭子检测时，我发现之前到下午6点半就关门的站点如今变成了24小时开放。我很高兴——直到我开始思考自己到底在庆祝些什么。
"In China's far west region of Xinjiang, officials imposed a near-total lockdown and made a rare admission of failure in their handling of a Covid outbreak. In Inner Mongolia in the north, the authorities vowed ""all-out"" efforts to cut the spread of the virus. And in a popular travel destination in Yunnan, in China's south, the government canceled flights, trapping crowds of angry tourists at an airport.","在中国西部新疆地区，官员们采取了几乎全面的封控措施，并罕见地承认他们未能将新冠疫情控制住。在北部的内蒙古，当局保证要""全力""遏制新冠病毒的传播。在中国西南省份云南的一个热门旅游目的地，政府取消了航班，将愤怒的游客困在了机场。"
"China is facing its largest flare-up of Covid cases in a month, complicating its preparations for an all-important Communist Party meeting where Xi Jinping is expected to expand his authority and claim another term in power. Provincial and local officials have vowed to stop the spread of the coronavirus from ""spilling over"" to Beijing, the capital, where the meeting will be held.","中国新增感染数创下一个月来的新高，使国内为中共即将举行的一个重要会议的筹备工作变得复杂起来。在这次会议上，预计习近平将扩大他的权力，继续掌权。省级和地方官员作出保证，不让新冠病毒的传播""蔓延""到会议地点北京。"
"Daily Covid counts have more than doubled in the past week, to around 1,400 cases on Friday, in the country of 1.4 billion people a tally that remains tiny by global standards. But Chinese authorities are under immense pressure to ensure that nothing disrupts the party congress, which starts Oct. 16. They have responded by ramping up restrictions that many already deem excessive. They are locking down regions and cities and mandating mass testing and quarantines, disrupting life for millions of people and drawing public complaints.",过去一周，在这个拥有14亿人口的国家，日均新增感染病例增加了一倍多，周五达到了约1400例。以全球标准来衡量，这个数字仍属极低水平。但中国当局正面临着巨大压力，确保定于10月16日召开的中共二十大不会受到任何干扰。他们的应对措施是加强了许多人认为已经过分的限制。一些地区和城市采取了封控措施，并进行强制性的全员病毒检测和隔离，数百万人的生活被扰乱，民众怨声载道。
"The authorities are sticking closely to their ""zero Covid"" policy of eliminating infections, despite the enormous economic and social cost of the strategy. Mr. Xi has made ""zero Covid"" a political imperative, linking support for the policy to support for the Communist Party, as he looks to hail China's success in curbing infections as a sign of the superiority of Beijing's authoritarian system.","当局仍在坚持""清零""政策，尽管这样做已给经济和社会造成了巨大代价。随着习近平希望把遏制新冠病毒的成功作为中国威权体制优越性的标志，他将清零作为当前最重要的政治任务来抓，并且把支持清零政策与支持中共联系起来。"
"China's pandemic strategy is ""almost a political campaign to show loyalty to Xi Jinping himself,"" said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""This makes the local officials even more anxious because they all want to stay in the good graces of Xi Jinping.""","中国应对新冠疫情的战略""几乎是一场对习近平个人表忠诚的政治运动""，香港中文大学政治学兼职教授林和立说。""这让地方官员们更加焦虑，因为他们都想继续得到习近平的欢心。"""
"Covid infections have surged in part because of the country's weeklong National Day holiday, which started on Oct. 1. Despite the appeals of health officials for people to limit travel, many flocked to tourist hot spots. Now, they are stranded after flights and trains were canceled.",10月1日开始的为期一周的国庆假期在一定程度上导致了感染人数的激增。尽管卫生官员呼吁人们非必要不出行，许多人还是涌向了热门旅游景点。现在，由于航班和列车被取消，他们被困在外地。
"Lockdowns have been punishing for the residents of less-developed regions. Shortages of food and medicine have been common in those areas, prompting residents to take to social media with complaints and pleas for help.",对欠发达地区的居民来说，封控让生活变得更加艰难。食品和药品短缺在这些地区是常见现象，导致居民到社交媒体上抱怨和求助。
"The fast-spreading Omicron variant has constantly slipped through China's tight restrictions. Officials in Xinjiang were forced to admit that lapses in their approach led to cases spilling over from the region to other provinces and major cities, including Beijing.",快速传播的奥密克戎变异株一再突破中国的严格控制。新疆官员被迫承认他们在遏制传播上的失误导致了新冠病毒从该地区扩散到了其他省份和主要城市，包括北京。
"Liu Sushe, the vice chairman of the Xinjiang region, conceded this week that the area of 22 million people was facing its most difficult public health emergency ever. He said some officials had been lax in their work, failing to properly impose measures to quash infections. Mr. Liu said measures, such as compulsory mass testing, may have even contributed to spreading the virus, as some health workers who were not wearing proper protection became infected themselves.",新疆自治区副主席刘苏社本周承认，这个有2200万人口的地区正面临着有史以来最严峻的重大突发公共卫生事件。他说，一些官员有松懈麻痹思想，没有采取适当措施遏制感染。刘苏社还表示，有些措施，比如强制性全员检测，甚至可能是病毒传播的原因之一，一些核酸采样人员由于防护不当自己也被感染。
"On Tuesday, Xinjiang effectively banned residents and visitors from leaving, stopping all trains and buses from departing the region and stopping most flights. But such lockdowns could lead to more problems. Last month, residents in Yining, a city in Xinjiang, flooded social media platforms to plead for food and other provisions, including sanitary pads and medicine, during a long lockdown. Shortage of daily necessities, as well as the chaotic enforcement of attempts to curb the outbreak, had already forced local officials to admit failings.",新疆已在周二事实上禁止了居民和游客离开当地，停止了所有从新疆发车的列车和长途汽车，并停飞了大部分航班。但这种封锁可能会导致更多的问题。上个月，新疆伊宁市的居民曾在长达数周的封控期间涌上社交媒体平台，请求提供食物和其他物资，包括卫生巾和药品。生活必需品的短缺，以及试图控制疫情的政策执行混乱，迫使当地官员承认了失误。
"Similar problems in other areas, most notably in Shanghai earlier this year and in Tibet a few weeks ago, have led to anger about the human and economic toll of the harsh measures.",其他地区也有类似的问题存在，尤其是在今年早些时候的上海和几周前的西藏，这些问题已引发了人们对严格措施造成的人员和经济损失的愤怒。
"In the southwest province of Yunnan, angry travelers took to the Chinese social media site Weibo to vent their anger over being stranded at the Xishuangbanna airport after flights were canceled on short notice. On Tuesday, the Xishuangbanna prefecture's health authorities tightened restrictions, effectively preventing most people from leaving.",在西南省份云南，愤怒的游客在微博上发泄他们对于航班临时取消、被迫滞留西双版纳机场的愤怒。西双版纳州卫生部门在周二加强了限制措施，导致大多数人无法离开。
"Some videos shared online showed what appeared to be guards or police officers clad in white hazmat suits carrying guns and riot shields at the airport. The weapons set off confrontations, leading to exasperated tourists shouting: ""Who are you pointing the guns at?"" The New York Times has not been able to independently verify the videos, which have mostly been censored on Chinese social media but continued to circulate widely on Twitter. Multiple calls to the airport rang unanswered on Friday.","网上分享的一些视频显示，机场里有手持枪只和防暴盾牌、身穿白色防护服的安保人员或警察。武器的出现引发了冲突，导致恼怒的游客大喊:""你们的枪指着谁?""《纽约时报》无法独立核实这些视频的真实性。中国社交媒体上的这些视频大多已被审查，但仍在Twitter上广为流传。记者周五曾多次给西双版纳机场打电话，但无人接听。"
"On Weibo, commenters who said they were in areas under lockdown in Yunnan complained about not knowing when they could leave. Many wrote that they were worried about getting basic necessities, with most supermarkets closed. Some stranded travelers formed self-help groups to exchange information.",自称位于云南被封控地区的网友在微博上抱怨，不知道什么时候才能离开。许多人写道，由于大多数超市暂停营业，他们担心买不到基本的生活必需品。一些被困的游客组成了自助小组，方便获取信息。
"In Inner Mongolia, Covid cases surged to nearly 700 on Friday the highest number among Chinese provinces from just a handful a week ago.",内蒙古上周五通报的确诊病例已飙升到近700例，是中国各个省份中最高的，而一周前的这个数字还是个位数。
"At a meeting chaired by Sun Shaocheng, the top party official of Inner Mongolia, officials were instructed to stop infections by ""killing chickens with a knife for slaughtering cows,"" a play on a Chinese idiom, to indicate that overkill was desired. ""Act faster, prevent spread and spillover, especially to Beijing,"" an official readout said. Since then, several cities and counties in the region have been placed under lockdown.","在内蒙古自治区党委书记孙绍骋主持的一次会议上，官员们接到指示，在防止感染上要采取""杀鸡用牛刀""的力度。""以快制快，防止扩散、外溢，尤其不能外溢到北京，""官方对这次会议的报道称。那之后，内蒙古的几个市县被封控。"
"Overkill is increasingly the norm. In the tropical island province of Hainan, often dubbed the Hawaii of China, the authorities ordered mass testing after just two cases were detected on Monday. The province has only recently emerged from a lockdown in August of the popular tourist city of Sanya, which trapped tens of thousands of travelers.","过度措施正越来越多地成为常态。在有""中国夏威夷""之称的热带岛屿省份海南，周一发现了仅两例感染病例后，有关部门就下令进行全员病毒检测。海南岛曾在今年8月对热门旅游城市三亚进行过封控，最近才从那次导致了数万名游客滞留的封控中恢复过来。"
"Public anger over the lockdowns has at times soared to unusual levels, including last month after a bus transferring people to quarantine crashed, killing 27 people in the southern city of Guiyang. On social media, debates raged over whether the Covid measures have caused more damage and disruption than the virus itself.",公众对封控的愤怒有时会达到不同寻常的高度，包括上个月在南方城市贵阳，一辆将居民转运到隔离设施的大巴发生车祸，造成27人死亡。在社交媒体上，关于新冠病毒防控措施造成的伤害和破坏是否比病毒本身更大的争论非常激烈。
"Officials have struggled to fund and staff the efforts to stop the virus. In many poorer areas, local government finances have become strained, particularly as they have sought to enforce mass testing, often on millions of people every few days.",官员们在防疫资金和人员配备方面已经捉襟见肘。在许多相对贫困的地区，地方政府的财政吃紧，尤其是在他们寻求进行强制性全员病毒检测的时候，那意味着每隔几天就要给上百万人做一次检测。
"""It's simply that quite a few localities have been so exhausted,"" said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. ""One of the big challenges is that all those people have been on the front line for such a long time, the incentives are beginning to diminish in certain localities, some of the local authorities are running out of money.""","""很简单，不少地方已精疲力尽，""芝加哥大学政治学教授杨大利说。""一个巨大的挑战是，所有这些人都已在第一线工作了这么长时间，有些地方的激励措施正在开始减弱，有些地方政府的资金正在耗尽。"""
"""We have won the great battle against Covid!""","""打赢了大上海保卫战!"""
"""History will remember those who contributed!""","""历史会记住为这座城市坚守和付出的所有人!"""
"""Extinguish every outbreak!""","""发现一起，扑灭一起!"""
"These are among the many battle-style slogans that Beijing has unleashed to rally support around its top-down, zero-tolerance coronavirus policies.",这些是中国政府为其自上而下的新冠清零政策争取支持而提出的众多战斗口号之一。
"China is now one of the last places on earth trying to eliminate Covid-19, and the Communist Party has relied heavily on propaganda to justify increasingly long lockdowns and burdensome testing requirements that can sometimes lead to three tests a week.",中国现在是地球上最后几个试图消除新冠病毒的地方之一，共产党严重依赖宣传来证明越来越久的封锁和繁重的核酸检测要求(有时能达到一周三次)是合理的。
"The barrage of messages online and on television, loudspeakers and social platforms has become so overbearing that some citizens say it has drowned out their frustrations, downplayed the reality of the country's tough coronavirus rules and, occasionally, bordered on the absurd.",在网上、电视上、喇叭里和社交平台上，信息轰炸已经变得咄咄逼人，一些民众表示备感沮丧，这些信息淡化了该国严格的疫情防控的现实，有时近乎荒谬。
"By Day 8 of a citywide lockdown in Shanghai this spring, Jason Xue had no more food left in his fridge. Yet when he clicked on the government's social media account, he noticed that a top city official had vowed to ""make every possible endeavor"" to address food shortages.","在今年春天上海全城封锁期间，到了第八天的时候，杰森·薛的冰箱里已经没有食物了。然而，当他点击政府的社交媒体帐户时，他注意到一位城市高级官员誓言要""尽一切努力""解决食物短缺问题。"
"Government assistance didn't show up until four weeks later, Mr. Xue said.",薛先生说，直到四个星期后，政府的援助才出现。
"""I was extremely angry, panicked and despairing,"" said Mr. Xue, who works for a financial communications firm. He eventually turned to neighbors for help. ""The propaganda was resolute and decisive, but it was different from the reality that we didn't even know whether we could have the next meal.""","""我非常气愤，很恐慌、很绝望，""在一家金融传播公司工作的薛先生说。他最后只得向邻居求助。""表面上，propaganda(宣传)斩钉截铁，但和实际情况有很大出入，我们甚至不知道能不能吃上下一顿饭。"""
"Xi Jinping, China's leader, has made controlling the virus a ""top political priority."" Thousands of state media outlets and social media accounts have echoed Beijing's ""zero Covid"" policy and praised the sacrifice of workers trying to control Covid-19.","中国领导人习近平已将控制病毒作为""首要政治任务""。数以千计的官方媒体和社交媒体帐号呼应了北京的""清零""政策，并赞许防疫人员做出的牺牲。"
"Propaganda has long been one of the Chinese Communist Party's favored tools for social control. But in the Covid era, the government's use of it has been on overdrive. By some estimates, at least 120 Covid-related propaganda phrases have been created since the beginning of the pandemic.",长期以来，宣传一直是中共青睐的社会控制工具之一，但在新冠时代，政府更是不遗余力地使用它。据估计，自疫情开始以来，至少已经出现了120个与新冠相关的宣传词。
"When certain terms risked upsetting large numbers of people, officials simply came up with new ones. The authorities, for example, have swapped the word ""lockdown"" with ""static management,"" ""silence"" or ""working from home"" when referring to certain Covid protocols.","当某些措辞有可能让很多人感到不安时，官员们就会想出新的说法。例如，在提及某些新冠防控程序时，当局已将""封锁""一词替换为""静态管理""、""静默""或""居家办公""。"
"""Words shouldn't be used that way,"" Xiao Qiang, the founder of a California-based website that documents Chinese censorship, said in a phone interview. ""The government embellished policies with political rhetoric, aiming to mitigate fallout.""","萧强在加州创办了一个记录中国审查制度的网站。""本来话是不需要这么说的，""他在接受电话采访时表示。""官方通过政治修辞来修饰这些(防疫)政策，进而哄民众，减少他们的对抗性反应。"""
"The authorities now avoid words like ""lockdown"" because they want people to continue to obey stringent coronavirus measures without panic or resistance, Mr. Xiao added. Officials made the policy language ""ambiguous and awkward,"" he said, which has contributed to confusion and frustration.","萧强还说，当局现在避免使用""封锁""这样的字眼，因为他们希望人们继续遵守严格的新冠防疫措施，不恐慌，不抵抗。他说，官员们将政策措辞变得""混沌模糊、不伦不类""，这导致了混乱和不满。"
"When people tried to run away from quarantine buildings during an earthquake in Sichuan Province this year, epidemic workers were caught on camera blocking them from seeking safety.",今年四川省发生地震，当人们试图逃离隔离地点时，摄像头拍到防疫人员阻止人们避险。
"Videos of the episode were posted online and quickly deleted by censors, who said people should ""at least bring masks before escaping from buildings,"" even when an earthquake is ""highly destructive.""","视频被发布在网上，并很快被审查人员删除，他们说人们""应该戴上口罩再避险到室外""，哪怕地震烈度是""强破坏性的""。"
"For some, the video was a reminder of how the government had used the pandemic to tighten its grip on their private lives, telling them when they can leave their apartments, what kind of food they can buy and what hospitals they can enter.",对于一些人来说，这段视频提醒了大家，政府是如何利用疫情来加强对他们私人生活的控制的，告诉他们什么时候可以离开家，可以购买什么样的食物以及可以进入哪些医院。
"Kong Lingwanyu, a 22-year-old marketing intern in Shanghai, was upset that officials used the phrase ""unless necessary"" when describing restrictions around things like leaving the home, dining out or gathering with others.","上海22岁的营销专业实习生孔令婉玉对官员在描述离家、外出就餐或与他人聚会的限制措施时使用""非必要""一词感到不满。"

She said she asked the official what standards the government used to determine what kind of food was necessary.","她说，一位负责执行新冠病毒政策的当地官员告诉她，不应该""购买非必要食品""。她说，她问官员，政府决定哪种食品是必需品的标准是什么。"
"""Who are you to decide the 'necessity' for others?"" she said. ""It's totally absurd and nonsense.""","""凭什么由你来界定'非必要'呢'?""她说。""挺扯的，很荒诞。"""
"On state television, Beijing's ""nine storm fortification actions"" around the pandemic are frequently repeated to keep people in line with Covid policies. The nine actions are: neighborhood lockdowns, mass testing, contact tracing, disinfection, quarantine centers, increased health care capacity, traditional Chinese medicine, screening of neighborhoods and prevention of local transmission.","中国政府围绕疫情出台的""九大攻坚行动""经常在国家电视台上重复，确保人们与新冠政策保持一致。这九大行动是:社区管控行动、检测筛查行动、流调排查行动、转运隔离行动、腾换扩容行动、中医药干预行动、清洁消毒行动、""拔点""行动、防外溢行动。"
"Yang Xiao, a 33-year-old cinematographer in Shanghai who was confined to his apartment for two months during a lockdown this year, had grown tired of them all.",33岁的上海电影摄影师杨潇今年在封城期间被关在家两个月，所有这些都让他感到厌倦。
"""With the Covid control, propaganda and state power expanded and occupied all aspects of our life,"" he said in a phone interview.

He said the announcements had disturbed his sleep at night and woke him up at dawn.","""这些宣传语言在封控期间，代表公权力的扩张，渗透并控制了我们生活的方方面面，让我不知所措，""他在电话采访中说。杨潇每天听到家附近的大喇叭提醒大家做核酸。他说广播打搅他睡觉，一大早就把他吵醒。"
"""Our life was dictated and disciplined by propaganda and state power,"" he said.","""我们的生活完全被宣传话语和公权力所支配和规训了，""他说。"
"To communicate his frustrations, Mr. Yang selected 600 common Chinese propaganda phrases, such as ""core awareness,"" ""obey the overall situation"" and ""the supremacy of nationhood."" He gave each phrase a number and then put the numbers into Google's Random Generator, a program that scrambles data.","为了表达自己的不满，杨潇选择了600个常用的中国宣传用语，如""核心意识""、""服从大局""、""民族至上""等。他给每个短语一个数字编号，然后将数字输入谷歌的随机生成器，一个将数据顺序打乱的程序。"
"He ended up with senseless phrases such as ""detect citizens' life and death line,"" ""strictly implement functions"" and ""specialize overall plans without slack."" Then he used a voice program to read the phrases aloud and played the audio on a loudspeaker in his neighborhood.","他最后得到了一些无意义的词句，如""检测公民生死线""、""严格落实职能""、""专业化统筹兼顾不懈怠""等。然后，他使用语音程序大声朗读这些口号，并在他家附近的扬声器上播放。"
No one seemed to notice the five minutes of computer-generated nonsense.,似乎没有人注意到这些由计算机生成的五分钟废话。
"When Mr. Yang uploaded a video of the scene online, however, more than 1.3 million people viewed it. Many praised the way he used government language as satire. Chinese propaganda was ""too absurd to be criticized using logic,"" Mr. Yang said. ""I simulated the discourse like a mirror, reflecting its own absurdity.""","然而，在他将这一幕放到网上后，超过130万人观看了该视频。许多人称赞他使用政府语言进行讽刺。中国的宣传语言""太荒诞了，如果我用逻辑去批判它，太苍白了""，杨潇说。""所以我想直接给它一面镜子，让它自己照到自己，看到自己的荒谬，用荒谬来打败荒谬。"""
Spoofing Chinese propaganda:,恶搞中国宣传:
His video was taken down by censors.,这段视频遭到了删除。
Mr. Yang added that he hoped to inspire others to speak out against China's Covid policies and its use of propaganda in the pandemic. He wasn't the only Shanghai resident to rebel when the city was locked down.,杨潇还说，他希望激励其他人公开反对中国的新冠病毒政策及其在疫情中使用的宣传手段。当这座城市被封锁时，他并不是唯一一个反抗的上海居民。
"In June, dozens of residents protested against the police and Covid control workers who installed chain-link fences around neighborhood apartments. When a protester was shoved into a police car and taken away, one man shouted: ""Freedom! Equality! Justice! Rule of law!"" Those words would be familiar to most Chinese citizens: They are commonly cited by state media as core socialist values under Mr. Xi.","6月，数十名居民抗议警察和防疫人员在小区周围安装铁丝网围栏。当一名抗议者被推进警车带走时，一名男子高喊:""自由!平等!公正!法治!""大多数中国公民都熟悉这些词:它们是媒体经常提及的习近平领导下的社会主义核心价值观。"
Liu Jingyao is not the first young woman to accuse a powerful Chinese businessman of rape. She is not the only Chinese woman to confront a man and seek legal charges against him.,Liu Jingyao不是第一个指控有权势的中国富商强奸的年轻女性。她也不是唯一一个与男人对质并寻求法律指控的中国女性。
But she is one of the first to pursue her case in an American courtroom.,但她是第一批为此在美国上法庭的人之一。
That could make all of the difference for Ms. Liu and for the nascent #MeToo movement in China.,"这可能对Liu Jingyao和中国新生的""我也是""(#MeToo)运动产生重大影响。"
"Jury selection begins Thursday in Minneapolis in the civil trial against one of the world's most prominent tech billionaires, known as Richard Liu in the English-speaking world and as Liu Qiangdong in China.

"Ms. Liu, who is unrelated to Mr. Liu, says that the businessman followed her back to her Minneapolis apartment and raped her after an alcohol-soaked 2018 dinner for Chinese executives that she attended as a University of Minnesota volunteer, according to court filings. He has denied the allegations, insisting that the sex was consensual.",法庭文件显示，Liu Jingyao说，在2018年她作为明尼苏达大学志愿者参加了一场为中国高管举行的酒局晚宴后，这名商人跟着她回到了明尼阿波利斯的公寓并强奸了她。刘强东否认了这些指控，坚称性行为是双方自愿的。
"Local prosecutors that yeardeclined to chargeMr. Liu with sexual assault. Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, said at the time that it was a ""complicated situation,"" and his office determined that there were evidentiary problems that would have made it highly unlikely that a criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.","当年，地方检察官拒绝以性侵罪名指控刘强东。亨内平县检察官迈克·弗里曼当时表示""情况复杂""，他的办公室认为存在证据问题，这使得在排除合理怀疑的情况下证明刑事指控的可能性极小。"
"But Ms. Liu, who remains in the United States and has endured abarrage of attackson Chinese social media, has persisted in her efforts to seek a decision through the civil court system, where the burden of proof is lower. She is asking for at least $50,000 in damages.",但仍在美国、并在中国的社交媒体上遭到攻击的Liu Jingyao一直在坚持，努力向举证责任较低的民事法院系统寻求裁决。她要求至少5万美元的赔偿金。
"The trial is significant for the fact that it is happening at all. Mr. Liu is one of the highest-profile Chinese figures who have been accused of sexual assault or rape to face the scrutiny of a courtroom jury. Such accusations against well-known business executives and politicians rarely make it to trial in China, where the ruling Communist Party has repeatedly quashed the country's small but spirited #MeToo movement.","这场审判之所以意义重大，是因为它能够走到这一步。刘强东是因性侵犯或强奸指控而面临法庭陪审团审视的最受瞩目的中国公众人物之一。知名企业高管和政界人士很少因此类指控在中国受到审判，执政的共产党一再镇压该国规模虽小但意志高昂的""我也是""运动。"
"Xiaowen Liang, a Chinese feminist activist and lawyer based in New York, said that while the events had taken place halfway across the world in Minneapolis, the story was all too familiar for women in China.",常驻纽约的中国女权活动家兼律师梁晓雯表示，虽然事件发生在地球另一端的明尼阿波利斯，但这个故事对中国女性来说再熟悉不过了。
"""Many women in China have had similar experiences with this workplace culture of drinking, dinner and sexual harassment,"" Ms. Liang said.","""中国的许多女性在这种酒局、晚宴和性骚扰的职场文化中都有过类似的经历，""梁晓雯说。"
"If Ms. Liu won the case, she added, it could inject some much-needed momentum into China's struggling #MeToo movement by inspiring Chinese feminists to continue their advocacy. ""Especially under these circumstances where all the grass-roots organizing effort has been cracked down on in China, this would be the win that we all need.""","她还说，如果Liu Jingyao赢了官司，可以通过激励中国女权主义者继续倡导，为中国苦苦挣扎的""我也是""运动注入一些亟需的动力。""特别是在中国所有的基层组织活动都被打压的情况下，这将是我们都需要的胜利。"""
"The case has riveted China since the accusations first surfaced, and the trial comes at an exceedingly sensitive time for the country's top leader, Xi Jinping, who is expected to take an unprecedented third term during an important political meeting that opens in Beijing on Oct. 16.",自从指控首次浮出水面以来，此案就在中国引发关注，而对于中国最高领导人习近平来说，审判正值一个极其敏感的时刻，预计他将在10月16日北京开幕的一个重要政治会议上获得史无前例的第三个任期。
"Such events are often tightly choreographed, and official censors typically go into overdrive before the meetings to minimize disruptions. The Chinese government authorities may see the accusations against Mr. Liu as less threatening because he is a private sector executive, but they also may not want the case to draw attention away from Mr. Xi.",此类活动通常经过精密编排，官方审查人员往往会在会前全力以赴，尽量减少干扰。中国政府当局可能认为对刘强东的指控危害较小，因为他是民营企业的高管，但他们也可能不希望此案转移对习近平的关注。
"The trial is expected to shed new light on the private dealings of China's political and business elite information that the Communist Party would almost certainly prefer to keep hidden. In her court filings, Ms. Liu has already recounted details, including conversations about private jets and mistresses, that describe an unseemly side to wealthy, jet-setting Chinese businessmen with high-level political connections.",预计该审判将为中国政商勾结提供新的线索——共产党几乎肯定更希望隐藏这些信息。在她的法庭文件中，Liu Jingyao已经讲述了其中一些细节，包括关于私人飞机和情妇的谈话，这些谈话描述了中国拥有高层政治关系的富商们丑陋的一面。
"According to court documents, among those who attended the Minneapolis dinner were Li Botan, the son-in-law of Jia Qinglin, a former member of China's Politburo Standing Committee, the country's elite decision-making body; and Li Wa, who has gone into business with Mr. Xi's brother-in-law, Deng Jiagui.",法庭文件显示，出席明尼阿波利斯晚宴的有中国精英决策机构——政治局前常委贾庆林的女婿李伯潭，以及与习近平的姐夫邓家贵做生意的李华(音)。
"Ms. Liu, who grew up in China, had just transferred to the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management in the summer of 2018 when a professor recruited her to volunteer for a weeklong business executive program. Toward its end, she said in court filings, one of the Chinese executives invited her to a Japanese restaurant in Minneapolis for what she thought was a dinner to honor the volunteers.",Liu Jingyao在中国长大，2018年夏天，她刚刚转学到明尼苏达大学卡尔森管理学院，一位教授招募她为长达一周的企业高管课程做志愿者。她在法庭文件中说，临近课程结束的时候，其中一名中国高管邀请她到明尼阿波利斯的一家日本餐馆吃饭，她以为晚宴是为了感谢志愿者。
"When she showed up, she was shown to a seat at a table with 15 middle-aged men and was instructed to sit beside Mr. Liu, she said in court documents. At Chinese business dinners, it is customary for young women to be placed next to important middle-aged men to entertain them. Among the group of men, Mr. Liu was the best known a celebrity in China, known for his humble beginnings, his enormous wealth and his high-profile marriage to Zhang Zetian, a social media icon known as Sister Milk Tea.","她在法庭文件中说，当她到场时，被带到了与15名中年男子同桌的座位上，并被指示坐在刘强东的旁边。在中国的商务晚宴上，年轻女性通常被安排在重要的中年男性旁边招待他们。这群男人中最知名的就是刘强东，他是中国的名人，以出身平凡、拥有巨额财富以及与社交媒体上的偶像人物""奶茶妹妹""章泽天的高调婚姻而闻名。"
"Over the course of the more than two-hour dinner, according to the filings, the party made numerous toasts, and Ms. Liu was pressured to drink repeatedly. The man sitting across from Ms. Liu passed out on the table from drinking, based on surveillance video submitted to the court.",文件显示，在两个多小时的晚宴过程中，派对上的人多次敬酒，Liu Jingyao多次被迫喝酒。根据提交给法庭的监控录像，坐在Liu Jingyao对面的男子在桌上醉倒。
"After the dinner, Ms. Liu left with Mr. Liu and two of his assistants in a chauffeured car. Inside, Mr. Liu began to grope Ms. Liu without her consent, she said. The chauffeur said in his deposition that Mr. Liu had ""overpowered"" and ""manhandled"" Ms. Liu at one point, but he also told the police that he hadn't heard anyone protesting or asking for help.","晚宴后，Liu Jingyao和刘强东以及他的两名助手乘坐专车离开。她说，在车里，刘强东未经同意就开始摸她。司机在证词中说，刘强东曾一度""制服""Liu Jingyao并""动粗""，但他也告诉警方，他没有听到任何人抗议或求助。"
"Mr. Liu accompanied Ms. Liu back to her apartment and entered uninvited, she asserted in the filings. Ms. Liu several hours later told a fellow volunteer that she had been raped after a ""prolonged struggle."" The person contacted the police, she said in the filings.","Liu Jingyao在文件中称，刘强东陪她回到公寓，并在未被邀请的情况下进入。几个小时后，Liu Jingyao告诉一名志愿者同伴，经过""长时间的挣扎""，她被强奸了。她在文件中说，此人联系了警方。"
"""We have gathered so much more evidence than the police did in their investigation,"" said Wil Florin, a lawyer for Ms. Liu.","""我们收集的证据比警方在调查中收集的证据多得多，""Liu Jingyao的律师威尔·弗洛林说。"
"Mr. Liu's representatives disputed Ms. Liu's account and said her recollection of events had shifted. They have pointed to statements given by Ms. Liu in which she wavered on the question of whether she was raped. They have also cited surveillance video that appeared to show Ms. Liu pressing the elevator buttons in her apartment building without hesitation, saying it contradicted her statement to police that she had been too drunk to see the buttons clearly.",刘强东的代表对Liu Jingyao的描述提出了质疑，说她对事件的回忆跟之前不一样。他们指出，Liu Jingyao在陈述中对自己是否被强奸的问题显得摇摆不定。他们还指出监控录像显示，Liu Jingyao毫不犹豫地按下公寓电梯里的按钮，称这与她对警方陈述自己当时醉了，看不清按钮的说法相矛盾。
"""There are dozens and dozens of inconsistent statements she has made and big ones,"" said Diane Doolittle, an attorney for Mr. Liu.","刘强东的律师戴安·杜利特尔说:""她有几十个自相矛盾的陈述，而且是重大的陈述。"""
"Outside the community of overseas Chinese students and diaspora Chinese, the case has drawn a muted reaction in the United States compared with other #MeToo cases. Some local activists, though, have raised questions about the University of Minnesota's handling of the events, including the role a professor played in helping Mr. Liu secure a lawyer in the immediate aftermath of his arrest.","与其他""我也是""事件相比，此案在美国引起的反应较为平淡，只在海外中国留学生和海外华人社区激起反响。不过，一些当地活动人士对明尼苏达大学处理此事的方式提出了质疑，其中包括一名教授在刘强东被捕后立即帮助他请到律师方面发挥的作用。"
"Jake Ricker, a university spokesman, said that the university typically did not comment on active litigation. He added that the university had ""fully and appropriately"" responded to the situation when it arose in 2018.","该校发言人杰克·里克表示，该校通常不对正在进行的诉讼置评。他还说，当2018年事发之时，该大学做出了""充分而适当""的回应。"
Ms. Liu graduated from the university last spring and is currently in a graduate program at Washington University in St. Louis.,Liu Jingyao去年春天从这所大学毕业，目前在圣路易斯的华盛顿大学攻读研究生课程。
"She is seeking compensation and punitive damages in the case against Mr. Liu and JD.com. The dinner was paid for using a JD.com corporate credit card, according to her filings. Mr. Liu stepped down as chief executive of JD.com in April, though he remains chairman of the company.",她在针对刘强东和京东的案件中寻求赔偿和惩罚性损害赔偿。据她提交的文件显示，这顿晚餐是用京东的企业信用卡支付的。今年4月，刘强东辞去了京东首席执行官一职，但仍担任该公司董事长。
"Mr. Liu, who is worth as much as $11.5 billion, according to Forbes, is expected to testify in court in Minneapolis after the trial begins on Oct. 3, his lawyers said. Over the weekend, photos on Chinese social media appeared to show Mr. Liu shopping at a store in Minneapolis with his pregnant wife.",据《福布斯》报道，刘强东的身价高达115亿美元。刘强东的律师说，预计他将在10月3日开庭后在明尼阿波利斯出庭作证。上周末，中国社交媒体上的照片似乎显示，刘强东和他怀孕的妻子在明尼阿波利斯的一家商店购物。
"Ms. Liu said in court filings that sheexperienced post-traumatic stress disorder and that she was under a constant cloud of fear that Mr. Liu could use his power and influence to retaliate against her and her family in China. For nearly two years after she came forward, Ms. Liu faced an onslaught of criticism from Chinese internet users. Hashtags relating to her case were viewed hundreds of millions of times. On social media, she was called ""a slut,"" ""a liar"" and ""a gold digger,"" among other names.","Liu Jingyao在提交给法院的文件中说，她患了创伤后应激障碍，一直处于恐惧的阴影中，担心刘强东会利用他的权力和影响力报复她和她在中国的家人。在Liu Jingyao站出来后的近两年里，她一直面临着中国网民的猛烈抨击。与她的案件相关的话题标签被浏览了数亿次。在社交媒体上，她被称为""荡妇""、""骗子""、""捞女""等。"
"But Ms. Liu has a strong base of supporters. In 2019, many rallied behind Ms. Liu using hashtags like #NoPerfectVictim, sparking a broader debate in China about rape culture and consent.",但Liu Jingyao也拥有众多支持者。2019年，许多人使用#非完美受害者#等标签声援她，在中国引发了一场关于强奸文化和性同意的更广泛讨论。
HONG KONG Luxury storefronts have been replaced by pop-up shops selling masks. Whole floors of skyscrapers are deserted. Streets once crammed with locals and visitors jostling for space are quiet.,香港——销售奢侈品的店铺被卖口罩的快闪店取代。摩天大楼整层整层地空着。曾经挤满了当地人和游客的街道现在悄无声息。
"This is ""Asia's World City,"" Hong Kong's self-appointed title, after more than two years under some of the world's toughest pandemic rules. The city now wants to reclaim that cosmopolitan status by taking its biggest step toward living with Covid-19: scrapping a crushing quarantine mandate that at one point required 21 days in a designated hotel and easing restrictions on the global gatherings that gave it its reputation as an international metropolis.","这就是自诩为""亚洲国际都会""的香港的现状，两年多来，香港一直实行着世界上一些最严厉的新冠防疫规定。现在，它希望通过朝着与新冠病毒共存方向迈出的最大一步来恢复其国际大都市的地位。政府取消了对当地打击惨重的强制性酒店隔离措施(曾一度要求入境人员在指定酒店隔离21天)，并放松了对举办全球性活动的限制，这些活动曾让香港拥有国际大都会的名声。"
"But uncertainty lingers over the new approach, which still prohibits visitors from going to places considered high risk like restaurants, bars and gyms during their first three days in the city, and many industry leaders say the changes are not enough to pull Hong Kong out of an economic recession and restore its once-clamorous social life.",但新政策仍存在不确定性，入境人员在抵达香港的前三天仍被禁止前往餐馆、酒吧和健身房等被视为高风险的地方。许多工商界领袖表示，新政策不足以扭转香港的经济衰退，恢复曾经喧嚣的社会生活。
"There are deeper worries, too. The fact that Hong Kong began to diverge from China's ""zero Covid"" policy only after Beijing gave its blessing has touched off worries over the city's broader loss of autonomy. Before the pandemic, the former British colony was already changing in irreversible ways after months of citywide pro-democracy protests. Beijing then unleashed a devastating crackdown that shut down or pushed out some of the people and things that made Hong Kong unique to the rest of China: a politically boisterous, irreverent, semiautonomous city.","还有更深层次的担忧。在得到了中央政府的许可后，香港才开始偏离中国的""新冠清零""政策，这个事实已引发了人们对香港已丧失大部分自治权的担忧。疫情前，这个英国前殖民地就已在以不可逆转的方式发生变化。香港曾发生了持续数月的大规模民主抗议活动，后来中央政府发起严厉镇压，许多人被逮捕，机构被关闭，一些人被赶走。这些人和事的存在曾让香港不同与中国其他地方:它本来是一个充满政治活力、对政府不恭的半自治城市。"
"""For Hong Kong's international credibility, it is shot to pieces,"" said David Webb, a longtime corporate governance activist in Hong Kong. As the city scrambled to get a grip on a Covid outbreak earlier this year, its leaders fumbled. They lurched back and forth between insisting on ever-more restrictive policies that mirrored China's own draconian approach and backing off, panicking residents and triggering an exodus, predominantly of foreigners.","""就香港的国际信誉而言，它已被彻底损坏，""曾长期在香港从事公司治理活动的戴维·韦布说。今年早些时候，香港领导人在控制新冠疫情上不知所措，一会儿坚持与中国内地的严厉做法接轨，一会儿又要放弃那种措施，结果在当地居民中引起恐慌，导致很多人离港，其中以外国人为主。"
"""What happens the next time there is a health threat?"" Mr. Webb asked. ""They have done permanent damage to our reputation as having autonomy in matters like this.""","""下次出现公共卫生威胁时会怎样呢?""韦布问道。""他们已给我们在这类问题上拥有自主权的声誉造成了永久性损害。"""
"Under John Lee, a former police officer who became the city's chief executive in July, Hong Kong has loosened restrictions more quickly than at any point in the pandemic. He has assured residents that the city will continue to move in that direction while emphasizing the need to also protect people from future outbreaks.",前警务官员李家超今年7月出任香港行政长官后，香港放松防疫限制的速度比疫情期间的任何时候都快。李家超向居民保证，香港将继续朝放松的方向移动，同时强调有必要保护人民不受未来疫情的影响。
Other politicians have struck a similar tone.,香港的其他政客也发表了类似的言论。
"""We have not lost the title you could say it's a bit tarnished,"" said Tommy Cheung, a legislative councilor representing the catering industry and an adviser to Mr. Lee. ""We have more people leaving than coming, but that happens all over the world. That doesn't mean we are no longer a global city.""","""我们并没有失去那个称号，你也可以说它有一点儿受损，""代表餐饮界的立法会议员、李家超的顾问张宇人说。""离开香港的比来的人多，但世界各地都有这种情况。这并不意味着我们不再是一个国际城市。"""
"Despite the positive spin, the damage of the past few years has been devastating. After decades in Hong Kong, many multinational companies have pulled their headquarters and staff out, moving to less restrictive places like Singapore and Seoul. International teachers, foreign athletes and many of Hong Kong's own professional elite have left. For many, the move is permanent, but for some, Covid was only the latest worry.",虽然存在正面的看法，但香港在过去几年里遭受的打击是毁灭性的。许多在香港经营了几十年的跨国公司已将总部和员工迁出，搬到新加坡和首尔等防疫限制不那么严格的地方。在国际学校教书的教师、外国运动员和许多本地专业精英都已离开。对许多人来说，离开是永久性的，但对一些人来说，新冠病毒只是最近的担忧。
"""In some ways, Hong Kong is just another big city in China now,"" said Meredith Haskins, a former teacher at Hong Kong International School who retired in June. Teachers have left amid continuing school disruptions and fears about possible mass testing and family separations in government quarantine. A long stretch of a mandatory 21-day hotel quarantine for many arrivals and several rounds of social distancing measures have weighed on families.","""在某些方面，香港现在只不过是另一个中国大城市而已，""梅雷迪思·哈斯金斯说，她曾在香港国际学校任教，已于今年6月退休。由于学校持续停课，教师们纷纷离开，他们也担心可能要被迫接受全员病毒检测，被送往政府的集中隔离设施致使家人分离。对许多入境人员实行21天的酒店强制隔离以及几轮保持社交距离的措施给家庭带来了压力。"
"But the city's changing political atmosphere has cast a shadow, too. Curriculum guidelines issued by the government last year emphasize loyalty to mainland China, its leaders and its coercive methods, and many worry that it is only a matter of time before the new national security law negatively affects curriculums at international schools. Schools have had difficulty filling positions.",但香港不断变化的政治气氛也给人们的内心投下了阴影。政府去年公布的课程指引强调了对中国大陆、中央领导人，以及中央政府强制做法的忠诚，这让许多人担心，新的国安法对国际学校的课程产生负面影响只是个时间问题。国际学校在填补空缺职位上已遇到困难。
"Strict Covid rules have also made it hard for foreign businesses to persuade employees not to leave Hong Kong. Companies have complained that even with the loosened rules, travel barriers remain for new hires from abroad and those who want to visit for a conference.",遏制新冠病毒的严格规定也让外国企业难以说服员工留在香港。企业抱怨，即使放松了规定，但对从海外雇来的新员工和想来参加会议的人来说，仍存在旅行障碍。
"Whether Hong Kong can return to being an attractive city for foreign businesses ""would mean a massive effort to rebuild Hong Kong's global image,"" said Frederik Gollob, the chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.","香港能否重新成为对外国企业有吸引力的城市，""意味着付出巨大努力重塑香港的全球形象，""香港欧洲商会主席高飞(Frederik Gollob)说。"
"Finance industry professionals are even more explicit. To regain its competitiveness, they say, Hong Kong has to put itself back on a par with other international financial centers like London, New York and Singapore.",金融行业的专业人士则更明确。他们说，香港要想重新获得竞争力，就必须回到与伦敦、纽约、新加坡等其他国际金融中心同等水平的做法。
"""It is incumbent upon the government to wean the community away from being fixated on Covid return to normalcy is key,"" said Sally Wong, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association, which represents big global investment firms including BlackRock. In a recent survey from the group, more than a third of investment firms said they had moved some or all their regional and global executives out of Hong Kong.","""政府有责任让社区摆脱对新冠病毒的过度关注，回归正常才是关键，""香港投资基金公会行政总裁黄王慈明说，该公会代表着包括贝莱德在内的一些大型全球投资公司。在它最近所做的一项调查中，超过三分之一的投资公司表示，它们已将地区和全球高管部分或全部迁出了香港。"
"The exodus has been harmful to the economy and Hong Kong's labor force, which has shrunk to a decade low. The city's financial secretary warned this month that Hong Kong was likely to finish the year in a recession.",这种外流已给香港经济和劳动力造成了不利影响，香港的劳动力已萎缩到10年来的最低水平。香港财政司司长本月警告，香港很可能在经济衰退中结束今年。
Parts of pre-Covid Hong Kong will probably never return.,香港疫情前的某些东西可能永远不会再回来。
"Media companies, including The New York Times, and nongovernmental organizations began moving staff to other Asian cities like Seoul and Tokyo in 2020, over uncertainty that followed Beijing's imposition of the sweeping new national security law.",由于中央政府对香港实施涉及范围广泛的国安法带来的不确定性，包括《纽约时报》在内的媒体公司和非政府组织已从2020年开始将员工转移到首尔和东京等其他亚洲城市。
Much of Hong Kong's once-vibrant civil society is unlikely to return. Some industries that depend on the city's open border are cautiously optimistic but unsure whether the easing of Covid restrictions goes far enough.,香港一度生机勃勃的公民社会也不太可能回来。一些依赖香港开放边境的行业虽然保持谨慎的乐观，但对与新冠疫情有关的限制是否已放得足够宽没有把握。
"An early test will be the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament, one of the city's best-known sports events, which will take place in November for the first time since the start of the pandemic.",一个较早的检验将是香港七人橄榄球锦标赛，这是香港最著名的体育赛事之一，将于今年11月举行，是疫情暴发以来的首次。
"Presale tickets are down 30 percent from 2019, as international corporate sponsors express uncertainty about the event, said Robbie McRobbie, chief executive of the Hong Kong Rugby Union. Overseas spectators will not be able to attend until they have passed three days of health monitoring.",香港榄球总会行政总裁麦伟彬(Robbie McRobbie)说，由于国际企业赞助商们对赛事表达了不确定性，预售门票较2019年下降了30%。海外观众必须在入境后进行三天自我医学观察，然后才能去现场观赛。
"""Whether or not we will be able to put up the sold-out signs, I'm not sure at this stage,"" Mr. McRobbie said. There is also confusion over whether the 350 athletes, coaches, referees and medical-support teams will have to remain in a closed loop for the first three days, restricted to their hotel and the stadium.","""门票是否能售罄，现阶段还不确定，""麦伟彬说。还有一个问题是，350名运动员、教练、裁判和医疗支持团队在抵达香港的头三天里，是否需要呆在一个限于酒店和体育场的闭环内。"
"The main beneficiaries of quarantine changes so far have been tour operators. ""It's a very positive direction,"" said Moon Yau, the assistant general manager at Sunflower Travel Services, which does tours to Japan, Europe and mainland China. Since Friday, when officials announced the change in rules, he had received more than 300 inquiries a day about trips, he said. He added that for now, they had been mostly residents taking their first overseas holiday in nearly three years.","到目前为止，放松入境规定的主要受益者是旅游业经营者。""这是旅游业非常正向的方向，""新华旅游有限公司助理总经理尤满意说，新华旅游为人们安排去日本、欧洲和中国大陆的旅行。他表示，自从上周五官员宣布放松入境规定以来，他每天收到300多份有关旅行的询问。他补充说，就目前而言，询问主要来自当地居民，他们是近三年来首次去海外度假。"
"For others, the impact is more mixed. The first weekend after the announced changes, revenues fell at Black Sheep Restaurants' nearly 40 restaurants across the city, said Syed Asim Hussain, a co-founder, as residents rushed to leave the city on long-planned overseas trips. The new rules are not enough to bring people to Hong Kong, he said, and he plans to write a complaint to the government.",对其他人来说，放松入境规定的影响好坏参半。宣布放松入境规定后的第一个周末，餐饮集团Black Sheep Restaurants在香港各地的近40家餐厅都出现了收入下滑的情况，集团联合创始人赛义德·阿西姆·侯赛因说，因为居民们急于离开香港，开始计划已久的海外旅行。他说，新规定还不足以吸引人们来香港，他打算给政府写信抱怨。
"He said he also wonders whether Hong Kong has changed irrevocably after months of protests, the silencing of dissent that followed and more than two years of isolation.",他说，他还想知道，经过了几个月的抗议、对异见人士的镇压，以及两年多的边境封锁后，香港是否已发生了不可逆转的变化。
"""My industry demands that I be optimistic, but I haven't found many reasons for optimism for three years,"" Mr. Hussain said. ""It's been so difficult. In some ways even though safety is in sight it is more frustrating.""","""我的行业要求我保持乐观，但三年来我没有找到太多乐观的理由，""侯赛因说。""一直有太多的困难。从某个方面来看，尽管安全在望，但更令人沮丧。"""
"""I definitely feel,"" he added, ""that we have been through something really heavy collectively, as a community.""","""我的确觉得，作为一个社会，我们共同经历了一些非常沉重的事情，""他补充说。"
"When Qu Tongzhou, a photography assistant in Shanghai, set out on a long-awaited trip to western China in June, she found the cities she visited to be unwelcoming. As an aftereffect of the country's ""zero-Covid"" policies, locals were leery of travelers, and some hotels refused Ms. Qu, fearing she could introduce the virus.","今年6月，上海的摄影助理屈童舟前往中国西部开始期待已久的旅行，她发现所到城市对她都不太欢迎。由于中国""清零""政策的影响，当地人对游客持怀疑态度，一些酒店拒绝屈童舟入住，担心她会将病毒带进来。"
"So Ms. Qu turned to Tantan and Jimu, two popular Chinese dating apps with Tinder-like features. She was aware of the risks involved in meeting strangers, but the apps yielded a wellspring of new friends, including a biotech entrepreneur in the city of Lanzhou, a Tibetan doctor in the town of Xining, and a public official in Karamay, a northwest city of Xinjiang. At each stop, her matches provided lodging and took her to bars and other local spots.","屈童舟只好向中国两款颇受欢迎的约会应用程序""探探""和""积目""求助，它们的功能与Tinder类似。她知道与陌生人见面有风险，但这些软件为她带来了大量新朋友，包括兰州市的一名生物技术企业家、西宁市的一名藏医，以及新疆西北部城市克拉玛依市的一名公务员。每到一站，她结交的朋友都为她提供住宿，带她去了当地酒吧和其他地方。"
"""If I didn't use these apps, I wouldn't have met many people,"" Ms. Qu, 28, said. ""No one would have taken me out on the town.""","""如果不用软件，可能没有人陪我一起玩，""28岁的屈童舟说。""没有人带我玩。"""
"Over the past two years, China has cracked down on much of its domestic technology industry, banning for-profit online tutoring agencies, restricting video games and slapping multi-billion-dollar antitrust fines on the largest online shopping platforms. Some of China's once-vaunted tech titans, like Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce firm Alibaba, have stepped back from public view.",过去两年间，中国严厉打压大部分国内技术行业，禁止了以盈利为目的的在线辅导服务机构，对网络游戏进行限制，并对最大的在线购物平台开出了上百亿元的反垄断罚单。中国一些曾被大肆吹捧的技术巨头，比如电子商务集团阿里巴巴的创始人马云，已退出了公众视野。
But one corner of China's technology industry has flourished: dating apps.,但中国技术行业的一个角落仍在蓬勃发展:约会应用程序。
"The number of dating apps in China with over 1,000 downloads soared to 275 this year from 81 in 2017, according to data.ai, an analytics firm. Downloads of the apps have increased, as have in-app purchases.",据分析公司data.ai，中国下载量千次以上的约会应用程序数量，已从2017年的81个飙升至今年的275个。除下载量外，这些软件的应用内购买也有所增长。
"Investors have also poured more than $5.3 billion into dating and social networking companies in the country last year, up from $300 million in 2019, according to PitchBook. And China's largest tech companies, such as ByteDance and Tencent, are testing, acquiring and investing in new apps that promise to bring strangers together.",据PitchBook的数据，投资者去年向中国的约会应用和社交网络公司投入了超过相当于53亿美元的资金，高于2019年的3亿美元。字节跳动和腾讯等中国最大的技术企业正在测试、收购和投资许诺让陌生人相识的新应用。
"These apps are flourishing and Beijing appears to be leaving them alone for more than just romantic reasons. They promise to nudge people toward marriage at a time when China's marriage and fertility rates are at record lows, but the apps also are helping users combat loneliness as Covid lockdowns have wreaked havoc on social connections.",这些应用正在蓬勃发展，而中国政府似乎对它们不闻不问，其原因不仅是爱情。在中国的结婚率和生育率处于历史最低水平的时候，这些软件除了许诺将人们带入婚姻殿堂外，也在中国遏制新冠病毒的封控措施严重破坏社会交往的时候，帮助用户减轻孤独感。
"For many people, the apps have become virtual sanctuaries a 21st-century twist on what urbanists called the ""third place,"" a community between work and the home to explore hobbies, discuss popular topics and meet new friends.","对许多用户来说，这些软件已成为虚拟的庇护所，可以说是城市学家所谓的""第三场所""(介于工作和家庭之间的社区)的21世纪变种，让人们可以探索兴趣爱好、讨论热门话题、结识新朋友。"
"""It's really difficult to meet people offline,"" said Raphael Zhao, 25, a recent college graduate in Beijing. Mr. Zhao downloaded Tantan in April after being locked down on his campus over zero-Covid measures.

"Chinese authorities have taken action against dating apps in the past. In 2019, Tantan and another dating app called Momo suspended some in-app features after regulators dinged them for neglecting the spread of pornographic content on their platforms.","中国当局过去曾对约会应用采取过行动。2019年，监管机构指责探探和另一个平台""陌陌""听任用户在其平台上传播色情内容之后，这两个平台暂停了一些应用内功能。"
"But unlike online tutoring and cryptocurrency trading, areas that China's regulators have unambiguously quashed, dating and other services centered on social encounters have remained relatively unscathed as the apps have explicitly framed their goals as helping Chinese society to thrive.",但与中国监管机构已明文取缔的在线辅导和加密货币交易不同，约会及其他以社交为中心的服务受到的监管相对来说少得多，因为这些平台将自己的目标清楚地定位为帮助中国社会繁荣发展。
"Zhang Lu, the founder of Soul, a dating app backed by Tencent, has said that ""loneliness is the core problem we want to solve."" Blued, the most popular gay dating app, bills itself as a public health and H.I.V.-awareness app. Its site highlights its work on H.I.V. prevention, collaborations with local governments, and its founder's encounters with high-ranking officials such as Premier Li Keqiang. (Blued's founder stepped down last month, alluding to the challenges of running a L.G.B.T.Q. app in China, but the app's downloads have remained constant.)","腾讯投资的交友软件Soul的创始人张璐表示，""孤独感就是我们核心要解决的问题。""中国最受欢迎的同性恋社交软件Blued，把自己宣传为一款公共卫生和增强艾滋病毒意识的应用。其网站强调艾滋病毒预防工作，与地方政府的合作，以及软件创始人受国务院总理李克强等高官接见的情景。(Blued的创始人已在上月辞职，间接地显示了在中国运营一款LGBTQ应用所面临的挑战，但该软件的下载量一直很稳定。)"
"""Rather than simply cracking down, dating apps are seen as technologies that can be effectively co-opted by the state,"" said Yun Zhou, an assistant professor of sociology and Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan.","""政府把交友软件视为一种可被国家有效利用的技术，而不是简单地打击它们，""密歇根大学社会学系和中国研究助理教授周云(音)说。"
"When internet dating arrived in China in the early 2000s, the power to form relationships once disproportionately in the hands of village matchmakers, parents and factory bosses increasingly fell onto the individual. Many were eager for the shift, gravitating to features on WeChat, the popular messaging app, which enabled chatting with strangers.",在中国，乡下的媒人、父母，以及工厂老板曾经掌握大量建立亲密关系的权力，自网上交友平台在21世纪初进入中国后，这种控制权更多地落到了个人手中。许多人渴望这种变化，他们聚集在流行的即时通讯应用微信平台上，使用平台让他们与陌生人聊天的功能。
"The trend accelerated in the 2010s with the arrival of dating apps like Momo and Tantan, which emulated Tinder. Alongside Soul, they became China's three most popular dating apps, amassing over 150 million monthly active users in total.",2010年代，随着陌陌、探探等模仿Tinder的约会应用出现，这个趋势加快了。陌陌、探探和Soul一起成了中国最受欢迎的三款约会应用，三者加起来的月活跃用户数已超过了1.5亿。
"Soul and Momo declined to comment. Tantan, which is owned by Momo, did not respond to a request for comment.",Soul和陌陌拒绝对本文置评。陌陌旗下的探探也没有回复记者的置评请求。
"The apps themselves have changed. Tantan and Momo had long matched users based on their physical appearance, leading to accusations that the platforms cultivated a hookup culture. More recently, these apps have started using people's interests, hobbies and personalities as the basis for new social encounters.",约会应用本身也发生了变化。探探和陌陌曾在以前很长一段时间里根据用户的外表来匹配他们，导致了人们批评这两个平台培植一种勾搭文化。最近，这些软件开始以人们的兴趣、爱好和性格作为建立新社交的基础。
"Douyin, which is owned by ByteDance and is China's version of TikTok, and Little Red Book, an app with similarities to Instagram, have built ""social discovery"" features that use their knowledge of people's preferences to match them. Soul has become especially popular in the past few years for its avatar profiles and its practice of linking users based on personality tests. Last year, the app surpassed Tantan and Momo as the most downloaded dating app on the Chinese iOS store.","字节跳动旗下的抖音以及与Instagram类似的应用小红书都带有""社交发现""功能，这个功能通过平台对用户嗜好的了解来匹配他们。Soul已在过去几年里变得特别受欢迎，因为它有带头像的用户简介、以及基于性格测试结果匹配用户的功能。去年，Soul已成为中国的苹果手机应用商店下载量最高超的约会应用，超过了探探和陌陌。"
"""What I like most about Soul is that it doesn't force you to look at a photo and swipe left and right,"" said Yang Zhongluo, 23, a masters student in Beijing who met some of her close friends on the platform. ""It lets you post, share ideas and then everyone can like and comment.""","""我最喜欢Soul的是，它不会一来就让你看照片然后左滑右滑，""在北京读研究生的23岁的杨卓珞(音)说。她在这个平台上认识了一些好友。""你可以在上面发一些post，分享一些想法，然后大家可以点赞评论。"""
"In July, Soul filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong after tripling its monthly active users to 31 million between 2019 and 2021. Three-quarters of its users were born between 1990 and 2009, according to its prospectus. (It filed to go public in the United States in 2021, but stepped back from such an offering.)",Soul的月活跃用户数从2019年到2021年增加了两倍，达到了3100万。今年7月，Soul在香港提交了首次公开募股申请。据其招股书，平台四分之三的用户出生在1990年至2009年之间。(公司曾在2021年申请在美国上市，但后来放弃了这个计划。)
"Many users of these dating apps appear less interested in romance than in meeting friends. In an October survey conducted by a Chinese research institute, 89 percent of respondents said they had used a dating app before, with a majority saying they wanted primarily to expand their social circles, not find a partner.",这些约会应用的许多用户似乎对结识朋友更感兴趣，而不是爱情。在中国一家研究机构去年10月做的调查中，89%的受访者说他们使用过约会应用，其中大多数人表示，他们主要是想扩大社交圈子，而不是寻找伴侣。
"Vladimir Peters, a Shanghai-based developer who is working on his own dating app, said many younger Chinese now want the apps to provide a more holistic experience that blends entertainment and hobby exploration not just a love match.",家住上海的软件开发者弗拉基米尔·彼得斯正在开发自己的约会应用。他说，许多中国年轻人现在希望这些应用能提供一种更全面的体验，将娱乐和探索爱好结合在一起，而不只是找对象。
"""Young Chinese like gimmicks such as icebreakers and other playful things that are the starting points for communication,"" he said.","""中国年轻人喜欢活跃气氛的游戏，以及其他可作为交流起点的好玩的东西，""彼得斯说。"
"Many of the biggest Chinese tech companies that make social networking and dating apps appear to have reached the same conclusion. Tencent, the owner of WeChat, has released 10 apps in the social networking and dating category in the past few years. It is developing a virtual party game in which users can simulate the experience of social gatherings without going to one.",许多制作社交平台和约会应用的中国大型技术公司看来也得出了同样的结论。微信的所有者腾讯已在过去几年里发布了10款社交网络和约会类的应用。腾讯正在开发一款多人游戏的社交产品，用户可以在游戏中模拟聚会的体验，无需参加实际聚会。
"NetEase, a gaming company, has also built a dating app that recommends matches based on people's shared interests. In March, ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, acquired PoliQ, a start-up that uses virtual reality to enhance social networking.",游戏公司网易也开发了一款约会应用，根据人们的共同兴趣推荐对象。今年3月，抖音的所有者字节跳动收购了波粒子，这是一家使用虚拟现实增强网络社交的初创公司。
"During the Shanghai lockdowns in April, Ms. Qu, who had long prized offline encounters and physical facial features on dating apps, said she began to cherish her matches more as digital companions.",屈童舟曾经非常看重线下见面，在约会应用里也很看重对方的长相，但她说，在今年4月上海封控期间，她开始更珍惜约会应用为她找到的匹配者，把他们视为数码社会里的陪伴。

"Over the last two decades, China has built the world's largest deep-water fishing fleet, by far, with nearly 3,000 ships. Having severely depleted stocks in its own coastal waters, China now fishes in any ocean in the world, and on a scale that dwarfs some countries' entire fleets near their own waters.",过去20年里，中国建立了世界上最大的深海捕鱼船队，拥有近3000艘船，远远多于其它国家。在本国沿海水域的渔业资源严重枯竭之后，目前中国在世界上任何海域都展开了捕鱼作业，其规模让一些国家在本国水域附近的整个船队都相形见绌。
"The impact is increasingly being felt from the Indian Ocean to the South Pacific, from the coasts of Africa to those off South America a manifestation on the high seas of China's global economic might.",从印度洋到南太平洋，从非洲海岸到南美海岸，人们越来越多地感受到这种影响——这是中国全球经济实力在公海上的体现。
"The Chinese effort has prompted diplomatic and legal protests. The fleet has also been linked to illegal activity, including encroaching on other countries' territorial waters, tolerating labor abuses and catching endangered species. In 2017, Ecuador seized a refrigerated cargo ship, the Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999, carrying an illicit cargo of 6,620 sharks, whose fins are a delicacy in China.","中国的行动引发了外交和法律抗议。这些船还与非法活动有关，包括侵入他国领海、纵容劳工虐待和濒危物种捕捞。2017年，厄瓜多尔没收了一艘冷藏货船""福远渔冷999""号，船上非法装载了6620条鲨鱼，鱼翅在中国是一种美味佳肴。"
"Much of what China does, however, is legal or, on the open seas at least, largely unregulated. Given the growing demands of an increasingly prosperous consumer class in China, it is unlikely to end soon. That doesn't mean it is sustainable.",然而，中国所做的大部分事情都是合法的——或者，至少在公海上，基本上是不受监管的。考虑到中国日益富裕的消费阶层日益增长的需求，这种局面不太可能很快结束。但这并不意味着它是可持续的。
"In the summer of 2020, the conservation group Oceana counted nearly 300 Chinese ships operating near the Galapagos, just outside Ecuador's exclusive economic zone, the 200 nautical miles off its territory where it maintains rights to natural resources under the Law of the Sea Treaty. The ships hugged the zone so tightly that satellite mapping of their positions traced the zone's boundary.",2020年夏天，据环保组织Oceana统计，有近300艘中国船只在加拉帕戈斯附近作业，加拉帕戈斯位于厄瓜多尔专属经济区之外，也就是厄瓜多尔根据《海洋法条约》享有自然资源权利的200海里之外。这些船只紧紧地包围着该区域，以至于用卫星测绘出它们的位置，可以勾勒出专属经济区的边界。
"Together, they accounted for nearly 99 percent of the fishing near the Galapagos. No other country came close.",它们加在一起，几乎占据了加拉帕戈斯附近捕捞量的近99%。没有哪个国家能够相提并论。
"""Our sea can't handle this pressure anymore,"" said Alberto Andrade, a fisherman from the Galapagos. The presence of so many Chinese vessels, he added, has made it harder for local fishermen inside Ecuador's territorial waters, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.","加拉帕戈斯的渔民阿尔贝托·安德拉德说:""我们的海洋再也无法承受这种压力了。""他还说，这么多中国船只的出现，使厄瓜多尔领海内的当地渔民生活更加艰难，这片领海是联合国教科文组织的世界遗产，曾启发了达尔文的进化论。"
"Mr. Andrade has organized a group of fishermen, the Island Front for the Galapagos Marine Reserve, to call for the expansion of fishery protections around the islands.","安德拉德组织了渔民团体""加拉帕戈斯海洋保护区岛屿阵线""，呼吁扩大对岛屿周围渔业的保护。"
"""The industrial fleets are razing the stocks, and we are afraid that in the future there will be no more fishery,"" he said. ""Not even the pandemic stopped them.""","""工业船队正在掠夺鱼群，我们担心未来将不再有渔业，""他说。""就连大流行也没能阻止他们。"""
An Industrial Effort,一场工业化行动
"China can fish on such an industrial scale because of vessels like Hai Feng 718, a refrigerated cargo ship built in Japan in 1996. It is registered in Panama and managed by a company in Beijing called Zhongyu Global Seafood Corporation.",中国能够以这样的工业化规模捕鱼，是因为有了像海丰718这样的船只，这是一艘1996年在日本建造的冷藏货船。它在巴拿马注册，由北京的中渔环球海洋食品公司管理。
Its owner is a state-owned enterprise: the China National Fisheries Corporation.,该公司的所有者是一家国有企业:中国水产有限公司。
"Hai Feng 718 is known as a carrier vessel, or mothership. It has refrigerated storage holds to preserve tons of catch. It also carries fuel and other supplies for smaller ships that can unload their hauls and resupply their crews at sea. As a result, the other vessels do not need to spend time returning to port, allowing them to fish almost continuously.",海丰718被称为运载船或母船。它有冷藏的储藏舱来保存成吨的渔获。它还可以为较小的船只运载燃料和其它补给，让它们可以卸下渔获，让船员获得补给。这样一来，其它船只就不需要花时间返回港口，从而可以几乎无间断地捕鱼。
"Over the course of a year beginning June 2021, the Hai Feng 718 met at least 70 smaller Chinese-flagged fishing vessels in various locations at sea, according to Global Fishing Watch, a research organization that assembles location data from ship transponders. Each encounter, known as a transshipment, represents the transfer of tons of fish that the smaller ships would have had to unload in port hundreds of miles away.","根据收集船舶应答器位置数据的研究机构全球渔业观察的统计，从2021年6月开始的一年时间里，海丰718在海上不同地点与至少70艘悬挂中国国旗的小型渔船对接。每一次——即所谓""海上转运""——都会转移数吨渔获，如果没有这样的转运，这些小型船只就必须在数百公里外的港口卸货。"
Together the vessels followed the coasts of South America in what has become a year-round pursuit of catch.,这些船只一起沿着南美洲海岸进行了长达一年的捕捞活动。
"After leaving Weihai, a port town in China's Shandong Province, the Hai Feng 718 arrived in the Galapagos in August 2021 and spent nearly a month in the waters off Ecuador's exclusive economic zone. There it serviced numerous ships like the Hebei 8588.",从中国山东省港口城市威海出发的海丰718于2021年8月抵达加拉帕戈斯，在厄瓜多尔专属经济区附近的海域停留了近一个月。在那里，它为许多像河北8588这样的船只提供服务。
"Such vessels are designed for catching squid, one of the prizes for the fleet. The lights the ships use at night to lure squid to the surface are so bright they can be tracked from space.",这种船是为捕捞船队格外青睐的鱿鱼而设计的。船只在夜间用来引诱鱿鱼浮出水面的灯光非常明亮，从太空都能追踪到。
"A month later, the Chinese fleet traveled to the coast of Peru, where the Hai Feng 718 sidled up to more than two dozen smaller vessels, some of them multiple times, including, again, the Hebei 8588.",一个月后，中国船队前往秘鲁海岸，在那里，海丰718与20多艘较小的船只擦肩而过，其中一些船多次靠近，包括河北8588号。
"Loaded with catch, the mothership returned to China. By last December, it was at sea again, this time heading west through the Indian Ocean. It arrived off the coast of Argentina for the start of the squid season there in January. In May, it was once again off the coast of the Galapagos.",母船满载着渔获返回中国。到去年12月，它又出海了，这次是向西穿过印度洋。今年1月，它抵达阿根廷海岸，迎接那里鱿鱼季的开始。今年5月，它再次出现在加拉帕戈斯海岸。
"These operations have allowed a boom in the squid harvest. Between 1990 and 2019, the number of deep-water squid boats soared from six to 528, while the annual reported catch rose from about 5,000 tons to 278,000, according to a report this year by Global Fishing Watch. In 2019, China accounted for nearly all the squid boats operating in the South Pacific.",这些操作使得鱿鱼的收获大幅增加。根据全球渔业观察今年的一份报告，在1990年至2019年期间，深水鱿鱼船的数量从6艘飙升至528艘，而每年报告的渔获量从约5000吨上升至27.8万吨。2019年，在南太平洋作业的鱿鱼船几乎全部来自中国。
"The arrangement of transferring catch to another vessel is not illegal, but according to experts, the use of the motherships makes it easy to underreport the catch and disguise its origins. Other places also deploy deep-water fleets, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, but none do so on the scale of China.",将渔获物转移到另一艘船上的安排并不违法，但专家表示，使用母船很容易少报渔获并掩盖其来源。包括日本、韩国和台湾在内的其他地方也部署了深水舰队，但都没有达到中国这样的规模。
"The Hai Feng 718 alone has more than 500,000 cubic feet of cargo space, enough to carry thousands of tons of fish.",仅海丰718的载货空间就超过1.4万立方米，足以装载数千吨鱼。
"Global Fishing Watch has tracked scores of unexplained ""loitering events,"" where larger ships linger in one area without any recorded meetings between the carriers and smaller ships. Experts warn that the smaller ships may be turning off their transponders to avoid detection to disguise illegal or unregulated catch.","全球渔业观察已经追踪了数十起原因不明的""游荡事件""，即大型船只在一个区域徘徊，但没有任何记录显示母船与小型船只之间的会面。专家警告说，较小的船只可能会关闭应答器，以避免被发现，从而掩盖非法或不受监管的捕捞。"
"The impact on certain species like squid off the coast of South America is difficult to measure exactly. In some regions, like the South Pacific, international agreements require countries to report their haul, though underreporting is believed to be common. In the South Atlantic, there is no such agreement.",这些行为对某些物种的影响很难精确衡量，比如南美洲海岸的鱿鱼。在南太平洋等地区，国际协议要求各国报告其捕捞量，尽管少报被认为是普遍现象。在南大西洋没有这样的协议。
"There are already worrisome signs of diminishing stocks, which could foreshadow a broader ecological collapse.",已经有令人担忧的迹象显示，鱿鱼的种群数量正在减少，这可能预示着更大范围的生态崩溃。
"""The concern is the sheer number of ships and the lack of accountability, to know how much is being fished out and where it's going to,"" said Marla Valentine, an oceanographer with Oceana, the conservation group. ""And I'm worried that the impacts that are happening now are going to cascade into the future.","""令人担忧的是船只数量之大，而且缺乏问责，无从了解捕捞数量，以及它们的去向，""保护组织Oceana的海洋学家玛拉·瓦伦丁说。""而且我担心，现在正在发生的影响会延伸到未来。"
"""Because it's not just the squid that are going to be affected,"" she added. ""It's going to be everything that feeds on the squid, too.""","""因为受影响的不仅仅是鱿鱼，""她补充道。""一切以鱿鱼为食的生物都会受到波及。"""
The Global Backlash,全球反弹
"The appearance of the Chinese fleet on the edge of the Galapagos in 2020 focused international attention on the industrial scale of China's fishing fleet. Ecuador lodged a protest in Beijing. Its president at the time, Lenin Moreno, vowed on Twitter to defend the marine sanctuary, which he called ""a seedbed of life for the entire planet.""","2020年，中国的渔船出现在了加拉帕戈斯群岛的边缘，这让国际社会开始留意中国渔船船队的庞大规模。厄瓜多尔在北京提出抗议。时任总统莱宁·莫雷诺在Twitter上放话，要捍卫这个海洋保护区，他称其为""整个地球生命的苗床""。"
"China has responded with offers of concessions. It announced moratoriums on fishing in certain areas, though critics noted that the restrictions apply to seasons when the fish are not as abundant. It vowed to cap the size of its deep-water fleet, though not to reduce it, and to trim the government subsidies it provides fishing companies, many still state-owned or controlled.",作为回应，中国提出了让步。它宣布在某些地区暂停捕鱼，但批评人士指出，这些限制只用于鱼类不是那么丰富的季节。它还承诺限制深水船队的规模，但不会减少，并削减对渔业公司的补贴，其中不少公司依旧是国有或者国家控股。
"In the year that followed the furor over the Galapagos, the bulk of the Chinese fleet kept a greater distance from Ecuador's exclusive economic zone. Otherwise it continued to fish as much as before.",在加拉帕戈斯群岛捕鱼引发愤怒之后的一年里，大部分中国舰队与厄瓜多尔的专属经济区保持了更远的距离。除此之外，捕鱼的规模并无缩减。
"In Argentina, a group of environmentalists, supported by the Gallifrey Foundation, an ocean conservation organization, filed an injunction with the country's top court last year in the hope of prodding the government to do more to comply with its constitutional obligations to protect the environment. They plan to submit a similar injunction in the coming months in Ecuador.",在阿根廷，一群环保主义者在海洋保护组织加里弗雷基金会的支持下，在去年向该国最高法院申请禁制令，希望促使政府采取更多措施来履行其保护环境的宪法义务。他们计划未来几个月在厄瓜多尔也提交类似的申请。
"""We have a permanent Chinese fleet 200 miles off our coast,"" said Pablo Ferrara, a lawyer and professor at the University of Salvador in Buenos Aires, referring to the distance covered by Argentina's exclusive economic zone.","""在距离我们海岸200英里(约合320公里)的地方，有一支常驻的中国船队，""布宜诺斯艾利斯萨尔瓦多大学教授、律师巴勃罗·费拉拉说，他提及的这个距离在阿根廷的专属经济区范围之内。"
"Argentina's navy, which sank a Chinese fishing boat inside the zone in 2016, has since announced it would add four new patrol ships to step up its enforcement efforts in its coastal waters.",阿根廷海军于2016年在该区域内击沉了一艘中国渔船，此后宣布增派四艘新巡逻舰，以加强在沿海水域的执法。
"The United States, too, has pledged to assist smaller nations to counter China's illegal or unregulated fishing practices. The U.S. Coast Guard, which now calls the practice one of the greatest security threats in the oceans, has dispatched patrol ships to the South Pacific.",美国也承诺帮助较小的国家对抗中国的非法或不受管制的捕鱼行为。美国海岸警卫队现在称这种行为是海洋中最大的安全威胁之一，并且向南太平洋派遣了巡逻船。
"In July, President Biden issued a national security memorandum pledging to increase monitoring of the industry. Speaking virtually at a forum of Pacific nations that month, Vice President Kamala Harris said the United States would triple American assistance to help the nations patrol their waters, offering $60 million a year for the next decade.",7月，拜登总统签署了一份国家安全备忘录，承诺加强对渔业的监管。副总统哈里斯同月在一个太平洋国家论坛上发表视频讲话时表示，美国将把援助增加两倍，帮助这些国家在它们的海域巡逻，同时在未来十年每年提供6000万美元。
"Such efforts may help in territorial waters, but they do little to restrict China's fleet on the open seas. The consumption of fish worldwide continues to rise, reaching a record high in 2019. At the same time, the known stocks of most species of fish continue to decline, according to the latest report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.",这些努力可能在领海上有所帮助，但无法在公海上限制中国的捕捞船队。全球鱼类消费量持续上升，2019年达到历史新高。与此同时，根据联合国粮农组织的最新报告，大多数鱼类的种群数量都在持续下降。
"""The challenge is to persuade China that it, too, has a need to ensure the long-range sustainability of the ocean's resources,"" said Duncan Currie, an international environmental lawyer who advises the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. ""It's not going to be there forever.""","""挑战在于说服中国，它也需要确保海洋资源的长期可持续性，""为深海保护联盟提供建议的国际环境律师邓肯·库里说。""海洋资源不是取之不竭的。"""
"After a bus accident killed at least 27 people being transferred to a Covid quarantine facility on Sunday, the Chinese public staged a widespread online protest against the government's harsh pandemic policy.",上周日，一辆转运隔离人员的大巴车发生车祸，导致至少27人死亡后，中国公众在网上针对政府严厉的防疫政策进行了广泛抗议。
"It was a moment of collective grief and anger, with a heavy dose of shame, guilt and despair. After nearly three years of constant lockdowns, mass testing and quarantines, people asked how they could give the government the power to deprive them of their dignity, livelihood, mental health and even life; how they could fail to protect their loved ones from the ""zero Covid"" autocracy; and how long the craziness would last.","这是一个共同悲伤和愤怒的时刻，伴随着沉重的羞耻、内疚和绝望。经历了近三年的不断封控、大规模检测和集中隔离后，人们想知道他们怎么能赋予政府剥夺自己尊严、生计、心理健康甚至生命的权力;为什么无法保护亲人免受""新冠清零""专政之害;以及，这种疯狂还会持续多久。"
"They quoted a 1940 poem by Bertolt Brecht, the German poet and playwright.",人们引用了德国诗人兼剧作家贝托尔特·布莱希特1940年发表的一首诗。

"They asked themselves, ""What can I do so I will not end up on that bus?""","他们扪心自问:""我们要怎么做，才能不上那辆大巴车?"""
"For them, they could have easily been the 27 people forced to board the bus. The bus itself was a symbol of their collective ""zero Covid"" destiny: the country's 1.4 billion people heading to an unknown destination. They felt they have lost control of their lives as the government pursues its policy relentlessly, even as the virus has become much milder and much of the world is eager to declare the end of the pandemic.","对他们来说，很容易就会成为被迫坐上那辆大巴的27个人。那辆大巴本身就是他们在""新冠清零""政策下集体归宿的象征:全国14亿人正在走向一个未知的目的地。他们觉得，随着政府残酷地坚持清零政策，自己已经失去了对生活的控制，尽管病毒的毒性已经大为减弱，而且世界上许多地方都急着要宣布新冠病毒大流行的结束。"
"""We're on that bus, too"" has been one of the most shared comments since the crash.","""我们也在那辆大巴上""是事故发生后最常见的评论之一。"
"The bus was transporting 47 people from the southwestern city of Guiyang when it rolled over in the early hours of Sunday, according to the local authorities. Along with the 27 people killed, the rest onboard were injured.",地方政府称，那辆大巴上周日凌晨发生侧翻时，正在将47人从西南城市贵阳转运到外地。车上除27人死亡外，还有20人受伤。
"The government of Guiyang, the capital of the Guizhou Province, hasn't released any information about the identity of the victims, saying only that the passengers were ""pandemic-related"" residents from the same district. It could mean that they were from areas where cases were detected, but it doesn't necessarily mean they had the virus. According to Caixin magazine, a respected news organization, most of the passengers were residents of the same residential compound.","贵州省会贵阳市的政府没有公布遇难者的身份信息，只说他们是居住在同一个城区的""涉疫人员""。这可能是指他们来自发现了确诊病例的城区，但并不一定意味着他们感染了病毒。据受人尊敬的新闻媒体《财新》报道，车上大多数人都是同一个小区的居民。"
"Much of Guiyang had been under lockdown since earlier this month after several hundred Covid cases were detected. A local official said on Saturday that the city was running out of quarantine rooms and had transported more than 7,000 people to facilities in other parts of the province. Another 3,000 were in the process of being transferred. He admitted complaints about the long-distance transfers.",自从本月早些时候累计通报了几百例确诊病例后，贵阳的大部分地区一直处于封控状态。当地一名官员曾在上周六说，贵阳市内的集中隔离设施已满员，该市已将7000多人转运到贵州省其他地方集中隔离。另有3000人正在转运过程中。他承认人们对长途转运存在不满。
"Angry social media users criticized the government, which on Friday had outlined a goal to achieve zero new cases within days. People questioned the rationale of centralized quarantines, late-night transfers and other aspects of the Covid policy. On Monday, the city lifted the lockdown in many districts.",愤怒的社交媒体用户批评贵阳市政府，它曾在上周五提出在几天内实现清零目标。人们对集中隔离、深夜转运以及防疫政策其他方面的合理性提出了怀疑。贵阳市已在周一解除了多个城区的封控。

"The tragedy also triggered soul-searching about how the Chinese public could let it happen. Some people admitted that they were ashamed they haven't stood up to the ""zero Covid"" policy.","车祸的悲剧也引发了人们对中国公众怎么会允许这种事情发生的反省。一些人承认，他们对自己没能站出来抵制""清零""政策感到羞耻。"

"BEIJING A bus that was carrying dozens of people to a quarantine facility crashed over the weekend in southwestern China, killing at least 27 of them and setting off a renewed, anguished debate about the country's zero-tolerance Covid policies.",北京——上周末，中国西南地区一辆将几十人运往集中隔离设施的大巴车发生翻车事故，导致至少27人死亡，再次引发了有关中国新冠病毒零容忍政策的痛苦辩论。
"The bus was transporting 47 people from the city of Guiyang when it rolled over around 2:40 a.m. on Sunday, about 100 miles southeast of the city, according to the local authorities. In addition to the 27 people killed, the 20 other passengers onboard were injured.",当地政府表示，这辆载有47人的大巴车于周日凌晨2点40分左右在贵阳东南约160公里处翻车。车上除27人死亡外，还有20人受伤。
"Much of Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, has been under lockdown since earlier this month, after several hundred coronavirus infections were detected there. Under China's ""zero Covid"" policies, just a handful of cases is enough to trigger mass quarantines and testing an approach that has increasingly worn on many Chinese, as the rest of the world moves toward living with the virus.","贵州省会贵阳的大部分居民自本月初以来一直处于封控管理之下，因为那里已确诊了几百例新冠病毒感染病例。按照中国""清零""政策的要求，只要出现零星感染病例，就会导致大规模的病毒检测和集中隔离，随着世界其他地区的人开始与新冠病毒共存，中国的做法已让国内越来越多的人感到厌烦。"
"On Saturday, the day before the crash, the Guiyang authorities said that they were sending people to other cities to be quarantined, because there were too many of them for the facilities in Guiyang to accommodate.",上周六，也就是翻车事故发生的前一天，贵阳有关部门表示，由于贵阳的隔离设施容纳不下这么多人，正在进行大规模异地转运。
"After the crash, officials did not say why the people on the bus were being quarantined, such as whether they had tested positive for the virus or were contacts of people who had; they said only that the passengers were ""epidemic-related.""","翻车事故发生后，官员们没有说明为什么要对车上的人进行隔离，比如他们的病毒检测呈阳性，或他们是密切接触者;官员只说车上载有""涉疫人员""。"
"As news of the crash emerged, Chinese social media erupted with fierce debate about whether the country's Covid policies were to blame. Users asked whether the passengers had needed to be transferred at all and why the bus had been on the road so late at night, when Chinese traffic laws prohibit most long-distance passenger vehicles from driving between 2 and 5 a.m. Some said that such a tragedy could have happened to anyone, given the government's fixation on eliminating cases and ordinary people's powerlessness to resist it.","随着车祸消息传出，中国社交媒体上爆发了有关事故责任是否在于""清零""政策的激烈辩论。网民们质疑车上的人是否都需要转运，为什么大巴车凌晨时间还在路上，因为中国的交通法规禁止大多数长途客运车辆在凌晨2点至5点之间行驶。有人说，这个悲剧可能发生在任何人身上，因为政府固执地坚持清除感染病例，老百姓无力抵抗这种做法。"
"And many raised a question that has become a familiar one in China, as lockdowns across the country have led to food and medical shortages, separation of parents from children and mental health crises: Was there any price for ""zero Covid"" that the government would consider too high? (Guizhou Province has recorded only two deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic began.)","随着全国各地的封控导致食品和药品短缺、父母与孩子分离以及精神健康出现危机，许多人提出了一个中国人已经熟悉的问题:""新冠清零""的代价高到什么程度政府才会认为太高?(贵州全省自新冠病毒大流行开始以来只通报了两例新冠病毒死亡病例。)"
"Nie Riming, a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Finance and Law, wrote in a widely shared online article that the crash was ""not an isolated incident.""","上海金融与法律研究院研究员聂日明发文写道，""贵阳转运客车侧翻事故不是孤案""，这篇文章在网上被广泛转发。"

"Censors removed many angry comments about the crash, as well as the entire accounts of some users who had shared their outrage or grief. In a reflection of how polarizing and politicized the Covid debate in China has become, some social media users struck back at the critics, saying that people who would turn a traffic accident into a political debate must be servants of Western forces.",审查人员删除了许多有关翻车事故的愤怒评论，封了一些分享自己的愤怒或悲伤的网民的账号。也有社交媒体用户对批评者进行反击，称那些把交通事故变成政治事件的人肯定是西方势力的帮凶，反映了中国有关新冠病毒的辩论已变得多么两极化和政治化。
"The Chinese authorities have long been wary of large outpourings of public grief, which have often involved cries for accountability and shaken people's trust in the government. But officials are on particularly high alert now, with a major Chinese Communist Party congress due next month, at which China's leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to claim an unprecedented third term.",长期以来，中国当局一直对公众悲伤情绪的大规模宣泄保持警惕，因为这往往伴有要求问责的呼声，动摇人们对政府的信任。但官员们现在尤其处于高度戒备状态，因为中共将在下月召开二十大，预计中国领导人习近平将在会上获得前所未有的第三个任期。
"Local governments have been under intense pressure to contain any outbreaks before that meeting, given Mr. Xi's personal emphasis on the importance of ""zero Covid."" Guizhou had pledged to essentially eliminate cases by Monday.","由于习近平本人一直在强调""新冠清零""的重要性，地方政府在二十大召开之前面临着遏制疫情暴发的巨大压力。贵州曾承诺在本周一前基本上实现清零。"
"At a news conference on Sunday night, Guiyang's deputy mayor said officials were ""incomparably remorseful"" about the crash and ""sincerely apologized to the entire society."" The authorities in Guizhou Province promised an investigation. But officials have not given a reason for the crash or whether any traffic laws were violated.","贵阳副市长在周日晚间的新闻发布会上表示，官员们对翻车事故""无比自责""，并""向全社会作出诚恳道歉""。贵州省当局已承诺对事故进行调查。但官员们没有给出事故原因，也没有说是否违反了交通法规。"
"Many social media users dismissed the apology as hollow. ""Can an apology replace the law?"" He Guangwei, a well-known journalist, wrote on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform.","许多社交媒体用户把政府的道歉称为空洞。""道歉能取代法律吗?""知名记者何光伟在中国社交媒体平台微博上写道。"
"Guizhou's lockdown had been riddled by problems even before the crash. The government was forced to apologize on Sept. 8, shortly after the city shut down, after many residents reported food shortages. Officials said Covid restrictions had caused a shortage of delivery workers.",在翻车事故发生之前，贵州的封控就已经问题百出。在贵阳封城后不久的9月8日，政府就因许多民众报告食物短缺问题被迫道歉。官员称，遏制新冠病毒的措施导致了快递员短缺。
"Residents had also complained of unsanitary or shoddy conditions at quarantine facilities, leading the local government to acknowledge that conditions were ""uneven."" The Chinese authorities have refused to allow home quarantine.","民众还抱怨集中隔离设施不卫生或条件差，导致当地政府承认""条件参差不齐""。中国当局一直拒绝让人居家隔离。"
"Late last week, the city's Communist Party secretary, Hu Zhongxiong, called for residents to be sent to quarantine more quickly, urging same-day transfers. By Saturday afternoon, more than 7,000 people had been sent out of Guiyang, with nearly 3,000 more in the process of being transferred, officials said.","上周晚些时候，贵阳市市委书记胡忠雄要求更快地将居民转运到隔离设施，要求""日清日结""。官员说，截至上周六下午，已将7000多人转运出贵阳，另有近3000人正在转运过程中。"
"Hours later, at 10 minutes after midnight, the bus departed from Guiyang.",几小时后，那辆大巴于午夜10分从贵阳出发了。
"BEIJING Infected patients quarantined alongside those who tested negative. No food for hours, despite repeated requests. Lines of buses, loaded with people, waiting late into the night to drop them off at makeshift isolation centers.",北京——感染病毒的患者与检测呈阴性的人一起隔离。尽管多次提出请求，数个小时也没有吃的。一排排满载的巴士在深夜排起长队，等待将这些人送进临时隔离中心。
"These are the scenes described by residents of Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, who have been locked down for one month as officials try to contain a coronavirus outbreak.",这些是西藏首府拉萨的居民描述的场景，由于官员们试图控制疫情暴发，他们已经被封锁了一个月。
"Lockdowns, including of entire cities, have become almost commonplace in China, which remains bent on eliminating the coronavirus even as the rest of the world tries to live with it. But the recent calls for help out of Tibet, as well as Xinjiang two border regions where the Chinese government has put in place highly repressive controls speak to how desperate conditions have become there, where many residents are usually intimidated into keeping quiet.",在中国，封锁——包括整个城市范围的封锁——已经变成了几乎司空见惯的事情，虽然世界其他地方都试图与病毒共存，但中国仍然一心想要消灭新冠。在中国政府实施了高度压制性控制的两个边境地区——西藏和新疆，许多居民常常因被恐吓而不敢发声，但人们最近发出的求援呼声表明，那里的情况已经变得让人十分绝望。
"Yet the incentive for the authorities to hold fast and silence discontent is also stronger than usual. The Chinese Communist Party is slated to hold a major political meeting next month, where its leader, Xi Jinping, is almost certain to extend his tenure. In the run-up, it is crucial for officials to ensure that the effort to achieve ""zero Covid,"" which Mr. Xi has declared a personal priority, appears smooth and successful.","然而，当局坚持抗疫和压制不满的动力也比以往更为强烈。中国共产党定于下个月举行一次重要的政治会议，其领导人习近平几乎肯定会延长任期。习近平已将""清零""列为个人优先事项，在会议开幕之前，官员们必须确保""清零""工作看起来顺利而成功。"
"The result is a vicious cycle. The authorities enact ever-harsher quarantine and censorship rules. Those, in turn, create more hardships and dissatisfaction.",这样做的结果就是一场恶性循环。当局制定了越来越严格的隔离规定和审查规则。反过来，它们又造成了更多的困难和不满。
"""The social media posts you see from people in Lhasa are all about suffering, but that's the real Lhasa. Lhasa's public announcements, I feel they're all fake,"" said a food delivery worker in the city who gave only his surname, Min, for fear of official retaliation.","""你从拉萨人那里看到的社交媒体帖子都是关于苦难的，但这就是真实的拉萨。拉萨的公告，我觉得都是假的。""该市一名外卖员说道，由于害怕遭到政府的报复，他只透露自己姓闵。"
"The government has promoted positive videos of officials encouraging frontline workers and promising ample supplies of food and medicine. But Mr. Min said he was quarantined with five family members in an unfinished apartment building, even though he had not tested positive. Workers said he could be released if his latest test, on Sept. 10, also came back negative but it had been days with no word on a result.",在政府推广的正能量视频中，官员给一线工作人员打气，并承诺提供充足的食物和药品。但闵先生说，他和家里五个人都在一栋未完工的公寓里隔离，即使他的检测结果并非阳性。工作人员说，如果他在9月10日的最新检测结果也是阴性，他可能会解除隔离——但已经过去好几天，一直没有检测结果。
"While he was waiting, officials had sent another man to join their family in quarantine, because they were all of the Hui ethnic minority, Mr. Min said. But the man said he had tested positive. Mr. Min said all he could do was wear two masks and try to keep a distance.",闵先生说，在等待期间，官员安排另一名男子和他们一家一起隔离，因为大家都是回族。但该男子说他的检测结果呈阳性。闵先生说，他能做的只有戴上两个口罩，尽量保持距离。
"Restrictions are tightening across China. Last week, the central government announced that the entire country, even areas without cases, would need to mandate regular testing of all residents through October. Tens of millions of people have been locked down in recent weeks. The capital, Beijing, is on high alert, after several dozen cases have been detected in recent days.",中国各地的防疫措施都在收紧。上周，中央政府宣布，全国——即使是没有病例的地区——从现在开始到10月底都需要对所有居民进行常态化核酸检测。最近几周，数以千万计的人被封锁。首都北京在最近几天发现了数十起病例后处于高度戒备状态。
"The lockdowns in Tibet and Xinjiang, though, stand out for having dragged on for more than a month. Lhasa home to nearly 900,000 people, about 70 percent of them ethnically Tibetan began ordering certain areas to close after discovering a handful of infections on Aug. 8, with restrictions soon spreading citywide. Yining, a city in the northwestern part of Xinjiang, has also been under restrictions since early August.",然而，西藏和新疆的封锁因持续了一个多月而引人注目。拉萨的人口近90万，其中约70%是藏族人。在8月8日发现少数确诊病例后，拉萨开始下令封锁部分地区，接着防疫措施很快扩大到全市。位于新疆西北部的伊宁市自8月初以来也一直处于封城状态。
"The shutdowns gained relatively little attention at first, compared with those in larger cities like Shanghai and Chengdu, whose lockdowns this year dominated Chinese social media. But in recent days, as the controls have shown no sign of easing, residents have mounted an online campaign to draw attention to their plight. Some have tagged state media outlets in hopes of attracting official coverage. Others have attached unrelated trending hashtags, such as one about an actor accused of hiring prostitutes.",今年上海和成都等大城市的封城占据了中国社交媒体的主要位置，相比之下，这些城市的封锁最初没有得到多少关注。但最近几天，由于防控措施没有放松的迹象，居民们发起一场网络运动，希望引起人们关注他们的困境。一些人还抄送给官方媒体账号，希望能吸引官方媒体的报道。还有人借助不相关的热搜标签，例如一个演员被指控嫖娼的热搜。
"Perhaps most remarkably, the chorus of voices has also included ethnic Tibetans a group that can face intense repercussions for any criticism of the government. Under Mr. Xi, the authorities in Tibet a part of China known officially as the Tibetan Autonomous Region have stepped up longstanding efforts to assimilate ethnic Tibetans through resettlement programs, political indoctrination and a crackdown on their language.",或许最引人注目的是，群体声音中还包括藏族——这一群体对政府的任何批评都可能招致严重后果。中国称西藏是中国的一部分，其官方名称为西藏自治区，在习近平的领导下，当局通过重新安置项目、政治灌输和压制藏语，加大了长期同化藏族人的努力。
"On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, some residents have shared videos in Tibetan describing being unable to work or pay rent, according to translations by Tibet Action Institute, an overseas activist group supporting Tibetan independence. One man, filming himself in a vehicle, said he had been sleeping in his car for a month. A woman begged to be allowed to return to her village elsewhere in Tibet, describing her worry about food running out.","一些居民在抖音上分享了藏语视频，根据支持西藏独立的海外活动组织""西藏行动中心""的翻译，居民们在视频中表示无法工作或支付房租。一名男子在车里对着手机拍摄，说他已经在车里睡了一个月了。一名女子担心她的食物即将耗尽，恳求被允许返回位于西藏另一个地方的村庄。"
"Lhadon Tethong, the director of Tibet Action Institute, said she had been stunned by what she called a flood of Tibetan voices this week, compared with a trickle of information before.",西藏行动中心主任拉顿德通说，本周西藏人的声音如潮水般涌来令她震惊，之前只有寥寥无几的信息。

"Several of the videos have been deleted. In the video of the woman asking to go home no longer available online she emphasized that she was not protesting. On Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, a user whose post about Lhasa's lockdown was shared more than 6,000 times later posted again thanking users for commenting on government accounts to raise awareness but asked them to stop tagging her.

They were beaten, she said, providing photos of their injuries.",温燕说，他们没有吃的;一名工作人员说他们来得太晚。午夜时分，她的男友和另一名男子因索要食物与一些工作人员发生冲突。她说他们遭到了殴打，并提供了他们受伤的照片。
"Ms. Wen also shared her photos on Weibo, where they were shared thousands of times. The next day, an official at her quarantine facility asked her to delete them, but she refused.",温燕还在微博上分享了她的照片，它们被转发了数千次。第二天，她所在隔离机构的一名官员要求她删除照片，但她拒绝了。

Both contracted fevers this month.",生活在该市的哈利帕是两个孩子的母亲，她只肯透露自己的名字。她说，官员们最近几天送来了肉和馕，这是她三周以来第一次吃肉。但仍然无法购买水果，她担心缺乏营养会降低孩子们的抵抗力。两个孩子本月都发烧了。
The Yining government has said it is gradually reopening the city. But Halipa said there was no sign that the steel lock keeping residents inside her apartment building was going to be removed.,伊宁市政府表示，正在逐步重新开放这座城市。但哈利帕说，没有迹象表明她公寓大楼外锁住居民的钢锁会被拆除。

That meeting will give Mr. Putin, whose country has been increasingly isolated by the United States and Europe over its invasion of Ukraine and whose forces have faced sharp battlefield setbacks in recent days, a needed boost by standing alongside one of the world's most powerful leaders.",习近平已于周三抵达哈萨克斯坦，这是他三天行程的第一站。他的下一站是乌兹别克斯坦，他将在那里出席区域领导人峰会，并预计将与俄罗斯总统普京见面。通过与世界上权力最大的领导人之一站在一起，这将让普京得到所需的激励，他的国家由于入侵乌克兰正受到美国和欧洲越来越多的孤立，俄军最近几天在战场上也遭受严重挫折。
"Mr. Xi will seek to use the trip to shore up confidence in his grip on power weeks before a key meeting of the ruling Communist Party leadership, where he is expected to claim another five-year term.",习近平将寻求利用这次出访来加强国内对他控制权力的信心，执政的中共领导层将在几周后召开一个重要会议，预计习近平将在这次会议上获得作为领导人的又一个五年任期。
"Across its official propaganda apparatus, the party is promoting Mr. Xi's trip heavily at a time when the country faces grave challenges. China's economy has slowed drastically. Youth unemployment is at a record high. Rising inflation around the world has hurt demand for Chinese exports. The party is imposing extensive many say excessive lockdowns to try to curb Covid outbreaks, confining an estimated tens of millions of people to their homes and subjecting some residents to dire food shortages.",在国内面临严峻挑战之际，中共正在发动全部的官方宣传机器，大力宣传习近平的出访。中国的经济已急剧放缓。青年失业率创下历史新高。全球范围的通货膨胀损害了对中国出口产品的需求。为了试图遏制新冠病毒的暴发，中共仍在强制实行广泛的——许多人认为是过度的——封控措施，将数以千万计的人限制在家中，使一些居民面临严重的食物短缺。
"The country's stringent and single-minded focus on avoiding and eliminating the coronavirus at all costs also explains Mr. Xi's long absence from the global stage. Mr. Xi's last trip to a foreign country was to Myanmar in January 2020. Even when he ventured to the southern Chinese city of Hong Kong this July, he took few risks, requiring that all officials, journalists and others attending the events undergo daily coronavirus testing and isolate themselves before his arrival.",中国专注于采用严格措施，不惜一切代价遏制和消灭新冠病毒，这也解释了习近平在全球舞台上长期缺席的原因。习近平最近一次出访是2020年1月对缅甸的访问。即使在今年7月大胆前往中国南方城市香港的时候，他也没有冒多大风险，香港要求所有出席活动的官员、记者和其他人，在习近平到来之前进行自我隔离，并每天做新冠病毒检测。
"Mr. Xi's conspicuous retreat was a stark contrast to his schedule before the pandemic, when he spent the equivalent of more than a month abroad each year. In recent months, as more countries have opened up, it made him an outlier among the leaders of powerful countries. It also limited his ability to directly influence China's image abroad amid rising concerns about Beijing's human rights record, its saber-rattling against Taiwan and other issues.",习近平惹人注意的退避与他在新冠病毒大流行之前的日程安排形成了鲜明对比，那时，他每年加起来有一个多月的时间在国外访问。最近几个月，随着更多国家开放国门，他在大国领导人中愈发像是局外人。在国外对中国的人权记录、武力恫吓台湾和其他问题的担忧日益增长之际，这也限制了他直接影响中国海外形象的能力。
"""The only reason Xi Jinping did not go out over the past three years was the epidemic prevention and control policies,"" said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing. But staying home ""also brings some losses to China's diplomacy,"" he added.","""习近平三年没出国门的唯一原因是疫情防控政策，""北京的中国人民大学国际关系教授时殷弘说。但呆在家里""也给中国的外交带来了一些损失""，他补充说。"
"""Now the leaders of the Chinese government should start to cautiously and properly resume face-to-face exchanges and foreign visits with leaders of other countries,"" Mr. Shi said.","""现在，中国政府领导人应该开始谨慎地、适当地恢复与其他国家领导人面对面的交流和对外访问，""时殷弘说。"
"Even though Mr. Xi's and Mr. Putin's meeting will show the growing closeness of Beijing and Moscow, its setting will offer a reminder of the many ways in which they compete. In Central Asia, China has worked to expand its footprint in the former Soviet republics that Russia views as within its sphere of influence.",尽管习近平和普京会面将展示出北京与莫斯科日益密切的关系，但会面的场合也提醒人们，中俄两国在很多方面存在竞争。中国一直在中亚努力扩大自己的影响力，而俄罗斯则认为这些曾经的苏联加盟共和国属于其势力范围。
"In a pair of essays written before his trip for Kazakh and Uzbek media, Mr. Xi emphasized China's historical ties with the two countries and depicted Beijing as a generous benefactor and reliable regional power. He highlighted Chinese investment in pipelines, wind power, oil refining and auto manufacturing in Kazakhstan and the joint production of Chinese Covid vaccines in Uzbekistan.",习近平在出访前分别在哈萨克斯坦和乌兹别克斯坦的媒体上发文，他在文章中强调，中国与这两个国家有悠久的历史，并把中国政府描绘为一个慷慨的捐助者和可靠的区域大国。他特别强调了中国对哈萨克斯坦的油气管道、风电、炼油和汽车制造业的投资，还提到了与乌兹别克斯坦联合生产中国研发的新冠病毒疫苗。
"""Uzbekistan is welcome to board the express train of China's development and share its development opportunities,"" he wrote.","""欢迎乌方搭乘中国发展快车，共享发展机遇，""他写道。"
"Mr. Xi is sure to emphasize the potential of trade and investment with China. His first stop, Kazakhstan, has been key to China's vast international investment and development program known as the Belt and Road Initiative, which he started on a visit in 2013. The program, which centers on Chinese-led investment in bridges, rails, ports and energy to link dozens of countries to China, has been a signature project of Mr. Xi's, with ambitions of remaking the global economic order.","习近平肯定会强调与中国进行贸易和投资的潜力。他的第一站哈萨克斯坦是中国庞大的国际投资和发展计划""一带一路""倡议的关键，该倡议是习近平2013年访问中亚各国时提出的，核心是以中国投资为主导，修建桥梁、铁路、港口和能源设施，将几十个国家与中国联系起来，这一直是习近平的标志性项目，最终目标是重塑全球经济秩序。"
"But critics say the infrastructure and investment scheme leaves the participating nations dependent on China. Such concerns are shared by many in Kazakhstan, who worry that the country's economic reliance on China gives Beijing too much leverage.",但批评人士称，该倡议的基础设施和投资计划让参与国变得依赖中国。哈萨克斯坦有许多人也有这种担忧，他们担心自己的国家对中国的经济依赖会给予中国政府太多的影响力。
"The country's ethnic Kazakh majority shares linguistic, cultural and in some cases family ties with Kazakhs in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China. Beijing has imposed an expansive crackdown in Xinjiang that has led to the mass detentions of many members of predominately Muslim groups, including Kazakhs.",哈萨克人在该国人口中占多数，他们与中国西北新疆地区的哈萨克族有着共同的语言、文化和一些家庭关系。中国政府在新疆进行的大规模镇压，导致许多以穆斯林为主的少数民族成员关进了大型拘禁营，其中包括哈萨克族。
"The crackdown has created a sticking point in ties between the two countries, but the Kazakh leadership has not publicly criticized China for it, and the country's authorities have also punished activists seeking to lobby for those facing repression in China.",虽然这种镇压已在两国关系中制造了分歧点，但哈萨克斯坦的领导人并没有因此而公开批评中国，该国当局甚至还惩罚了试图为在中国面临镇压的少数民族进行游说的活动人士。
"A military band and top officials, including President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, greeted Mr. Xi at the airport in Kazakhstan's capital. Like Mr. Xi, the Kazakh officials were all masked, apparently in deference to China's strict efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Kazakh president has conducted other recent official business, including a meeting with Pope Francis, without a face mask.",在哈萨克斯坦首都机场，军乐队和包括总统托卡耶夫在内的高级官员迎接了习近平。和习近平一样，哈萨克斯坦官员都戴着口罩，显然是为了尊重中国防止新冠病毒传播的严格措施。哈萨克斯坦总统最近还在没有戴口罩的情况下进行了其他公务，包括与教皇弗朗西斯会面。
"Chinese state media reports depicted Mr. Tokayev as showering Mr. Xi with praise, calling him ""a genuine great leader"" and awarding him the Order of the Golden Eagle, the highest honor given by the president for service to Kazakhstan.","中国官方媒体报道称，托卡耶夫对习近平大加赞赏，称他为""真正的伟大领袖""，并授予他金鹰勋章，这是哈萨克斯坦总统授予的、象征为该国服务的最高荣誉。"
"In Uzbekistan, Mr. Xi is expected to meet with Mr. Putin during a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a multilateral, security-focused organization that includes China, Russia, India, Pakistan and four Central Asian nations.",习近平预计将在乌兹别克斯坦举行上海合作组织峰会期间与普京会晤。上合组织是一个以安全为主的多边机构，成员包括中国、俄罗斯、印度、巴基斯坦和四个中亚国家。
"The topic on everyone's mind, the war in Ukraine, will likely be publicly played down as the leaders focus on regional trade. Russia, China and Mongolia have tentatively agreed to build a new gas pipeline, Mr. Putin said last week, and the leaders of the three countries are set to meet on the sidelines of the Uzbekistan summit.",全世界都关心的乌克兰战争可能会在公开场合被淡化，因为与会领导人的注意力都放在区域贸易上。普京曾在上周表示，俄罗斯、中国和蒙古国已初步同意修建一条新的天然气管道，这三个国家的领导人将在乌兹别克斯坦峰会见面。
"The biggest item on the agenda will be the building of roads and pipelines to move goods and fossil fuels across the region, said Niva Yau, a senior researcher at the OSCE Academy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.",上合峰会议程中的最大项目，将是为该地区运输货物和化石燃料修建公路和管道的事情，吉尔吉斯斯坦比什凯克的欧洲安全与合作组织学院高级研究员邱芷恩(Niva Yau)说。
"""No one is really going to address the Ukraine war so openly, but everyone will say why transit potential is important,"" Ms. Yau said.","""没有人会真的会公开地讨论乌克兰战争，但所有人都将对为什么运输潜力很重要发表看法，""邱芷恩说。"
"The meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi will be their first in person since February, at the start of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, when they released a lengthy statement on the ""no limits"" friendship between their nations. Russia's invasion of Ukraine began shortly after the Olympics ended, placing Beijing in the awkward position of continuing to draw closer to Moscow even as it avoided openly endorsing the war or providing the sort of material support that could lead to American sanctions.","普京和习近平将举行自今年2月在北京冬奥会开幕式上见面以来的首次会晤，他们上次见面时发表了长篇联合声明，宣布中俄友谊""无止境""。俄罗斯入侵乌克兰是在冬奥会结束后不久开始的，让北京继续与莫斯科拉近关系的做法有些尴尬，尽管北京避免公开表示支持战争，或向俄罗斯提供可能引发美国制裁的物资支持。"
"The Chinese leadership is attracted to Russia because it can be a partner against American-led Western influence. But Central Asian countries are wary of Russia's intentions and don't think China recognizes their concerns, Ms. Yau said.",中国领导层之所以转向俄罗斯，是因为该国能在对抗以美国为主导的西方影响上成为中国的伙伴。但邱芷恩说，中亚国家对俄罗斯的意图保持警惕，他们认为中国没有意识到他们的担忧。
"China and Russia are ""trying to end Western global dominance and that is in line with China's interest,"" Ms. Yau said. ""The problem is that across Eurasia, everybody understands Russia's goal as revival of the Soviet Union. I don't think this is something China understands or takes seriously.""","中国和俄罗斯""试图结束西方在全球的主导地位，这符合中国利益""，邱芷恩说。""问题在于，在整个欧亚大陆，所有人都知道俄罗斯的目标是恢复苏联。我觉得中国对这个问题缺乏了解，或没有认真对待这件事。"""
"This summer, Yining, a city in the Xinjiang region of far-western China, celebrated a boom of Chinese tourists seeking a sunny respite from Covid worries in their hometowns. Now Yining is under its own grueling, weekslong pandemic lockdown, with residents calling for help over limited food, difficulty getting medicines and drastic shortages of sanitary pads for women.",今年夏天，位于中国西部边远地区新疆的伊宁市曾迎来一波旅游潮，国内的游客们为摆脱对新冠病毒的担忧，离开他们所在的城市，来到这个阳光明媚的地方寻求暂时的缓解。如今，伊宁正处于数周的疫情封控状态下，居民们要求帮助解决缺少食物、难以获得药品以及卫生巾严重短缺等问题。
"People in the city of 600,000 have been commanded to stay in their homes since early August, forcing many to rely largely on neighborhood officials to deliver supplies.",自今年8月初以来，这座城市的60万居民被命令呆在家中，迫使许多人基本上依靠社区官员为他们提供物资。
"One resident contacted by telephone said that he received food every five days but that there was little of nutritional value no fruit, vegetables or meat. He offered only his given name, Zubayr, fearing reprisals from officials over describing the tough conditions.",记者通过电话联系到的一名居民说，他每五天收到一次食物，但营养价值很低，没有水果、蔬菜或肉类。他只说自己叫祖拜尔，没有透露自己的姓氏，因为担心说出当地的恶劣条件会遭到官员的报复。
"The conditions in Yining that people described online or in phone interviews with The New York Times echoed those of other cities in China that shut down to enforce the government's commitment to ""dynamic zero Covid,"" keeping infections of the coronavirus close to zero. Some Shanghai residents complained loudly about food and medicine shortages earlier this year after officials there were overwhelmed during a citywide shutdown that lasted two months.","根据人们在网上的描述或接受《纽约时报》电话采访时说的情况，伊宁的现状与中国其他城市的情况类似，这些城市为了执行政府坚持的""动态清零""政策而采取封控措施，所谓""动态清零""是将新冠病毒的感染病例保持在接近零的水平。今年早些时候，上海曾进行了长达两个月的封控，当地官员在物资供应上应接不暇，一些上海居民曾大声抱怨过食品和药品的短缺。"
"But Yining received little national attention until lately. It is in the northwest corner of Xinjiang, an ethnically divided region that has been under an intense crackdown aimed at Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other largely Muslim minorities. Late last month, the United Nations' human rights office said the Chinese government's mass detentions and other repressive measures in Xinjiang ""may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.""","但伊宁直到最近才受到全国的关注。伊宁位于新疆的西北角，新疆是个多民族聚居地，一直处于针对维吾尔族、哈萨克族和其他以穆斯林为主的少数民族的严厉镇压下。联合国人权办公室在上月底表示，中国政府在新疆实行的大规模拘禁和其他镇压措施""可能构成国际罪行，尤其是危害人类罪""。"
"In recent days, complaints from Yining have generated a surge of online comments in China. Uyghurs abroad have also shared messages describing poor conditions in quarantine facilities for residents suspected of having had close contact with infected people in Yining, which Uyghurs call Ghulja.",近日来，来自伊宁的抱怨在中国引发了网上评论的激增。旅居海外的维吾尔人也分享了一些信息，描述了对密接者进行集中隔离的设施条件恶劣。维吾尔人称伊宁为固勒扎。
"""I think what has happened in Shanghai gets more attention, as it's a financial hub, and Chinese people can protest,"" said Rayhan Asat, a Uyghur human rights lawyer who is a fellow at Yale Law School.","""我觉得，上海发生的事情得到了更多的关注，因为它是金融中心，中国人可以抗议，""耶鲁大学法学院访问学者、维吾尔人权律师莱汉·阿萨特说。"
"""But things have gone so extreme and compelled people to call for attention,"" she said of Yining and other locked down parts of Xinjiang. ""Many don't have the tools or the audacity to share what's happening to them individually.""","""但情况已变得非常糟糕，迫使人们呼吁关注，""阿萨特在提到伊宁和新疆其他被封控地区时说。""许多人没有工具或者胆量，把个人的遭遇分享到网上。"""
"In coming weeks, other cities across China may come under similar pressures. The Communist Party will hold a major congress in mid-October, when delegates are poised to anoint Xi Jinping to another five years as national leader, and local authorities are under intense pressure to stanch outbreaks of Covid that could sully or disrupt the meeting.",在未来几周，中国各地的其他城市可能会面临类似的压力。中共将于10月中旬召开一次重要的代表大会，届时代表们将为习近平再当五年国家领导人进行名义上的授权，地方当局面临着巨大的防疫压力，以防暴发可能给会议造成破坏或干扰的疫情。
"Other parts of Xinjiang, including the regional capital, Urumqi, have also come under tightening Covid restrictions. A burst of infections has brought increased restrictions on Guiyang, a city of 4.5 million in Guizhou Province in southwest China. The Beijing government said that it had confirmed 10 Covid cases in the capital on Saturday, including nine already in isolation as suspected close contacts with known cases.",包括自治区首府乌鲁木齐在内的新疆其他地区也面临着更严格的新冠病毒管控措施。一波突发感染已让中国西南省份贵州有450万人口的城市贵阳处于日益严格的管控之下。北京市政府表示，周六，首都新增本土新冠病毒感染者10例，其中隔离观察人员九例。
"Even scattered cases are a worry for officials preparing to host the party congress in Beijing. On Friday, Sun Chunlan, the vice premier overseeing pandemic efforts, told officials to be especially vigilant on Covid to ensure a successful congress.",即使只是零星的感染病例也让筹备二十大的官员担忧。上周五，负责新冠病毒大流行防疫工作的副总理孙春兰对官员们说，要对新冠病毒保持高度警惕，以确保二十大的成功召开。
"""Upgrade the sensitivity of monitoring and early warning,"" she said, according to Xinhua, China's main state news agency. At the same time, Ms. Sun admonished officials to ""reduce the impact of the pandemic on the life and work of the public to a minimum.""","据中国主要的官方通讯社新华社报道，孙春兰告诫官员们，要""提高监测预警灵敏性""，同时还要""最大限度减少疫情对群众生产生活的影响""。"
"Until late July, officials in Yining appeared jubilant about the return of tourists to the area. In past years, many visitors had been deterred by the intimidating security crackdown and warnings across Xinjiang and then by Covid.",直到今年7月下旬，伊宁的官员们似乎还对游客返回该地区感到欢欣鼓舞。在过去的几年里，新疆各地令人胆怯的治安镇压和警告，以及后来出现的新冠病毒，使许多游客不敢来新疆。
"With many Chinese people unable to travel abroad and looking for domestic holidays, tourism rebounded to the point that some roads were choked with cars and buses. The Xinjiang government issued rules that it said would prevent Covid's spread while sparing visitors serious disruptions. Officials in the Yining area opened a tourist festival with a ceremony featuring hot-air balloons and horse riding.",由于许多中国人无法出国旅行，只能在国内度假，国内的旅游业曾出现大幅反弹，甚至到了一些道路出现交通堵塞的地步。新疆政府已做出部署，称政府将在防止新冠病毒传播的同时，避免让游客受到过度干扰。伊宁地区的官员还为一个旅游节举行了开幕式，其中包括热气球和骑马表演。
"But in late July, Ili the broader area including Yining began announcing scattered Covid cases every day:two, andthen nine, andthen 28. Within a week, the area had recorded over 140 cases. Officials have said the outbreak was from an Omicron variant of the coronavirus that originated abroad.",但在7月底，伊宁所在的伊犁州开始通报每日新增零星病例:第一天两例，第二天九例，第三天28例。一周内，伊犁州已累计通报了近140例。官员们表示，该地区的这轮疫情是由境外传入的奥密克戎变异株引发的。
"At first, the Xinjiang authorities appeared to hope that they could restrict visitor numbers and tighten up checks without hobbling the tourist resurgence. But in mid-August, the Xinjiang government announced that holiday visits from other parts of China to Yining and other infection hot spots would be curtailed.",起初，新疆当局似乎希望可以通过让游客错峰进入景点、加强病毒检测等措施遏制疫情，而不影响旅游业的复苏。但到8月中旬，新疆政府宣布，将暂停从中国其他地区来伊宁和其他感染热点地区的假日旅游。
"The Yining authorities have kept news about the lockdown muted, but in interviews with The Times, residents said they had been ordered to stay at home since early August. On Aug. 13, Ma Xingrui, the Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, made a quick visit to the area and put pressure on local officials, reminding them of Mr. Xi's ""dynamic zero"" Covid goal.","伊宁当局一直对正在采取的封控措施缄口不语，但当地居民在接受时报采访时说，他们自8月初以来就一直被要求呆在家中。8月13日，新疆自治区党委书记马兴瑞去伊犁指导防疫工作时向当地官员施压，提醒他们，新冠病毒""动态清零""的目标是习近平制定的。"
"""Take more vigorous and effective measures,"" Mr. Ma told them, according to an official summary of his comments.","据官方报道，马兴瑞对当地官员们表示，""采取更加有力有效的措施。"""
"Some of the residents said that food deliveries had been reduced to a monotonous diet of rice, naan or instant noodles. They spoke with The Times on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about a reaction from officials.",一些居民说，政府配送的食物已减少为只有清一色的米饭、馕或方便面。由于担心官员的反应，他们与时报交谈时要求不具全名。
"A resident named Azad said there had been nothing but instant noodles for two weeks, which he could no longer face more than twice a day. He said it was wreaking havoc with his digestive system. Earlier in the lockdown, there had at least been rice and naan.",一名叫阿扎德的居民说，两周来，除了方便面什么都没有，他已经无法接受每天两顿方便面的饮食。他说，这种饮食已给他的消化系统造成了损害。在伊宁封城的早期至少曾经发过米饭和馕。
"Several of the women said in phone interviews that they had been unable to obtain sanitary pads, making life very difficult.",几名接受电话采访的女性说，她们一直无法获得卫生巾，这让生活变得非常困难。
"Money is not the main problem, said a woman who gave only her given name, Madina. Items like feminine hygiene products and diapers are often unavailable at official supply stations and simply sell out too quickly to buy online, she said.",一名只说自己叫麦迪娜的女子说，钱不是主要问题。她说，女性卫生用品和婴儿尿布等物品通常在官方供应站无法获得，而网上这类商品常常马上卖光，根本抢不到。
"Residents have also complained online and in letters to the government about dirty quarantine facilities, chaotic enforcement of isolation orders and older people being taken from their homes for medical observation.",居民们还在网上以及给政府写的信里抱怨集中隔离设施肮脏，隔离令执行混乱，以及老年人被从家中带走集中隔离。
Officials have scrambled to head off the rising frustration in Yining by acknowledging failings. Last week they told journalists that there was no truth in rumors that an older resident had hanged himself after suffering severe hunger. The local official news service last week urged overworked local officials to avoid aggravating angry residents.,官员们已在努力防止伊宁日益增长的抱怨升级，他们先是承认了失败。他们上周对记者说，有关一名老年居民由于严重饥饿上吊自杀的传言不属实。当地官方新闻机构上周敦促过度劳累的地方官员避免加剧居民的愤怒。
"""Just think: the members of the public have been locked in their homes for over a month,"" it said.","""试想想，当群众被封闭在家中一个多月，""官媒说。"
"On Sunday, the health authorities in Xinjiang said that Yining had detected 12 cases of Covid infection the previous day.",新疆卫生部门周日通报称，伊宁市前一天新增了12例确诊病例。
"As fire was raging in the mountains surrounding the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, 10 million residents stood in 100-plus-degree heat to get Covid tests. Two cases were detected that day in August.",8月的一天，当大火在中国重庆周围的山区肆虐时，1000万居民在40度高温下接受新冠病毒检测。那天，重庆共发现了两例确诊病例。
"A week earlier in Xiamen, in the country's southeast, pandemic workers swabbed the throats of fishermen before they tested their catch of fish and crab. Cars got swabbed, too, at an auto show last week in Chengdu, in the southwest.",在那一周前，在厦门，防疫人员给渔民进行咽喉拭子检测后，对他们捕获的鱼蟹也做了检测。上周在西南部城市成都举行的车展上，汽车也做了检测。
"When a strong earthquake struck Chengdu on Monday, the first instinct of many residents was not to run for safety but to ask for permission to leave their homes underlockdown. ""Don't come downstairs! @all,"" a property managerwarnedin a group chat. In Luding County, the epicenter of the earthquake, which killed at least 86 people, the local government told residents to make sure they got tested every day.","周一，当成都发生强烈地震时，许多居民的第一反应不是逃命，而是请求允许他们离开被封锁的住所。""大家不要下楼!!@所有人，""一名物业经理在微信群中警告。在震中泸定县，地震造成至少86人遇难，当地政府要求居民每天须做核酸。"
"As much of the world tries to move on from thepandemic, the Chinese Communist Party clings to it, turning itszero-Covidpolicy into a political campaign that mandates the participation of 1.4 billion people.",当世界上大部分地区都在试图走出新冠疫情之际，中国共产党仍然毫不动摇，将清零政策转变为一场强制要求14亿人参与的政治运动。
"In their precarious existence filled with lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing, the Chinese public puts up a show, 24/7, for an audience of one: the country's top leader, Xi Jinping, who is expected to secure a third term at an importantCommunist Party congressnext month.",在充斥着封锁、隔离和大规模检测等不确定性的生活中，中国公众每天24小时不间断地举办着一场表演，这场表演的观众只有一个:中国最高领导人习近平，预计他将在下月举行的一个重要的共产党代表大会上获得第三个任期。
"Some people play their roles with enthusiasm, others with indifference or resentment. No matter what, the Kafkaesque show must go on until Mr. Xi says, ""Stop.""","有些人在扮演他们的角色时充满热情，有些人则表现出冷漠或怨恨。无论如何，卡夫卡式的表演必须持续到习近平喊""停""为止。"
"The zero-Covid campaign is probably the clearest testament to the power of Mr. Xi, who proved that he is as capable of mobilizing the masses asMao Zedong, the founder of the People's Republic of China, who launched the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.",新冠清零运动可能是对习近平的权力最为明确的证明，他证明了自己和毛泽东一样具有发动群众的能力。毛泽东是中华人民共和国的创立者，发动了大跃进和文化大革命。
"Mao didn't care that people starved to death or that the country was thrown into chaos in those two disastrous campaigns. Mr. Xi doesn't seem to care that his campaign has been extremely disruptive even as the coronavirus has become much milder, if more transmittable.",毛泽东不在乎人们被饿死，也不在乎国家在这两场灾难性运动中陷入混乱。习近平似乎也不在乎他的这场运动已极具破坏性，尽管新冠病毒已经变得温和许多(虽然传播性也许更强)。
"His strategy has contained the pandemic. China reports fewer than 2,000 new cases each day of late, most of them asymptomatic. The country has reported 5,226 Covid-related deaths since early 2020 and none since May, according to the National Health Commission.",他的策略控制住了疫情。中国最近每天报告的新增病例不到2000例，其中大多数是无症状感染者。根据国家卫健委的数据，自2020年初以来，中国共报告了5226例与新冠病毒相关的死亡，自5月以来就没有新增死亡病例。
"China's authoritarian approach proved especiallyeffectivein much of 2020 and 2021, when the United States and Europe were struggling with high death and infection rates. Mr. Xi has been using the temporary success as evidence that China's top-down governance model is superior to that of liberal democracies. He refuses to abandon his old playbook of lockdowns, mass testing and quarantines in favor of learning to coexist with the milder variants that emerged this year.",在2020年和2021年的大部分时间里，中国的威权主义方法被证明尤其有效，当时的美国和欧洲都苦于高死亡率和高感染率。习近平一直以当时暂时的成功作为证据，来证明中国自上而下的治理模式优于自由民主国家。他拒绝放弃封锁、大规模检测和隔离的老办法，不愿转而学习与今年出现的较温和的病毒变种共存。
"As of Tuesday, 49 Chinese cities were imposing some sort of lockdown measures, affecting around 292 million people, up from 161 million in the previous week, according to the investment bank Nomura. It's taking a serious economic toll. At the beginning of the year, Nomura expected China's economy to grow 4.3 percent in 2022. After successive rounds of lockdowns, it lowered its forecast to 2.7 percent.",根据投资银行野村证券的数据，截至上周二，中国有49个城市实施了某种形式的封锁，约2.92亿人受到影响，高于前一周的1.61亿人。这造成了严重的经济损失。今年年初，野村证券预计中国2022年经济增长将达到4.3%。在连续几轮封锁之后，它将预测下调至2.7%。
"The Communist Party has defended its policy, saying that relaxing the Covid restrictions could cause widespread infections in a country with limited medical resources and a large population of older people, among whom 15 percent are not fully vaccinated. The partysaidit would crack down on any speech or behavior that distorted, questioned or disapproved of the policy.",中共为它的防疫政策进行了辩护，称在一个医疗资源总量不足、老龄人口多的国家(15%的老年人没有完全接种疫苗)，放松疫情防控势必造成大规模人群感染。中共表示，坚决同一切歪曲、怀疑、否定防疫方针政策的言行作斗争。
Many Chinese buy into the narrative and willingly act as foot soldiers in the party's fight against the virus.,许多中国人相信这个说法，并愿意在党的抗击病毒斗争中充当走卒。
"Last week, passengers on a bus in the northeastern city of Dalian scolded a man for wearing merely a surgical mask, not an N95 respirator mask that the local government required in an announcement a few hours earlier. ""Get off the bus!"" they yelled at the man, according to official Chinesemedia. ""You're wicked."" One of the passengers called the police, who led him off the bus.","上周，在大连的一辆公共汽车上，乘客斥责一名只戴了外科口罩的男子，因为他未按当地政府数小时前发布公告要求佩戴的N95口罩。""下去吧!""据中国官方媒体报道，他们朝这名男子大喊道。""缺德。""一名乘客报了警，警察将他带下车。"
"Dalian reported 40 Covid infection cases, all asymptomatic, that day. The next day the government locked down the city of seven million people and suspended all public transportation.",大连当天报告了40例确诊病例，均为无症状感染者。第二天，政府封锁了这座有700万人口的城市，并暂停了所有公共交通。
"A tech writer shared in a WeChatpostlast weekend that he and his wife had caught Covid in Singapore, and that they, as well as the city-state, were doing just fine far from the horror stories that many Chinese people were led to believe. The pandemic was over for most countries in the world, he declared.",一名科技类作者上周末在微信公众号中写道，他和妻子在新加坡感染了新冠，他们以及这个城市国家的情况都不错——远非许多中国人被引导相信的恐怖故事。他断言，世界上大多数国家的疫情已经结束。
"""You're doing fine,"" a reader in Beijing commented, ""but can you be sure the others will be fine, too? So selfish. Unfollowed. ""","""你没事，""北京的一位读者评论道，""能保证其他人没事吗?这么自私，取关了。"""
"What gives the campaign the most Kafkaesque quality is that no matter how bizarre, absurd or illogical the rules are, most people follow them without question.",这场运动最卡夫卡式的特质在于，无论规则多么离奇、荒谬或不合逻辑，大多数人都会毫不犹豫地遵守。
"When China's national team played in the 2022 Asian Women's Volleyball Cup in the Philippines last month, the players followed instructions from higher-ups to wearmasksand lost their first set against Iran. The team won the match after the players took off the masks.",上个月，中国国家队在菲律宾出战2022年女排亚洲杯比赛时，队员们听从上级指示戴上口罩，首局输给了伊朗队。后来球员摘下口罩，球队赢得了比赛。
"A woman living in a small city in northwestern China told me that she'd had many arguments with her husband and her parents after they told her to stop complaining about Covid restrictions. Everyone was following the rules, they scolded her, why couldn't you?",一名住在中国西北一座小城市的女士告诉我，她和丈夫及她的父母吵过很多次，他们叫她不要再抱怨防疫管控措施了。他们说她，大家都能守规矩，你为什么就不行呢?
"She shared photos and videos of pandemic life in her small town last week. Loudspeakers started blasting at 5 a.m., urging residents to get tested. For hours, the same piercing instructions would blare throughout the city: ""Property owners, please come down to get Covid tests. It will end at 9.""","上周，她分享了小城疫情生活的照片和视频。每天早上五点，大喇叭开始响起，敦促大家做检测。在接下来的几个小时，同样刺耳的声音会在全城响起:""各位业主，请下楼做核酸检测。9点结束。"""
"Her 5-year-old daughter was always eager to get tested, she said, because otherwise she wouldn't be able to go out and play with her friends.",她说，自己五岁的女儿总是盼着接受检测，否则就没法出去跟朋友们玩耍。
"After each Covid test, a person gets a sticker, and most put it on the back of their phones, said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for safety reasons. The sticker is different every day. It could be a cartoonish drawing of a police officer, a volunteer or a famous historical figure.",这名女士表示，在每次核酸检测后，每个人都会得到一张贴纸，大多数人会把它贴在手机背面。出于安全原因，她要求匿名。贴纸每天都不一样，有时是警察、志愿者或著名历史人物的卡通画。
"Residents have to show the stickers to security guards in office buildings, residential compounds, shopping malls and schools. Without it, they can't move around.",居民必须向写字楼、住宅区、商场和学校的保安人员出示贴纸。没有贴纸，他们就无法四处走动。
"Local authorities have become increasingly harsh in punishing those who don't follow the zero-Covid rules. In recent months, many people weredetainedby the police for five to 10 days for failing to get Covid tests. Officers in the northwestern province of Shaanxi detained a 20-year-old man for five days in August because he hadskippedtwo Covid tests and had ridden a bike. His behavior ""posed risks of spreading the virus,"" they said.","对于那些不遵守清零规则的人，地方当局的惩罚变得越来越严厉。近几个月来，许多人因没有接受新冠检测而被警方拘留五至10天。8月，陕西的警察将一名20岁的男子拘留五天，原因是他两次没有参加核酸检测，并在外面骑自行车。他们说，他的行为""存在疫情传播风险""。"
"Pandemic control workers, in their white hazmat suits, have come to embody the absurdity and the brutality of the campaign.",身着白色防护服的防疫人员已经成为这场运动之荒谬和残酷的具体体现。
"Nicknamed Dabai, or Big White, they are omnipresent. They rode onhorsebackto test Tibetan herdsmen. Theywalkedin heavy snow in China's westernmost county to swab the throats of border patrol agents. They even regularlytestedthe staff in China's research stations in Antarctica.","绰号""大白""的防疫人员无所不在。他们骑着马去给藏族牧民做核酸采样。他们冒着大雪走在中国最西部的县城，给护边员做核酸。他们甚至定期对中国南极科考站的工作人员进行检测。"
There's no way to avoid the Big White.,"没人能躲过""大白""。"
"In a widely shared video on Chinese social media, a giant inflated Big White rose over the city ofWuhan, where the coronavirus was first reported.","在中国社交媒体上广为流传的一段视频中，一只巨大的充气""大白""在武汉上空升起，这里是首次报告新冠病毒的地方。"
"""The white terror"" and ""The Big White is watching you"" are among the most-liked comments. So is ""Please test the Yangtze River Bridge,"" which refers to the bridge in the video.","在最多人点赞的评论中包括""白色恐怖""和""大白在看着你""。还有""请检测长江大桥""——指的是视频中的大桥。"
"Tens of millions of Chinese confined at home, schools closed, businesses in limbo and whole cities at a standstill. Once again, China is locking down enormous parts of society, trying to completely eradicate Covid in a campaign that grows more anomalous by the day as the rest of the world learns to live with the coronavirus.",数千万的中国人被关在家中，学校关闭，商业活动停滞，一座座城市都处于静止状态。中国再次封锁了很大一部分社会活动，试图用一场运动彻底根除新冠病毒。随着世界其他地方逐渐学会与新冠共存，这场运动显得愈来愈反常。
"But even as the costs of China's zero-Covid strategy are mounting, Beijing faces a stark reality: It has backed itself into a corner. Three years of its uncompromising, heavy-handed approach of imposing lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing to isolate infections have left it little room, at least in the short term, to change course.",尽管中国的清零策略代价越来越大，北京还面临一个严峻的现实:它已使自己陷入了困境。三年来，为隔绝感染，中国采取不妥协而强硬的措施，实行封锁、隔离和大规模检测，至少在短期内，它几乎没有多少改变方向的余地。
"China's leader, Xi Jinping, has made clear that zero Covid is as much an ideological undertaking as a public health one. He has tied support for the policy to support for the Communist Party, and hailed its execution as proof of China's edge over Western democracies. He has prioritized nationalism over the guidance of scientists. Any reversal, or adjustment, would seem to undercut his vision, especially ahead of a major Communist Party meeting next month where Mr. Xi is all but assured to extend his rule.",中国领导人习近平已明确表示，清零政策不仅是公共卫生事业，同时也是意识形态任务。他将对该政策的支持与对中共的支持划等号，并将该政策的执行作为中国比西方民主国家更优越的证据。他将民族主义置于科学家的指导之上。任何反转乃至调整似乎都会损害他的愿景，特别是在下个月即将召开中共重大会议，而习近平几乎肯定会延续统治的情况下。
"The emphasis on politics has created practical problems. Beijing has refused to approve foreign vaccines, opting instead to provide only less effective homegrown ones to its 1.4 billion people. The government has pushed propaganda depicting the virus as having devastated Western countries, feeding widespread stigma and a fear of infections even among the young and healthy. It has silenced voices seeking to offer a different approach, labeling them traitors.",对政治的强调导致了实际层面的问题。北京拒绝批准引进外国疫苗，只向全国14亿人口提供效果不那么好的国产疫苗。政府推动政治宣传攻势，称病毒摧毁了西方国家，助长了普遍的污名化和对感染的恐惧，即使在年轻和健康的群体中也是如此。它还压制寻求不同应对办法的声音，给他们贴上叛徒的标签。
"Buoyed by its early success at containment, the party was slow at first to encourage vaccination, leaving many older Chinese vulnerable. Since few Chinese have natural immunity from the virus, the risks of loosening controls are potentially even higher.",出于对疫情初期成功控制病毒传播的自满，中共在鼓励接种疫苗方面进展缓慢，使得许多老龄中国人易受感染。由于几乎没有中国人对病毒产生自然免疫力，放松管控的风险可能会更高。
"""That sort of makes the zero-Covid policy self-sustaining,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.","""这在某种程度上使得清零政策能够自行维持下去，""美国外交关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠表示。"
"At least 65 million Chinese are currently under some form of lockdown, according to a tally by Chinese media, including the southwestern city of Chengdu, home to 21 million people. In cities that are not battling outbreaks, quashing Covid still dictates the rhythms of daily life. Residents line up for mandatory, regular testing and obsessively monitor their health codes, digital markers that dictate whether they can move freely.",据中国媒体统计，目前至少有6500万中国人处于某种形式的封锁之下，其中包括拥有2100万人口的西南城市成都。在不受疫情影响的城市，消灭新冠病毒仍主导着日常生活的节奏。居民们排队接受强制性的定期检测，翻来覆去检查自己的健康码，这是一种指示他们是否可以自由行动的数字标记。
"Many Chinese have found ways to cope, even if reluctantly: putting in longer hours to scrape up more money, cutting back on spending. Complaints about a shortage of medical care or food often emerge, but some residents say they support the overarching goal.",即便很不情愿，但许多中国人已经找到了应对办法:加班加点挣更多钱，减少开支。虽然经常出现对医疗服务或食物不足的抱怨，但一些居民表示，他们支持这种大局。
"""Who can get used to this?"" said Zhang Lang, a grocery store owner in the southwestern city of Guiyang, who has been under lockdown for three days. ""But there's no choice,"" he said. ""The epidemic is coming. Do you want what happened in America to happen here?""","""你说这谁习惯得了?""西南城市贵阳的杂货店老板张浪说，他已被封锁三天。""但是没办法，因为疫情，""他说。""疫情都来了，难道要搞得和美国一样吗?"""
"Still, the question is how long China's calculus will remain in favor of the current approach. Youth unemployment is soaring, small businesses are collapsing and overseas companies are shifting their supply chains elsewhere. A sustained slowdown would undermine the promise of economic growth, long the central pillar of the party's legitimacy.",问题在于，中国的考量还能维持到什么时候。青年失业率飙升，小企业纷纷倒闭，海外企业则开始将供应链转移至其他地方。如果经济持续低迷，长期以来都作为中共执政合法性核心支柱的经济增长承诺就会遭到破坏。
"""The social and economic cost will continue to increase. So I think ultimately they're going to reach a point where the cost exceeds the benefits,"" Dr. Huang said. But, he added, ""it just might be farther off.""","""社会和经济代价会继续增加。所以我认为，他们早晚都会走到成本超过收益的地步，""黄严忠说。但他也表示，""这可能还很遥远。"""
"For now, officials are sticking closely to the status quo, imposing the most extensive lockdowns in months to contain a series of new outbreaks.",眼下，官员仍紧守现状，施行数月以来最广泛的封锁措施，以遏制接连不断的新疫情。
"The authorities in Guiyang, population six million, ordered a partial lockdown this week after detecting several hundred cases in recent days. In Shanghai, where one asymptomatic infection was announced on Tuesday, officials imposed a one-week lockdown on a hotel where the patient had stayed and urged all residents not to leave the city during a public holiday this weekend.",近段时间发现数百起病例后，人口600万的贵阳当局本周下令实施部分封锁。在上海，周二公布了一例无症状感染，官员对该患者住过的一家酒店进行了为期一周的封锁，并敦促所有居民在本周末的公共假期期间不要离开这座城市。
"Because of the high political stakes, local governments are likely to err on the side of overreaction to contain outbreaks, said Chen Xi, an associate professor of public health at Yale University. Scores of city officials have been fired or otherwise punished after cases emerged in their jurisdictions. The party meeting on Oct. 16 is adding to the pressure on officials.",耶鲁大学公共卫生学院副教授陈希表示，由于政治上的高度风险，地方政府可能宁可用错误的过度反应来控制疫情。大批市级官员在辖区出现病例后被免职或遭受其他处罚。10月16日的党代会也增加了对官员的压力。
"""Given the sensitive timing before the party congress, local governments are afraid of making any mistakes, making the central government's policies unnecessarily more stringent,"" Professor Chen said.","""鉴于党代会召开前的敏感时期，地方政府害怕犯错误，使中央政府的政策变得过于严格，""陈希说。"
"China's pursuit of zero Covid has often been single-minded, overriding all other concerns. Hospitals trying to avoid the risk of infection have turned away patients in dire need of care. Enforcers of lockdowns have barged into people's homes or killed pets left behind by quarantined owners. When a 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Luding County in Sichuan Province on Monday, residents in the locked-down city of Chengdu, the provincial capital, were blocked from leaving their homes even as buildings shook, according to widely circulated posts on social media.",中国对清零的追求常常是一根筋的，凌驾于其他一切问题之上。医院为了避免感染风险，曾将急需救助的患者拒之门外。封锁的执行者闯入民宅或扑杀被隔离者留下的宠物。根据社交媒体上广为流传的帖子，周一四川省泸定县发生6.8级地震时，在被封锁的省会成都，即使建筑物摇晃，居民也被阻止离开家。
"After a public outcry, Chengdu health officials clarified that physical safety was the top priority in the case of natural disasters.",在公众强烈抗议之后，成都卫生官员澄清说，在发生自然灾害的情况下，应优先保障市民群众生命安全。
"The challenge for China is that its own policies have made it harder to ease restrictions. While other countries prioritized vaccinating the elderly, China made older residents among the last to be eligible, citing concerns about side effects. And it never introduced vaccine passes, perhaps sensitive to public skepticism of its own vaccines.",中国面临的挑战是，其自身的政策使得放宽限制变得更加困难。虽然其他国家优先考虑为老年人接种疫苗，但出于对副作用的担忧，中国将老年居民列为最后接种疫苗的人群。而且它从未采用疫苗通行证，也许是出于对公众质疑本土疫苗的敏感。
"In late July, about 67 percent of people aged 60 and above had received a third shot, compared to 72 percent of the entire population. Medical experts have warned that an uncontrolled outbreak could lead to high numbers of deaths among the elderly, as occurred during a wave this spring in Hong Kong, which also suffered from low vaccination rates.",7月下旬，大约67%的60岁及以上的人接受了第三针疫苗，而整体人口的三针接种率为72%。医学专家警告说，不受控制的疫情可能导致大量老年人死亡，就像今年春天在香港发生的那波疫情一样，该地区也受困于低接种率。
"But those considerations are entangled with politics, too. China has refused to approve Western mRNA vaccines, though it has struggled to produce its own; its homegrown, inactivated vaccines have proved less clinically effective.",但这些考虑也同政治纠缠在一起。中国拒绝批准西方的mRNA疫苗，尽管它在生产自己的mRNA疫苗方面面临困境;事实证明，其本土生产的灭活疫苗在临床上不太有效。
"Cai Xia, a retired professor at the Communist Party's top academy, attributed China's inflexible approach to Mr. Xi's desire for total control. In an essay published Wednesday in Foreign Affairs, Ms. Cai, who now lives in the United States, said Mr. Xi had overruled health experts throughout the pandemic.",中共中央党校退休教授蔡霞将中国不灵活的做法归因于习近平想要全面控制的愿望。在周三发表于《外交事务》(Foreign Affairs)的一篇文章中，现居美国的蔡霞说，整个大流行期间，习近平拒绝听取卫生专家的意见。
"""A leader more open to influence or subject to greater checks would not likely have implemented such a draconian policy, or at least would have corrected course once its costs and unpopularity became evident,"" she wrote, in reference to this spring's lockdown in Shanghai, which led many residents to report shortages of food and medical care. ""But for Xi, backtracking would have been an unthinkable admission of error.""","""倘若领导人更开放地接受影响性的意见或被更有力的制衡，似乎不太可能实施如此严厉的政策;抑或一旦成本和民怨变得显而易见，起码会改弦易辙，""她在谈到今年春天在上海的封锁时写道，封锁导致许多居民报告食品和医疗保健短缺。""但对习近平来说，收回成命就好像是承认错误，绝无可能。"""
There may come a point at which the economic consequences of zero Covid force Beijing to consider a reset.,清零政策的经济后果可能会在某个时刻迫使北京重新考虑对策。
"Youth unemployment has reached a record 20 percent, according to official statistics in August. The nearly three dozen Chinese cities under some form of lockdown represent one-third of China's entire economic output, according to Hao Hong, the chief economist and a partner at Grow Investment Management in Hong Kong.",根据8月的官方统计数据，青年失业率已达到创纪录的20%。香港GROW思睿首席经济学家兼合伙人洪灝表示，30多个中国城市正处于某种形式的封锁，这些城市占中国全部经济产出的三分之一。
"Survival is top of mind for business owners like Lu Wei, 50, who runs a restaurant in Daqing, in northeastern China. She and her husband have been sealed at home for three weeks, and she worries about how she will pay rent. She is relying on the government for deliveries of fresh vegetables and drawing from her store of pickled vegetables when they don't arrive.",50岁的吕伟在中国东北的大庆经营着一家餐馆，对于她这样的企业主来说，最重要的是生存。她和丈夫被封在家中三周，她担心如何支付房租。她依赖政府送来的新鲜蔬菜，如果蔬菜没有送到，她就从自家店里拿腌菜。
"But Ms. Lu said she was used to measures such as daily testing and believed they could keep her safe. She said she did not have any specific changes she would like to see to Covid policies, other than perhaps the flexibility to order online food deliveries.",但吕伟说，她已经习惯了每日核酸检测等措施，相信这些措施可以保证她的安全。她说，对于新冠防控政策，也许除了希望允许更灵活地在网上叫外卖之外，她没有什么具体想要改变的。
"""I just hope we can achieve zero as soon as possible,"" she said.","""我就希望早点清零，""她说。"
"A dull blue jacket, oversize trousers, a Communist Party member pin adding a splash of red on the chest, a small briefcase in hand. It's the typical dress of the typical Chinese official, and has long been the very opposite of the look that many young Chinese strive for.",沉闷的蓝色外套，宽松的裤子，胸前一枚红色党徽，手提一个小公文包。这是典型中国官员的典型着装，长期以来与许多中国年轻人追求的形象相去甚远。
But now the cadre look is cool.,但现在，这种干部装变酷了。
"On Chinese social media platforms where trendsetters trade fashion tips, young people mostly men have been sharing pictures of themselves dressed like their strait-laced, middle-aged dads working in Communist Party offices. They call the trend ""ting ju feng,"" or ""office and bureau style"" meaning the working wear of a typical mid-rank bureaucrat.","在引领潮流者交流时尚心得的中国社交媒体平台上，年轻人(主要是男性)分享他们穿着与在中共办公室上班的古板中年父亲类似着装的照片。他们把这个趋势称为""厅局风""——指的是典型中层官僚工作时穿的衣服。"
"The paragon of this determinedly dull look is China's top leader, Xi Jinping. He is highly likely to win another five years in power in October, when about 2,300 delegates gather for a Communist Party congress in Beijing. Many of those officials will be wearing Western-style suits and ties for that special occasion. Back at the office, though, countless officials now sport the dark blue wind jacket favored by Mr. Xi.",中国最高领导人习近平是这种坚定沉闷外表的典范。他很可能在今年10月召开、将有2300多名党代表参加的中共全国代表大会上赢得继续掌权五年的机会。出席这个重要会议的许多官员穿西装、打领带。但现在，无数官员平时上班穿的都是习近平喜欢的那种暗蓝色防风夹克。
"Despite his immense power, Mr. Xi has not been seen as a fashion influencer until now. Some followers of the trend may be tongue in cheek, poking fun at China's era of conformity. Others say that they are in earnest and that for many young Chinese, the look suggests a stable career path and a respectable lifestyle a Communist Party version of the preppy look.","尽管习近平有巨大的影响力，但此前他并不被视为时装潮流引领者。一些追""厅局风""的人也许是穿着玩的，是在取笑中国墨守成规的时代。也有一些人说，他们穿这种服装是认真的，对许多中国年轻人来说，这种穿着意味着稳定的职业道路和体面的生活方式，可以说是共产党版本的预科生造型。"
"""Compared with the clothes with fashion-brand logos, this style is more dignified and poised,"" Yang Zhan, a 21-year-old electric engineering student in Anhui Province, in central China, wrote in a message replying to questions from The New York Times. He had posted a picture of himself wearing his father's navy blue jacket and mother's Communist Party member pin on Xiaohongshu, one of the fastest-growing social platforms targeting young Chinese.","""相比于满是logo的衣服，这种比较端庄、大方，""安徽省21岁的电气工程专业学生杨占(音)在回复《纽约时报》提问的短信中写道。他在""小红书""上发了一张自己穿着父亲的藏青色夹克、戴着母亲党徽的照片。""小红书""是发展最快的中国年轻人社交媒体平台之一。"
"On Xiaohongshu, hashtags for the trend have amassed more than five million views. Young government employees have posted their daily looks, and students have also posted selfies in the cadre-wear. Some young women also show off the styles of their civil servant boyfriends. Canny garment sellers have even started including the ""office bureau style"" label in their online ads for clothes usually bought by middle-aged men.","在小红书上，""厅局风""这个话题标签已积累了逾500万点击量。年轻的公务员们晒出日常着装，学生们也晒出了身穿干部服的自拍。一些年轻女性还炫耀公务员男友们的时尚。精明的服装销售商们甚至已开始在网络广告中添加了""厅局风""标签，这些衣服通常由中年男子购买。"
"There are limits to the appeal of the cadre look. Mr. Yang's pictures attracted admiring comments online, but he said he would never wear the outfit to class. ""Otherwise my classmates would say I'm stinking with smugness,"" he said. ""Maybe it's a little too mature.""","干部形象的魅力是有限的。虽然杨先生晒的照片在网上获得了赞赏，但他说，他永远不会穿那种服装去上课。""同学会说我瞎臭美，""他说。""可能是成熟点了吧。"""
"Though the cadre look is far from dominating fashion sales, the emergence of the unabashedly conventional look reflects China's conservative political turn.",虽然干部装远未主导时尚销售，但这种毫不掩饰的守旧形象的出现反映了中国政治的保守转向。
"""That jacket has long been popular among cadres,"" said John Fitzgerald, an expert on China's cadre culture and an emeritus professor at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. ""The style is understated, that says, 'Don't look at me'. What's new is the popularity among young people.""","""这种夹克在干部中一直很受欢迎，""研究中国干部文化的专家、澳大利亚墨尔本斯威本技术大学名誉教授费约翰(John Fitzgerald)说。""这种风格很低调，像是在说'不要看我'。它在年轻人中受欢迎是个新情况。"""
"Cadres often used to dress much more expensively, sporting flashy accessories like luxury watches and expensive belts. But that was before Mr. Xi's anti-corruption campaign began in 2012. Mr. Xi's signature blue jacket has echoes of the Mao suit, which was worn by many Chinese people, especially officials, before commercial fashion and Western-style suits took off in China in the 1980s.",干部们的穿戴曾经昂贵得多，佩戴奢侈的手表和昂贵的皮带等华丽配件。但那是在习近平于2012年开始反腐运动之前。习近平标志性的蓝色外套与毛泽东的中山装有异曲同工之妙，在20世纪80年代商业时尚和西装在中国兴起之前，许多中国人，尤其是官员，都穿中山装。
"The cadre style's popularity may also reflect the high interest in holding a government post, especially while the economy has slowed sharply. Last year a record two million people registered to take the national government agencies' hiring exam.",干部风格现在受到的欢迎也许反映了人们对政府固定职位的高度兴趣，尤其是在经济急剧放缓的时候。去年，报名参加中央政府机构招聘考试的人数达到了创纪录的200万。
"""When big internet companies are having rounds of layoffs, the 'office bureau style' is sending out an unspoken message of being reliable, stable and rid of intensive competition,"" Hu Zhen, a Chinese fashion blogger, said in a recent video.","""在互联网大厂都纷纷裁员的当下，厅局风却默默传递出踏实 、稳定、反内卷的气息，""中国时尚博主胡榛在最近发布的一段视频中说。"
"For junior workers, Mr. Hu recommended a short-sleeved white shirt with a chest pocket big enough to hold a small notebook, a handy tool for field visits by public servants.",胡榛给初级工作人员的建议是，白色短袖衬衫，胸前的口袋大到足够装下一个小笔记本，以便公务员实地考察时随身携带。
"So far no state outlets have openly encouraged the trend among young people, but if they did, it would not be surprising. The government strictly monitors every aspect of youth culture online, blurring images of tattoos and revising lyrics with negative connotations. Pop idols attending government functions and interviewed by the state news media have also sometimes dressed in ting ju feng.","迄今还没有官方媒体公开鼓励年轻人穿干部装，但如果官媒这样做了，也不足为奇。中国政府对网上青年文化的所有方面严格监控，将纹身图像模糊化，修改带有负面含义的歌词。出席政府活动或接受国家新闻媒体采访的流行偶像有时也会穿""厅局风""服装。"
"In fact, Mr. Xi once compared the value orientation of young people to buttoning up a shirt. ""If the first button is done wrong, the rest will all go wrong.""","实际上，习近平曾将年轻人的价值取向比做穿衣服扣扣子。""如果第一粒扣子扣错了，剩余的扣子都会扣错。"""
"Still, many young people think ting ju feng is just a social media fad. Wei Zhangnan, a Beijing business consultant, posted his cadre look but added that it might not last. ""Probably it will soon be gone,"" he said. ""Not everybody is fond of the old cadre vibe.""","尽管如此，许多年轻人认为""厅局风""只是社交媒体上的短暂狂热。北京的商务顾问魏章南(音)在网上晒出自己穿干部装的照片后补充道，""厅局风""也许不会持续太久。""也许过一阵就不流行了，""他说。""并不是所有人都喜欢老干部风格。"""
Others are rolling their eyes at the look and the fascination it reflects with civil servant culture.,"也有一些人对""厅局风""及其反映的公务员文化对人们的极大吸引力表示不以为然。"
"""The profession is being looked up to as if it has a halo on it now,"" said Tina Zhou, a law student from northeastern Liaoning Province. ""If anybody who is not a civil servant deliberately dresses like this in daily life, I would think he is a bit too uptight and stern.""","""公务员这个专业已经自带光环了，""来自东北辽宁省的法律系学生蒂娜·周说。"" 但是日常生活中刻意追求这种穿搭，我会觉得这个人有点古板严肃。"""
"HONG KONG When a prominent woman in China's #MeToo movement took on a powerful man in court, it was the accused, not the accuser, who was held up as the victim. When several women were savagely beaten by men after resisting unwanted advances in a restaurant, the focus of the story pivoted from gender violence to gang violence. And when a mother of eight was found chained to the wall of a doorless shack, it was her mental fitness not her imprisonment that became the talking point.","香港——当中国""#我也是""运动中的一名著名女性将一名权势男性告上法庭时，被视为受害者的并非原告，而是被告。当几名女性在一家餐馆拒绝惹人厌的搭讪而被男性毒打，事件的焦点从性别暴力转向了黑社会暴力。当人们发现一名八孩母亲被链条锁在没有门的棚屋墙上，她的精神健康——而非被监禁的状态——成为了讨论话题。"
"Each incident went viral online in China, initially touching off a wave of outrage over violence against women. But in every case, the conversation was quickly censored to minimize the ways in which women had been abused.",以上每起事件都是中国互联网的火爆话题，在一开始引发了对暴力侵害女性行为的愤怒浪潮。但在每起事件中，讨论都很快被审查，以尽量减少谈及女性被虐待的状况。
"China's Communist Party has long promoted gender equality as one of its core tenets, yet as such cases continue to make national headlines, Beijing has done little to address calls for accountability. Fearing social unrest, the party has instead used social media censors to stifle criticism and amplify comments that support the government's preferred narrative of social harmony.",长期以来，中共一直将性别平等当做其核心原则之一，但随着此类案件持续成为全国焦点，北京方面基本没有采取行动来回应追究责任的呼声。由于担心社会动荡，中共转而利用社交媒体审查来压制批评，并放大了支持政府偏好的弘扬和谐社会的评论。
"When a story becomes popular online, the party's propaganda department will send guidelines to managers at large social media companies for how to handle the topic, said King-wa Fu, a professor at the Journalism and Media Studies Center of the University of Hong Kong. Censors then remove popular comments or accounts that voice opinions that stray too far from the party line.",香港大学新闻及传媒研究中心教授傅景华表示，如果某一事件成为网络热点，中共的宣传部门就会向大型互联网企业的管理者发出处理指示。然后，审查人员就会删除那些观点太过偏离党的路线的热门评论或账号。
"""We have seen this with a lot of cases in the past decade where these kinds of local grievances escalate to a national agenda,"" Mr. Fu said.","""我们在过去十年的很多案例中都看到了地方矛盾上升为全国议题的情况，""傅景华说。"
"The outpouring of concern over violence against women has created competing pressures for Chinese officials, who need to be seen as though they are taking action. Wary of any dissent they cannot control, the officials have moved to narrow the space for debate. These tactics were recently used to manipulate discussions around one of China's highest-profile #MeToo cases.","对暴力侵害女性行为的大量关注给中国官员带来了矛盾的压力，他们得做出正在采取行动的样子。由于担心出现无法控制的异议，官员们已经开始收窄讨论的空间。这些策略最近也被用来操纵关于中国最受关注的""#我也是""案件之一的讨论。"
"In August, Zhou Xiaoxuan, an outspoken activist, lost her appeal against Zhu Jun, a famous TV anchor she accused of sexual assault. When Ms. Zhou, who is also known by her nickname, Xianzi, first came forward in 2018, her case inspired women to speak out about their own experiences being harassed. Throngs of supporters came to see her at the courthouse. Not long after, Ms. Zhou was barred from Weibo, a popular social media platform. Positive comments about her were removed.",8月，大胆敢言的维权人士周晓璇诉著名电视主持人朱军的二审败诉。又名弦子的周晓璇在2018年第一次站出来发声时，她的案件激发了女性说出自己被骚扰的经历。大批支持者来到法院见她。不久之后，周晓璇就被禁用微博。对她的正面评价被删除。
"""The government doesn't want people to create hashtags to freely discuss #MeToo,"" said Liu Lipeng, who worked at Weibo from 2011 to 2013. He said he had been part of a team of around 200 censors ordered by the government to scrub commentary from feminists.","2011年至2013年在微博工作的刘力朋说:""官方不想让网民随便建hashtag来自由讨论MeToo。""他说，政府下令一个由200人左右组成的审查团队清除女权主义者的评论，他是团队的一员。"
"""After the government sets the tone, Weibo immediately deletes posts that are inconsistent,"" Mr. Liu added.","刘力朋还说:""在官方定调后，微博立刻把和官方定调不一致的给删掉。"""
"At her first trial, judges ruled that Ms. Zhou had failed to present enough evidence against Mr. Zhu. A similar verdict was delivered on Aug. 10 during an appeal. Ms. Zhou argued that the judges had given her few chances to detail her allegations and had rejected her lawyer's attempts to introduce supporting evidence.",在一审中，法官裁定周晓璇未能提供足够的证据指证朱军。8月10日的二审作出了类似的判决。周晓璇辩称，法官几乎没有给她机会详细说明她的指控，并拒绝了她的律师引入支持证据的尝试。
"""Is it true that if sexual harassment occurs in a closed space, as long as the other party completely denies it, and as long as there is no video recording of the whole process, the woman can only be silent and cannot seek justice in the court?"" Ms. Zhou asked while reading a statement to a small group of supporters outside the courthouse in August.","8月，周晓璇在法庭外向一小群支持者宣读一份声明时问道:""是否发生在封闭空间的性骚扰，只要对方全盘否认，只要没有全程录像，受害的女性就只能沉默以对，而无法在司法上求得正义?"""
"She was scolded by critics online who accused her of making up ""small stories"" that had ruined Mr. Zhu's life. Government censors used Weibo to boost the comments supporting the court's decision against Ms. Zhou while drowning out and deleting messages praising her.","她在网上遭到批评者的责骂，指责她编造了毁掉朱军一生的""小作文""。政府审查人员利用微博来加强支持法院判周晓璇败诉的评论，同时掩盖并删除了赞扬她的信息。"
"Mr. Zhu never appeared in court, but ""outside the court, Zhu Jun was protected by censorship,"" said Huang Simin, a human rights lawyer who has worked on cases involving gender violence in China. Ms. Zhou, however, ""was censored no matter how much she wanted to speak up,"" Ms. Huang said. ""She became invisible and absent.""","朱军从未出庭，但""在法庭外，朱军是被审查所保护的""，曾在中国处理涉及性别暴力案件的人权律师黄思敏说。然而，周晓璇""无论她多么想发声，她的声音都被审查噤声了""，黄思敏说。""她是不可见的、缺席的。"""
Mr. Zhu has denied the allegations and has sued Ms. Zhou for defamation. Weibo and WeChat declined to respond to requests for comment.,朱军否认了这些指控，并以诽谤罪起诉了周晓璇。微博和微信均拒绝回应置评请求。
"The subject of women's rights has become increasingly sensitive in China as the country's top leader, Xi Jinping, encourages more women to embrace traditional gender roles and have more babies to help address a looming demographic crisis. Women who push back on or question the party's authority by citing gender inequality are seen as troublemakers.",随着中国最高领导人习近平鼓励更多女性接受传统的性别角色并生育更多的孩子，以帮助解决迫在眉睫的人口危机，女性权利的话题在中国变得越来越敏感。以性别不平等为由反对或质疑党的权威的女性被视为麻烦制造者。
"Peng Shuai, one of China's most famous tennis stars, suddenly disappeared from the internet and the public for weeks after she accused a top party member of sexual assault last year. More recently, the censors were busy after a group of men brutally beat several women at a restaurant in the Chinese city of Tangshan in June, leaving two of the women hospitalized.",中国最著名的网球明星之一彭帅在去年指控一名党内高官性侵，而后突然从互联网和公众视野中消失了数周。不久前的6月，在中国唐山市的一家餐馆里，一群男子残忍地殴打了几名女性，导致其中两名女性住院，事发后审查人员则忙于处理舆论。
"Video footage of the attack quickly spread online, horrifying viewers and prompting questions about the sexist attitudes that allowed such violent behavior to occur. Soon, though, other voices downplayed that gender played a role at all. The story, critics said, was about public safety.",打人视频在网上迅速传播，令人们感到震惊，并促使人们对导致这种暴力行为发生的性别歧视态度提出质疑。不过很快，其他声音就淡化了性别在其中发挥的作用。批评人士说，这起事件是关于公共安全的。
"In the days that followed, state media focused on the importance of rooting out gang-related violence in China. Online comments calling the attack ""merely gang-related"" were promoted. Those that pointed to sexism were muted. Weibo shut down more than 1,000 accounts. Among them were those that the company claimed were ""inciting conflict between the genders.""","在随后的日子里，官方媒体重点关注在中国铲除与有组织犯罪有关的暴力行为。网上评论称这只是一起""涉黑""袭击。那些指出性别歧视的人被噤声。微博关闭了1000多个账号。其中包括那些被微博称为""煽动两性对立""的账号。"
"Last week, after the authorities charged 28 people with 11 different crimes following an investigation, the Chinese state media broadcaster CCTV released an 11-minute segment that heavily featured police officers describing what took place during the beating. One of the victims briefly appeared in the segment, also describing what happened.",周一，当局在进行调查后以11项罪名指控28人，中国官方媒体中央电视台随后发布了一段11分钟的节目，其中大部分时间是警察在讲述打人事件中到底发生了什么。其中一名受害者短暂出现在片段中，也描述了当时的情况。
"But when the narrator asked about possible sexual assault, the segment cut to a male officer who dismissed the question, calling such suggestions ""fabricated false information."" Until now, the public had not yet heard from any of the victims. The same is true of a woman who was found in January, tied to the wall with a metal chain around her neck.","但当叙述者询问可能的性侵犯时，节目该部分切入一名男性警官，他驳斥了这个问题，称这些建议是""捏造的虚假信息""。到目前为止，公众尚未收到任何来自受害者的消息。关于在1月被发现的那名脖子上拴着铁链的女性，公众也没有再听到任何关于她的消息。"
"A video of the woman went viral, setting off a search by citizen journalists to find her. People online doubted the government's narrative that she was a mentally ill mother. Many were concerned that she had been a victim of human trafficking.","""铁链女""的视频在网上疯传，促使公民记者发起搜寻以找到她。政府说她是一名患有精神障碍的母亲，网上的人对此表示质疑。许多人担心她是人口贩卖的受害者。"
"Yet when activists tried to visit the woman to give her an opportunity to tell her story, the activists were detained and beaten by local authorities. Their social media accounts were taken down. Others who tried to share posts from the activists about the chained woman were harassed by the police.","然而，当活动人士试图探访这名女性，让她有机会讲述自己的故事时，这些活动人士遭到地方当局的拘留和殴打。他们的社交媒体账号被封禁。其他人试图分享活动人士发出的关于""铁链女""的帖子，却受到了警察的骚扰。"
"Such stories have been discouraging for women like He Qian, a former journalist who came forward several years ago with accusations of sexual assault against a well-known reporter. The court's ruling in the case focused on defamation of the accused, ordered Ms. He to pay damages and led to a discussion about how the man Ms. He had identified, Deng Fei, was made ""socially dead"" because of her accusations.","这样的故事让像何谦这样的女性感到沮丧，她曾是一名记者，几年前站了出来，指控一名知名记者对她进行性侵犯。法院对该案的裁决重点是被告受到的诽谤，责令何谦支付赔偿金，并引发了一场关于被告邓飞是如何因何谦的指控而""社会性死亡""的讨论。"
Mr. Deng has denied the accusations and won the appeal that Ms. He pursued this year. Lawyers in China now publicize services to defend men accused of sexual harassment.,邓飞否认了这些指控，并在何谦今年提出的上诉案中胜诉。中国的律师现在把为被指控性骚扰的男性辩护作为宣传的卖点。
"""Our society is now in a very conflicted state,"" Ms. He said. On the one hand, the public is more aware of the gendered aspect to cases of violence, she said. But on the other hand, ""the misogynistic ideas are increasing.""","""我们的社会现在处于非常矛盾的状态，""何谦说。她说，一方面，公众更加了解暴力案件中的性别问题。但另一方面，""更多厌女的人的观念不断被加强。"""

"BEIJING A strong earthquake shook a mountainous, steep-sloped area in southwestern China on Monday, and local government agencies said on Tuesday morning that at least 65 people had been killed and more than 250 others were injured.At least 12 people were said to be missing.",北京——周一午后不久，中国西南部一个陡峭的山区发生强烈地震，当地政府机构周二表示，至少有65人遇难，250多人受伤。另有12人据称失踪。
"The full extent of the damage remained unclear at nightfall, however, as the quake damaged communications in the remote, isolated region. In a sign that damage might be heavy, Xi Jinping, China's leader, personally ordered that the government ""spare no effort to rescue the affected people,"" state television announced Monday evening.","由于偏远地区的通讯遭到破坏，至入夜时分，此次地震造成灾害的严重程度仍未能得到充分了解。国家电视台周一晚间宣布，中国领导人习近平亲自下令政府""全力救援受灾群众""，这表明损失可能很严重。"
"The China Earthquakes Networks Center initially estimated the earthquake as having a magnitude of 6.6, but it later revised that upward to 6.8. The epicenter was fairly shallow about 10 miles below the Earth's surface and shallow earthquakes often produce more damage than those far underground.",中国地震台网中心最初估计地震震级为6.6级，但后来经修正升至6.8级。震源非常浅——大约在地表以下16千米——浅层地震通常比来自深处的地震造成的破坏更大。
"The epicenter was in Luding County, a remote area with many ethnic Tibetans in the southwestern corner of Sichuan Province, close to that province's borders with Tibet to the west and Yunnan Province to the south. The U.S. Geological Service gave the precise location of the epicenter as several miles east of the Dadu River, which runs through a series of rapids and past small towns in a steep-flanked valley.",震中位于四川省西南部的泸定县，这是一个藏族众多的偏远地区，接近四川省界，西邻西藏自治区，南接云南省。美国地质局给出的震中准确位置在大渡河以东几公里处。有多处湍流的大渡河流经陡峭山谷中的几个小镇。
"Satellite maps indicate a topography somewhat similar to the area of northern Sichuan Province where a much more powerful earthquake struck less than three months before the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The earlier earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.9, killed at least 69,000 people, including thousands of children who died when their schools collapsed.",卫星地图显示的地形有些类似于2008年发生强烈地震的四川省北部地区，当时距离北京夏季奥运会还有不到三个月。那次7.9级地震造成至少6.9万人死亡，其中包括数千名因校舍倒塌而丧生的儿童。
Many landslides blocked steep mountain valleys and roads during the earlier earthquake. Relief workers needed several days to reach some communities where people had been buried alive.,在那次地震中，许多山体滑坡阻塞了陡峭的山谷和道路。救援人员需要几天时间才能到达一些人们被活埋的社区。
"The Chinese Army dropped 15 paratroopers into one isolated area, but deaths and injuries among these troops as they fell into dense trees prompted the government to refrain from further such efforts. Those difficulties helped persuade China to undertake a large program to import helicopters and to start building many more of its own helicopters.",当时中国军队将15名伞兵投送到一个与外界隔绝的地区，但这些部队因落入茂密的树林而出现伤亡，使得政府不再进一步采取此类行动。这些困难推动中国实施了一项进口直升机的大型计划，并开始制造更多自己的直升机。
"The earthquake on Monday is the latest in a series of troubles to afflict Sichuan Province in the past month. Local authorities locked down the province's huge capital, Chengdu, with 21 million people, last Thursday in an attempt to control a Covid-19 outbreak.",过去一个月，四川省遭遇了一系列麻烦，周一的地震是最新一起。上周四，地方当局封锁了拥有2100万人口的省会成都，试图控制新冠疫情。
"From late June to late August the province also endured its worst heat wave on record, and the usual summer rains failed to arrive. A severe drought not only parched farms but left so little water in rivers that the province's huge hydroelectric dams could not generate nearly as much electricity as usual.",从6月下旬到8月下旬，该省还经历了有记录以来最严重的热浪，且夏季降雨没有像往常一样到来。严重的干旱不仅使农田干涸，还导致河流水量大幅减少，以至于该省的巨大水电大坝无法像往常一样发电。
"That led to the closure of many factories for nearly two weeks in late August, as well as blackouts that left residents without electricity for air conditioning as temperatures repeatedly soared past 100 degrees. Some rain finally reached the province last week, but not enough to end the drought.",这导致许多工厂在8月下旬关闭了近两周，并导致停电，令居民在气温反复飙升至37度以上的天气里无法使用空调。上周，四川终于出现降雨，但还不足以结束干旱。
"In the hours before the southern Chinese city of Chengdu entered a coronavirus lockdown, Matthew Chen visited four vegetable markets in an attempt to stock up on fresh food. But seemingly the entire city had the same idea, and by the time he got to each place, most of the shelves had been stripped bare, except for hot peppers and fruit, he said.",在中国成都进入新冠病毒封控状态的几小时前，马修·陈为囤积新鲜食品去了四家菜市场。但似乎整个城市的人都有同样的想法，等他到了菜市场的时候，大多数货架都已空空如也，除了辣椒和水果，他说。
"Mr. Chen, a white-collar worker in his 30s, managed to scavenge enough cherry tomatoes, meat and greens for about one day, and since then has been ordering grocery deliveries to tide him through the lockdown, which began on Friday. But he worries about whether that supply will remain stable, and how much longer he will have to rely on it.",马修·陈30多岁，从事白领工作，他设法买到了够吃一天的樱桃小番茄、肉类和绿叶菜，从那以后，他一直网购食品来帮助度过上周五开始的封控。但他担心网上的供应是否会保持稳定，也担心他还需要依赖网购多久。
"""The longer a lockdown goes, the more problems emerge, and the harder it is to tolerate it,"" he said, noting that the Chengdu government had not given a timeline for reopening.","""封城这种事情，就是越往后，问题越大. 时间越久，心理越难以忍受，""他说，并指出，成都市政府没有告诉人们何时解封。"
"Problems have already appeared. Some residents have complained on social media of long delays in food deliveries. Over the weekend, Chengdu's Covid testing system which has been tasked with swabbing all of the city's 21 million residents every day collapsed, leaving residents waiting in line for hours.",问题已经出现了。一些居民已在社交媒体上抱怨食品配送延误时间太长。上周末，负责每天为全市2100万居民做检测的成都新冠病毒检测系统崩溃，导致居民排队的时间长达好几个小时。
"Similar scenes of uncertainty and anxiety are playing out across China, as the country battles a new wave of coronavirus outbreaks, with cases recorded over the past week in nearly every province. The authorities have responded with the lockdowns and mass testing that have come to define the country's ""zero Covid"" policy.","几乎每个省份都在过去一周里录得感染病例，随着中国与新一轮新冠病毒疫情作斗争，类似的不确定性和焦虑场景正在各地上演。当局的应对措施是封锁和大规模检测，这些做法已成为中国""清零""政策的定义。"
"The number of infections remains relatively small, with about 1,500 new cases on Sunday. Yet some 60 million people across China are facing partial or full lockdowns, according to Chinese media, from Chengdu to the southern economic powerhouse of Shenzhen to the oil-producing city of Daqing near Russia.",中国的感染人数仍相对较少，全国周日通报的新感染病例约为1500例。然而，据中国媒体报道，中国各地约有6000万人处于部分或全面封控状态，从成都到南方经济重镇深圳，再到俄罗斯附近的石油城市大庆。
"The challenges in enforcing such extensive controls are daunting, perhaps more so now than at any other point in the pandemic. Nearly three years of on-and-off lockdowns have lashed the economy, sending unemployment soaring, especially among young people. The country is increasingly isolated, as the rest of the world largely abandons Covid restrictions. New subvariants are ever more transmissible. And the seemingly endless restrictions leave more ordinary Chinese people wearier by the day.",执行如此广泛的封控措施所面临的挑战是艰巨的，而目前的挑战可能比新冠病毒大流行以来的任何时候都大。接近三年断断续续的封控冲击了经济，导致失业率飙升，尤其是在年轻人中。随着世界其他国家大都放宽了因新冠病毒采取的限制措施，中国在世界上越来越孤立。新变异株的传染性越来越强。看似永无止境的封控让更多的普通中国人日益厌倦。
"But the stakes have also reached new heights. The ruling Communist Party is scheduled to hold an important congress on Oct. 16, where China's leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to claim a third term. Mr. Xi has given his personal imprimatur to ""zero Covid,"" casting it as proof of the party's strength and by extension, his own leadership. Any local official seen as weakening that claim could face serious consequences.","但利害关系也达到了新的高度。执政的中共将在10月16日召开重要的全国代表大会，预计中国领导人习近平届时将获得第三个任期。""清零""政策已得到习近平本人的认可，他把这个政策描述为中共意志力量的证明，进而延伸到他本人领导力的证明，任何被视为削弱这一主张的地方官员都会面临严重后果。"
"The overriding imperative of wiping out infections was evident in the speed with which cities moved to shut down recently, despite the huge economic and social toll.",几座城市最近采取封控措施的速度之快充分显示了消除感染是压倒一切的当务之急，尽管封控已带来了巨大的经济和社会代价。
"Chengdu on Sunday announced that it would continue the stay-at-home orders and daily universal testing that began on Friday for at least three more days, as the situation remained ""serious and complicated."" It did not say whether the lockdown would end afterward.","成都周日宣布，由于疫情仍然""复杂严峻""，将继续命令居民待在家中，并继续每天对全体市民进行病毒检测，这些做法于上周五开始，将持续至少三天。成都政府没有说封控是否会在三天后结束。"
"The restrictions are certain to strain Chengdu's economy. Even before the lockdown, the city had banned large-scale gatherings, leading to the cancellation of an international auto show that last year generated nearly $1 billion in sales.",这些限制措施肯定给成都经济带来压力。甚至在封控之前，成都就已禁止了大规模聚集性活动，导致去年销售额近10亿美元的国际车展被取消。
"The shutdown also follows a recent drought, record-breaking heat and power outages last month that had led to factory closures across Sichuan Province, where Chengdu is the capital. The heat may in fact have exacerbated the virus's spread: Several major clusters were linked to swimming pools where people had gone to cool off, according to state media.",封控发生在上个月的干旱、创纪录的高温天气和停电限电之后，天气问题曾导致四川省各地的很多工厂停工。高温天气实际上可能加剧了病毒的传播:据官方媒体报道，几个主要的聚集性感染与人们去游泳池降温有关。
"To many, the panic buying in Chengdu underscored how deeply previous lockdowns especially the grueling two-month shutdown of Shanghai earlier this year had shaken people. Though Chengdu officials have tried to reassure residents that food supplies are ample, Shanghai had offered similar assurances, only to see widespread reported shortages of food and medicine.",对许多人来说，成都的恐慌性抢购凸显了之前的封控——尤其是今年早些时候上海长达两个月的艰苦封控——给人们造成了多大的震撼。尽管成都官员试图让居民放心，称食品供应充足，但上海也曾做出类似的保证，结果却出现了普遍的食品和药品短缺的报道。
"Chengdu officials themselves have already tested residents' trust, after the authorities last week ordered a man detained for 15 days, accusing him of spreading false rumors on social media about a looming lockdown. Two days later, when the city did actually lock down, social media erupted with support for the man and anger at the government.",成都官员的行为已经考验了居民的信任。上周，有关部门下令对一名男子行政拘留15天，当局指控他在社交媒体上散布有关即将实施封城的虚假谣言。两天后，成都真的实行了封控，社交媒体上爆发了对该男子的支持和对政府的愤怒。
"""Everyone is scared, scared that the situation will become like Shanghai,"" said Mr. Chen, the office worker, who had traveled to Chengdu on business before becoming trapped there by the restrictions.","""大家就是怕，怕出现像上海那种情况，""从事白领工作的马修·陈说。他在成都封控之前来这里出差，现在被封控困在了成都。"
"Still, he saw little alternative but to bear with the situation. ""Personally, I'm extremely fed up with and not supportive of these policies. But there's nothing I can do,"" he said. ""I can only wait.""","尽管如此，他认为除了忍受外几乎别无选择。""我个人是很鄙视，很讨厌，很不支持这些政策的，""他说。""只能等。"""
"The drive for zero cases at all costs has also led to widespread shutdowns in Shenzhen, one of China's most economically vital metropolises, home to major tech companies, including Tencent and Huawei. There, the local authorities over the weekend ordered most of the city's 18 million residents to stay at home, postponed the start of the school year and shuttered most public transit, after detecting about 400 cases in the past week.",不惜一切代价清零的努力也在深圳引发了大范围封控。深圳是中国最重要的经济大都市之一，是腾讯和华为等大型技术企业总部的所在地。当地政府在周末下令深圳1800万居民中的大多数待在家里，学校推迟开学，大部分公共交通停运，因为在过去一周里发现了约400个病例。
"Lockdowns are being extended in parts of Hainan Province and in the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, major vacation destinations where flare-ups of infections last month led to thousands of tourists being trapped in their hotels, sometimes at their own expense. Over the weekend, at least 33 cities were under some form of restrictions, according to Caixin, a Chinese news outlet.",海南省部分地区以及新疆和西藏地区的封控正在延长，这些度假胜地上月暴发的新冠疫情导致数千名游客被困酒店，有时还得自己付费。据中国新闻媒体财新报道，周末期间，至少有33座城市处于某种形式的封控措施下。
"As the restrictions have spread across the country, so has public discontent. In Chengdu, the testing failures prompted a flurry of outrage at the company responsible, with online commenters noting that certain sectors focused on Covid control were profiting while regular people were suffering economically. Testing companies have reported soaring revenue in public filings.",随着限制措施扩大到全国各地，公众的不满情绪也在蔓延。成都病毒检测系统的崩溃引发了对责任公司的公愤，网上的评论者指出，在老百姓因封控遭受经济损失的时候，与新冠病毒封控有关的一些行业正在盈利。在提交的公开文件中，病毒检测公司报告的收入在飙升。
"In Daqing, a city of nearly three million people in China's northeast that has been locked down for about two weeks, local officials promised to investigate widely shared social media reports of a pregnant woman who miscarried after being denied medical care because of Covid restrictions.",有近300万人口的中国东北城市大庆采取封控措施已有约两周时间，当地官员承诺对社交媒体上广泛流传的一条报道进行调查，报道称一名孕妇因新冠病毒限制措施被拒诊后流产。
"Even the government appears to have tacitly acknowledged that people's patience is fraying. In many of the cities recently sealed off, officials have gone to great lengths not to call the measures a lockdown. In Shenzhen, local officials described the weekend requirements only as universal testing then added that residents should immediately return home afterward. The Chengdu announcement said residents would ""in principle stay at home.""","就连政府似乎也知道人们的耐心正在耗尽。在许多最近采取封控措施的城市，官员们竭尽全力不把这些措施称为封控。深圳的地方官员只是把周末的要求描述为""全区全员核酸检测""，然后补充说，居民在做检测后应该立即回家。成都的公告称，全体居民应""原则居家""。"
"On the social media platform Weibo, the hashtag ""Chengdu lockdown"" has been censored.","在社交媒体平台微博上，""成都封城""的标签已被审查。"
"Still, no matter what new terms officials use, this experience feels familiar to Freya Yang, a college student from Chengdu. She spent the spring almost entirely unable to leave her campus in Beijing. Now, after going home for the summer, she can't go back to school and is missing the start of her senior year.",尽管如此，不管官员们使用什么新术语，这种经历对来自成都的大学生弗雷娅·杨来说很熟悉。整个春天，她几乎无法离开在北京的校园。现在，回家过完暑假后，她不能返回学校，错过了大四的开学时间。
"""Everyone only knows what they're going through, which is that you can't go outside,"" Ms. Yang said. ""These word games, people don't really care about them.""","""大家只知道落在自己头上这个事情是什么样的，那就是不能出门，""弗雷娅·杨说。""语言上的这么一些游戏，大家都不是特别在乎。"""
"China has locked down Chengdu, one of its biggest and economically important cities, as it turns once again to its Covid strategy of restricting people's movements to stop outbreaks.",中国再次采用限制人员流动以阻止疫情暴发的新冠战略，封锁了成都，这是该国最大城市之一，也是经济重地。
"Starting at 6 p.m. on Thursday, residents in the city of more than 21 million were no longer allowed to leave their homes without special permission, in the most drastic move to stop an outbreak since Shanghai went into a damaging two-month lockdown in April. Authorities also began citywide mass testing that they said would continue through the weekend. Chengdu reported 157 cases on Wednesday and more than 700 cases since Aug. 25.",周四下午6点开始，这座拥有超过2100万人口的城市的居民在没有特别许可的情况下不能离家，自4月上海为期两个月的破坏性封锁以来，这是为遏制疫情而采取的最激烈举措。当局还开始在全市范围内进行大规模核酸检测，并表示检测将持续到周末。成都周三报告了157例病例，自8月25日以来累计病例已达700多例。
"China is the last major country in the world to pursue a policy of eradicating the virus, and it uses citywide lockdowns and mass testing to root out pockets of outbreaks. But the approach is adding to the pressures facing the local authorities in Sichuan, the southern province whose capital is Chengdu. A record-setting drought and a punishing heat wave have devastated the region's power supply, and emergency responders battled quick-moving wildfires around the city of Chongqing until late last week.",中国是世界上最后一个奉行根除新冠病毒政策的大国，采取封城和大规模检测的方式来消除疫情。但这种做法增加了省会城市成都所在的四川省地方当局面临的压力。创纪录的干旱和严重的热浪压垮了该地区的电力供应，直到上周晚些时候，应急响应人员还在重庆市周围与快速蔓延的野火作斗争。
"These troubles come as the ruling Communist Party is also dealing with an economic slowdown, caused largely by its so-called zero-Covid policy, at a politically sensitive time. The country's top leader, Xi Jinping, is readying himself to take a third term in power next month.",执政的共产党不但要应对这些麻烦，还要应对由清零政策造成的经济放缓，而且目前正处于政治敏感时期。该国最高领导人习近平正准备在下个月获得第三个任期。
"Officials in Chengdu gave no indication of how long the lockdown might last, but it is expected to deal another economic blow to China at a challenging moment. The city is home to the manufacturing and assembly plants of several multinational automakers and technology firms including Intel, VW and Toyota, and its economic growth in 2021 accounted for 1.7 percent of China's overall gross domestic product.",成都的官员没有说明封城可能持续多长时间，但人们预计封城将在这一充满挑战的时刻对中国再次造成经济打击。该市是英特尔、大众和丰田等多家跨国汽车制造商及科技公司的制造和装配厂所在地，2021年其经济增长占中国整体国内生产总值的1.7%。
"China's southwestern region had fared relatively well over nearly three years of the pandemic. But in recent weeks several places have fought to beat back new outbreaks, including the megacity of Chongqing. Millions of residents there waited for hours in the hot sun and extreme heat while officials carried out mass testing last week.",在大流行的近三年里，中国西南地区情况相对较好。但最近几周，包括大城市重庆在内的几个地方都在努力遏制新的疫情暴发。上周，官员开展大规模核酸检测，成都数百万居民在烈日和酷暑中经历数小时的排队等待。
Chengdu and other cities across China have ordered measures like postponing the start of school and shutting down businesses to try to stamp out stubborn outbreaks in recent days.,最近几天，成都和中国其他城市已下令采取延迟开学和关闭企业等措施，试图遏制顽固的疫情。
"The southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, tightened restrictions on millions of people, and closed down shops, entertainment clubs and swimming pools. Authorities shut down the world's biggest electronics market in the city on Monday and suspended service on much of the city's subway system.",与香港相邻的深圳对数百万人收紧限制，关闭了商店、娱乐场所和游泳池。深圳拥有全球最大的电子产品市场，当局在周一关闭该市场，并暂停了该市大部分地铁系统的服务。
"China's strict lockdown approach is also beginning to exact a social toll, too.",中国严格的封锁措施也开始对社会造成损失。
"People turned to Chinese social media to vent about the news of the lockdown after officials in Chengdu denied rumors of one. In Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai, parents of young children have complained online about onerous requirements that they provide daily nucleic acid tests results for students.",在成都官员否认封城传言后，人们转向中国社交媒体来发泄对封城消息的不满。在深圳、成都和上海，家长们纷纷在网上抱怨提供学生每日核酸检测结果的繁琐要求。
"Images online showed some Chengdu residents trying to flee the city and others scrambling to prepare for the lockdown. Videos posted to Weibo, a popular social media platform, showed crowds of residents in outdoor markets and supermarkets, rushing to stock up on food.",网上图片显示，一些成都居民试图逃离这座城市，还有人争先恐后地为封城做准备。在微博上发布的视频显示，户外市场和超市里聚集了争相囤积食物的大量居民。
"Hong Kong reported 10,586 cases on Thursday, the most since an outbreak in the spring that led to some of the city's toughest restrictions of the pandemic and that prompted an exodus of expatriates. Officials are now trying a more lenient approach, diverging from China's broader pandemic strategy for the first time. They eased the required hotel quarantine for those returning from overseas twice this summer.",香港周四报告了10586例病例，这是自春季疫情以来的最高值，该次疫情导致香港采取了一些最严格的防疫措施，并导致外籍人士外流。官员们现在正在尝试一种较为宽松的方法，首次偏离了中国更广泛的防疫策略。今年夏天，香港两次放宽了对海外返港人员的酒店隔离要求。
"HONG KONG At first China said there was ""no such thing"" as re-education centers that held vast numbers of people in its far western Xinjiang region. Then, as more reports emerged that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and members of other largely Muslim groups were being detained, Beijing acknowledged the camps' existence but described them as vocational training centers.","香港——起初，中国否认在其新疆西部偏远地区建设大规模拘禁营，称""不存在再教育营这种东西""。后来，随着更多有关几十万名维吾尔人和其他主要是穆斯林的少数民族成员被拘禁的报道出现，中国政府承认了拘禁营的存在，但将它们描述为职业培训中心。"
"When overseas Uyghurs spoke out about the authorities' abuses in Xinjiang, China targeted their families back home, sentencing their relatives to long prison terms and using the full weight of state media and prominent Chinese diplomats to denounce the activists as liars and frauds.",当海外维吾尔人公开批评中国当局在新疆的暴行时，中国将他们在国内的亲属作为打击目标，将他们的家人判处长期徒刑，并动用官方媒体和中国著名外交官的全部力量，谴责这些活动人士是撒谎者和骗子。
"For the many Uyghur activists who have campaigned often at great personal cost to bring China's intense crackdown in Xinjiang to light, a United Nations report released on Wednesday that largely validated their claims was a powerful, if long-delayed, vindication.",对许多一直努力揭露中国在新疆的严厉镇压、并常常为此付出巨大个人代价的维吾尔活动人士来说，联合国周三发布的新疆人权报告基本肯定了他们的说法，为他们的可靠性提供了强有力、尽管拖延已久的证明。
"The 48-page report, which said that China had committed grave human rights abuses in Xinjiang, sharply undercuts Beijing's aggressive efforts to discredit Uyghurs who dared to speak out. It also gives new momentum to the Uyghur activists' cause and an opportunity for rights campaigners to put the issue before the U.N. Human Rights Council later this month and increase pressure on businesses to distance themselves from China.",这份48页的报告称中国在新疆严重侵犯人权，它大大削弱了中国政府为诋毁敢于发声的维吾尔人所做的积极努力。报告也为维吾尔活动人士的事业提供了新动力，并为人权活动人士提供了机会，使他们能够在本月晚些时候将新疆人权问题提交给联合国人权理事会，并加大对企业的压力，使它们与中国保持距离。
"""As I was reading the entire report, I was fighting back tears,"" said Rayhan Asat, a Uyghur lawyer in Washington whose brother, Ekpar, was sentenced in 2020 to 15 years in prison in Xinjiang. ""It was a long-awaited recognition of the suffering of my brother and millions like him.""","""我读整篇报告时，强忍住泪水，""华盛顿的维吾尔律师莱汉·阿萨特说，她弟弟伊克帕于2020年被新疆当局判处15年监禁。""它承认了我弟弟和数百万像他那样的人的痛苦，我们为此期待已久。"""
"Many overseas Uyghurs and other activists had doubted that the United Nations office would release such a forceful report, given Beijing's growing influence over the international body and the reluctance of Michelle Bachelet, who stepped down on Wednesday as the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, to criticize China.",许多海外维吾尔人和其他人权活动人士曾对联合国人权办是否会发布一份措辞如此有力的报告表示怀疑。因为中国在这个国际机构的影响力越来越大，而且联合国人权事务高级专员米歇尔·巴切莱特一直不愿批评中国。(她已在周三卸任。)
"But in the final minutes of her term in office, Ms. Bachelet's office released a document that said China's crackdown in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity, a stark assessment that surprised some critics who felt her office was increasingly willing to pull its punches in exchange for access and better ties with Beijing.",但在她任期的最后几分钟，巴切莱特的办公室发布了一份文件，称中国在新疆的镇压可能构成危害人类罪，这个严厉的评估令一些批评者感到惊讶，他们曾觉得她的办公室越来越不愿出手，以换取同中国政府保持接触以及更好的关系。
"""I am heartened that courageous survivors' voices were given their deserved weight,"" said Ms. Asat, the lawyer in Washington. She said that it was difficult to read some sections of the report, which described credible reports of torture, mistreatment and sexual assault while in custody.","""幸存者的勇敢发声得到了应有的重视，我深受鼓舞，""华盛顿的律师阿萨特说。她说，报告的某些部分让人不忍卒读，其中描述了在拘禁期间遭受酷刑、虐待和性侵犯的可信报道。"
"""I know my brother was subject to brutal torture and all sorts of inhumane treatment,"" she said, referring to his experience when he was in internment camps for three years until 2019. ""I try not to think about it. It's self-defeating and doesn't help me remain vigilant about why I'm fighting.""","""我知道我弟弟遭受了残暴的酷刑和各种不人道的待遇，""她说，她指的是弟弟直到2019年被关在拘禁营的三年经历。""我尽量不去想它。想太多了适得其反，不能帮助我对自己为何而战保持决心。"""
"Activists said they had grown increasingly concerned during Ms. Bachelet's final days in her job, when she hinted that the report, which had already been delayed for nearly a year, might not come out before she left. China had urged her office not to release the document and submitted lengthy replies after the government was shown a draft, per the standard procedure of the U.N. office.",活动人士说，他们在巴切莱特任期的最后几天里越来越担心，因为她曾暗示，这份已经推迟了近一年的报告可能不会在她卸任之前发布。中国政府曾敦促她的办公室不要发布这份文件，并在收到报告草稿后，按照联合国人权办的标准程序，提交了一份冗长的回复。
"The United Nations attached China's 131-page response as an annex. It called the report a ""so-called 'assessment"" that was ""based on disinformation and lies.""","联合国把中国提交的131页的回复作为附录附上，它称该报告是""基于虚假信息和谎言的所谓'评估'""。"
"While several Uyghur activists said it would have been useful to see the report far earlier, they hoped its release would give added weight to a campaign that they say has been eclipsed by the coronavirus pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other international issues.",虽然一些维吾尔活动人士说早点看到这份报告会更有帮助，但他们希望报告的发布能增加人们对他们运动的支持，他们说，新冠病毒大流行、俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，以及其他国际问题，已让新疆人权问题淡出了人们的视线。
"""Hopefully, it will ignite another fire, and so it will get more attention from other countries, other NGOs and the U.N. and there will be more action to stop it,"" said Ferkat Jawdat, a Uyghur in Virginia whose mother was imprisoned in Xinjiang and now is in isolation at her home in Urumqi, the regional capital.","""希望报告会重新燃起人们的怒火，让它得到其他国家、其他非政府组织和联合国的更多关注，为阻止新疆人权问题的继续采取更多的行动，""现居美国弗吉尼亚州的维吾尔人法卡特·乔达特说，她母亲曾被关在新疆的监狱，现在独自一人被隔离在首府乌鲁木齐家中。"
"Some activists remained critical of the U.N. human rights organization, saying it did not go far enough in pushing China for accountability. They noted it did not call the repression in Xinjiang a ""genocide,"" a conclusion reached by the United States and an unofficial tribunal in Britain, even as the report outlined components of such an assessment, including a ""stark"" decline of Uyghur birthrates, the destruction of shrines and mosques and curbs on Uyghur language instruction.","一些活动人士仍对联合国人权办持批评态度，认为其在追究中国的责任上走得不够远。他们指出，联合国人权办没有把中国在新疆的镇压称为""种族灭绝""，这是美国和英国的一个非官方法庭得出的结论，尽管人权办的报告概述了构成""种族灭绝""的部分内容，包括维吾尔族出生率""急剧""下降，圣地和清真寺被毁，维吾尔语的教学被限制。"
"""Despite well-documented evidence of state-sponsored torture and the intended destruction of the entire Uyghur ethnic groups through massive concentration camps, physical and mental torture, slave labor, massive displacement, enforced sterilization to prevent population growth and separation of children from their parents, the U.N. report came short of calling the crime by name,"" said Mehmet Tohti, executive director of the Ottawa-based Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project. ""It seems to me that the report has gone through serious haircuts.""","""尽管有充分的证据证明存在国家支持的酷刑，以及通过大规模集中营、身体和心理折磨、奴役劳动、大规模人口迁移、强制绝育以防止人口增长、将儿童与父母分离等手段，意图毁灭整个维吾尔族的罪行，联合国的报告却没有使用这个罪名，""渥太华维吾尔权利倡导项目执行主任穆罕默德·土赫提说。""在我看来，这份报告经过了严重的删减。"""
"Still, for the those who have seen their family members imprisoned and themselves attacked publicly by the Chinese state, the report offers a victory, even as it falls short of their goal of freedom for their relatives.",尽管如此，对于那些看到家人被关入监狱、自己则被中国政府公开攻击的人来说，这份报告是个胜利，尽管报告没有达到为他们的亲人争取自由的目标。
"The report gives evidence to China's critics that they can take before the Human Rights Council, the United Nations' leading rights body, to push for greater accountability. Rights groups have called on the council to set up formal mechanisms to investigate China for violations of international law and identify those responsible, although Beijing and nations that support it could thwart such an effort.",该报告为中国的批评者提供了证据，让他们可以在联合国的主要权利机构人权理事会上提出，以推动更大的问责。人权组织已呼吁人权理事会建立调查中国违反国际法行为的正式机制，确定责任人，尽管中国政府以及支持中国的国家可能会阻挠这种努力。
"""It is imperative that nations take this report and make concrete steps toward stopping these crimes against humanity and holding China accountable for them,"" said Rushan Abbas, a Uyghur American activist and former Defense Department translator whose sister was sentenced to 20 years in prison in apparent retaliation for Ms. Abbas's efforts to speak out about the repression in Xinjiang.","""各国接受这份报告，采取具体步骤制止这些危害人类的罪行，让中国为这些罪行承担责任，这是当务之急，""美籍维吾尔活动人士、曾在美国国防部担任翻译的鲁珊·阿巴斯说，她姐姐在2018年被中国当局判处20年有期徒刑，显然是为了报复阿巴斯公开批评新疆镇压的努力。"
"""I hope that the U.N. will use their influence and position to advocate for the freedom of all the innocent Uyghurs like my loving sister.""","""我希望联合国使用其影响力和地位，为我亲爱的姐姐和所有像她那样的无辜维吾尔人争取自由。"""
