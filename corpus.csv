"The indictment of former President Donald J. Trump on federal criminal charges is a first for the United States, but such cases have become fairly common globally. In the past two decades, several dozen nations have prosecuted a former head of government or head of state.",前总统特朗普遭联邦刑事指控，对美国来说前所未有，但在全球范围内已相当普遍。在过去的20年里，几十个国家对前政府首脑或国家元首提起过公诉。
"And while Mr. Trump's allies have said repeatedly that such charges he was also indicted on separate state charges in New York in March are the work of a ""banana republic,"" several of the cases have occurred in countries that routinely rank among the world's freest, most democratic and wealthiest.","虽然特朗普的盟友一再表示此类指控——他还于3月因另一项州指控被纽约州起诉——是""香蕉共和国""的做法，但其中一些案例发生在通常被列为世界上最自由、民主和富有的国家。"
"In just the past 15 years, Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac of France, Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak of South Korea and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy have all been prosecuted for corruption and found guilty. The list of those criminally charged also includes former democratically elected leaders of Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa and Taiwan.",仅仅在过去的15年里，法国的萨科齐和希拉克，韩国的朴槿惠和李明博，意大利的贝卢斯科尼都因腐败被起诉并被判有罪。受刑事指控的名单还包括阿根廷、巴西、巴基斯坦、秘鲁、南非和台湾的前民选领导人。
"In the 1980s, Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister of Japan, was convicted. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is currently on trial on corruption charges.",80年代，日本前首相田中角荣被定罪。以色列总理内塔尼亚胡目前正因腐败指控接受审判。
"""It's always a big deal when a former president or prime minister is indicted, but in most democracies, it is normal when they're credibly accused of serious crimes,"" said Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard who has written about dozens of countries' transition to democracy. The United States, he said, has been an outlier in its reluctance to charge a former leader.","""前总统或总理被起诉始终都是一件大事，但在大多数民主国家，有理有据地指控他们犯有严重罪行是很正常的，""哈佛大学政府学教授史蒂文·莱维茨基说，他曾就数十个国家的民主过渡撰写文章。他说，美国是个例外，它不愿指控其前领导人。"
"""Political systems have to handle it,"" he added. ""They have to. Because the alternative saying some people are above the law is much worse.""","""政治制度必须予以处理，""他还说。""他们必须这样做。因为另一个选择要更糟糕，即表示有些人可以凌驾于法律之上。"""
"Prosecutions can reflect that the rule of law is strong, that even the powerful are not above the courts and can be held to account. But they can also show that the rule of law is weak, that the legal system is easily weaponized against political enemies.",公诉可以反映法治的强健，即使是有权势的人也不能凌驾于法庭之上，并且可以被追究责任。但这些起诉也可能表明法治薄弱，即法律体系很容易被当成对付政敌的武器。
"""Many people are going to immediately assume that it's for political reasons, and it's going to be very hard, if not impossible, to persuade them that it's a legitimate, nonpolitical prosecution,"" said John B. Bellinger III, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and a top legal official during President George W. Bush's administration.","""很多人会立即假设这是出于政治原因，而且要说服他们这是合法的、非政治性的起诉，即使不是不可能，也是非常困难的，""华盛顿外交关系委员会兼任高级研究员、曾在乔治·W·布什政府中主管法务的约翰·B·贝林杰三世说。"
"That reaction is likely to be more severe, political scientists say, in a country where politics are highly polarized and partisan. If the defendant's political allies are willing to see how the legal process plays out rather than jump to the accused leader's defense, claims of prosecutorial bias typically gain less traction.",政治学家说，在一个政治高度两极化和党派化的国家，这种反应可能会更加严重。如果被告的政治盟友愿意静待法律程序给出结果，而不是直接为被指控的领导人辩护，那么检控偏误的说法通常不会获得多少关注。
"Nathalie Tocci, an Italian political scientist, has some sobering advice for well-meaning prosecutors weighing such cases: ""I don't think you can get it right.""","意大利政治学家纳塔莉·托奇给那些怀着良好动机考虑此类诉讼的检察官泼了冷水:""我不认为你能把这事办好。"""
That is not the same as advising against it.,这与不建议起诉是有区别的。
"""If you think, legally speaking, there was a crime and you have to proceed, you just do it,"" Ms. Tocci said. ""But there's always a justice story and a politics story, and one should try to keep them separated, but it's impossible.""","""如果你认为法律上讲存在犯罪并且你必须推进，你就去做，""托奇说。""但这种事永远有司法和政治两个层面，人们应该尽量将它们分开，但那是不可能的。"""
"Authoritarian leaders have historically repressed their opponents without much concern for even the appearance of due process. But in recent years, dozens of such governments have instead used courts, with verdicts foreordained, to publicly condemn their ousted adversaries and frighten others into submission.",历史上的威权领导人向来会镇压他们的对手，连表面上的程序正义都无需太顾忌。但近年来，数十个这样的政府转而利用法院，用预先决定了的判决去公开谴责被赶下台的对手，并恐吓其他人就范。
"It is in democracies, where public opinion matters more and there is at least some expectation of impartial justice, that a prosecutor's job is most delicate. The evenhanded application of the law can be painted as political retribution, and vice versa, putting added pressure on prosecutors deciding whether to proceed.",检察官的工作在民主国家是最为棘手的，因为在这些国家，公众舆论更重要，并且对公正司法至少有一定的期望。法律的公正适用可能被描绘成政治报复，反之亦然，给检察官决定是否进行诉讼增加了压力。
"Mr. Berlusconi, a three-time prime minister, has been prosecuted several times, was convicted of tax fraud, has had other guilty verdicts overturned on appeal and has escaped other charges only by having the laws changed.",曾三度担任总理的贝卢斯科尼多次被公诉，被判犯有税务欺诈罪，其他有罪判决通过上诉被推翻，还有一些指控是通过修改法律逃脱的。
"Through it all, he has, like Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump, spent years portraying himself as a victim persecuted by an out-of-control and politicized system, using that claim to rally his supporters, surviving scandal after scandal.",自始至终，他都像内塔尼亚胡和特朗普一样，花了数年时间将自己描绘成一个被失控且政治化的制度迫害的受害者，利用这一说法来团结他的支持者，在一个接一个的丑闻中幸存下来。
"That combination, Ms. Tocci said, can do serious damage to public faith in the justice system the defendant's supporters see the system as illegitimate, while the leader's opponents see it as ineffectual.",托奇说，这些情况结合起来会严重损害公众对司法系统的信心——被告的支持者认为司法系统名不正言不顺，而领导人的反对者则认为它不起作用。
"""If there is an acquittal, it can be proof that the justice system worked,"" she said, ""but people will claim that it was all about nothing and it was politically driven.""","""如果判决无罪，就可以证明司法系统发挥了作用，""她说，""但人们会声称这一切都是无中生有，是出于政治目的。"""
"Yet, she added, ""Looking at the Berlusconi cases, I would still say it was right to do it, even if it made no difference, even if it prolonged his political life.""","然而，她还说，""考虑到贝卢斯科尼的案例，我仍然会说这样做是正确的，即使没有改变什么，即使这延长了他的政治生命。"""
"Legal experts point to ample ethical gray areas. A prosecution can center on what may be a real crime, yet still be politically motivated or be open to question.",法律专家指出了大量的道德灰色地带。指控可能是围绕着真正的犯罪，但仍然可以具有政治动机或值得被怀疑。
"Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil was convicted of money laundering and corruption, but the country's top court threw out the charges in 2021 because of bias by the judge, after it was revealed that the jurist had extensive improper, private communication with the prosecutors, consulting with them on strategy. Mr. Lula was released from prison after 19 months, ran again for president last year and won.",巴西的路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦被判洗钱和腐败罪名成立，但该国最高法院在2021年因法官的偏见而驳回了这些指控，此前有消息称这位法官与检察官进行了大量不正当的私下沟通，与他们就策略进行磋商。卢拉在19个月后出狱，去年再次竞选总统并获胜。
Another murky area involves forms of corruption that are practiced widely and with impunity.,另一个不明朗的领域涉及被广泛采用且不受惩罚的腐败形式。
"Justin Vaisse, a historian and former official in France's Foreign Affairs Ministry, said that Mr. Lula ""broke some rules and principles, but everybody did the same thing and others were probably doing worse,"" making him what some called a target of politically motivated selective prosecution.","前法国外交部官员、历史学家贾斯汀·瓦伊斯表示，卢拉""违反了一些规则和原则，但所有人都是这么做的，有的甚至更加恶劣""，这使他成为一些人所说的出于政治动机的针对性起诉的目标。"
"Mr. Chirac, he added, fell not to ""weaponization of the legal system,"" but to shifting ethical standards. After serving as president of France, Mr. Chirac was convicted of creating fake jobs for political allies when he was mayor of Paris decades earlier.","他还说，希拉克没有受制于""法律体系的武器化""，而是栽在操守准则的转变上。希拉克在卸任法国总统后被定罪，是因为他在几十年前担任巴黎市长时为政治盟友设立了虚假官职。"
"""Some of the things that Chirac did had been common practice at the time,"" Mr. Vaisse said.","""希拉克所做的一些事情在当时是司空见惯的，""瓦伊斯说。"
"To ensure fairness or the appearance of fairness prosecutors, like judges, should be ""insulated from political pressures,"" Mr. Bellinger said, adding that ""as best as possible,"" they themselves should be apolitical.","贝林格说，为确保公平——或表面上的公平——检察官和法官一样，应该""不受政治压力的影响""。他还说，他们自己应该""尽可能地""去政治化。"
"He acknowledged that it was hard for officials to convince the public of their impartiality when they face constant accusations of bias and when they are appointed by elected officeholders or are, themselves, elected.",他承认，当官员们不断被指责有偏见，以及当他们由民选公职人员任命或他们自己就是通过民选上任时，很难让公众相信他们的公正性。
"But those challenges, as difficult as they are, cannot dissuade the justice system from taking on legitimate cases against political leaders, he and other experts said.",但他和其他专家表示，即使面临如此艰巨的挑战，司法系统也应该敢于推进针对政治领导人的合理案件。
"""People will throw potshots at the process any time they're arrested; that is common,"" Mr. Levitsky said. ""But if you rob a bank and I arrest you, and you threaten to throw a hand grenade at the courthouse, the problem is not that I arrested you for robbing a bank.""","""人在被捕的时候总是会对司法程序发起肆意的攻击，这很常见，""莱维茨基说。""但如果你抢了一家银行，我逮捕了你，你威胁要向法院扔手榴弹，那么错不在我因为你抢劫银行而逮捕你。"""
Canada on Wednesday was struggling to fight an extraordinary outbreak of wildfires across the country that sent smoke pouring over the border and forced millions of Canadians and Americans to stay indoors as skies darkened over large portions of both nations.,周三，加拿大正在努力扑灭在全国各地爆发的一场反常的野火，滚滚浓烟越过边境，迫使数以百万计加拿大人和美国人待在室内，两国很大部分地区变得暗无天日。
"Over 400 fires burned in Canada, and blazes this year have already scorched roughly 9.8 million acres of forest more than 10 times the acreage that had burned by this time last year, officials say sending smoke billowing down the east coast of the United States, from New York past Washington, D.C., and as far west as Minnesota.",今年，加拿大发生了400多起火灾，大火已经烧毁了大约3.9万公顷的森林——官员们说，这是去年同期被烧毁森林面积的10倍以上——美国东海岸浓烟滚滚，从纽约经过华盛顿特区，一直向西到明尼苏达州。
"In Canada, a country known for its picturesque landscapes and orderliness, the out-of-control wildfires have stoked national anxiety. They have also stretched firefighting resources in a sprawling and decentralized country where firefighting is managed at the provincial level, and made coordination more difficult at a time when global warming has intensified the wildfire season.",在以风景如画和秩序井然著称的加拿大，失控的野火引发了全国人民的焦虑。在一个庞大而分散的国家，消防工作由省级管理，野火令消防资源紧张，并在全球变暖加剧野火季的情况下，使协调工作变得更加困难。
"In Ottawa, the capital, the feeling of a country under siege was highlighted on Wednesday by the sight of a thick haze hovering over Parliament Hill and over the soaring Gothic Revival building that is part of Canada's Parliament in Ottawa.",周三，在加拿大首都渥太华，浓浓的雾霾笼罩在议会山和加拿大议会大楼高耸的哥特复兴式建筑上空，令人感觉整个国家已被重重包围。
"The effects from the Canadian wildfires stunned the United States. Smoke obscured the New York City skyline on Wednesday, turning the outlines of its skyscrapers into ghostly silhouettes.",加拿大野火还波及到了美国。周三，烟雾笼罩了纽约市的天际线，将摩天大楼的轮廓变成了幽灵般的剪影。
Climate research suggests that heat and drought associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires in Canada.,气候研究表明，加拿大出现越来越多更大、更猛的火灾主要是因为与全球变暖相关的高温和干旱。
"Canada has the world's largest intact forest ecosystem. Drought and high heat, which many parts of the country have experienced recently, can make trees vulnerable to fire and dry out dead grass, pine needles, and any other material on the bottom of the forest floor that act as kindling when a fire sweeps through a forest.",加拿大拥有世界上最大的完整森林生态系统。该国许多地区最近都经历了干旱和高温，可能使树木更容易起火，并使枯草、松针和森林地面底部的任何其他物质更干燥，它们在火灾席卷森林时会起到引火作用。
"Wildfire experts see the signs of climate change in the dryness, intense heat and longer fire season that have made these fires more extreme.",野火专家从干燥、酷热和更长的火季中看到了气候变化的迹象，这使得这些火灾更加极端。
"Across a swath of North America, commuters slipped on Covid masks to walk the streets, schools canceled field trips and some closed, flights were canceled and officials urged millions of people to stay indoors as smoke blotted out the sun.",在北美的大片地区，随着阳光被烟雾所遮挡，通勤者戴着口罩走在街上，学校取消了野外教学项目，一些学校关闭了，航班被取消，官员们敦促数以百万计的人待在室内。
"In Canada, the wildfires have exerted a heavy human toll, including displacing tens of thousands of people. The level of unpredictability caused by the blazes is so high that provincial wildfire authorities in British Columbia have warned local residents to have a go-bag at the ready, along with an evacuation plan.",在加拿大，野火造成了严重的人员伤亡，包括令数万人流离失所。大火造成的不可预测性非常高，因此不列颠哥伦比亚省负责管理野火的有关部门警告当地居民准备好应急行李，并制定撤离计划。
"Millions of Canadians in Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal woke up Wednesday to a haze of smoke over large sections of their cities, as wildfires expanded to places that had previously felt largely immune to fires blazing in faraway provinces.",周三，渥太华、多伦多和蒙特利尔的数以百万加拿大人醒来发现，他们所在城市的大部分地区都笼罩在烟雾中。野火蔓延到一些此前被认为基本不会受到大火影响的偏远省份。
"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said that hundreds of soldiers had been deployed across the country to help with firefighting efforts. ""Unfortunately over the past years, we've seen extreme weather events increase in their intensity and their impact on Canadians as well as on their cost to families, to provinces and to the federal budget,"" Mr. Trudeau said.","加拿大总理贾斯汀·特鲁多表示，已经在全国各地部署了数百名士兵协助灭火工作。""不幸的是，在过去几年里，我们看到极端天气事件的强度在增加，对加拿大人的影响也在增加，给家庭、各省和联邦预算造成的损失也在增加，""特鲁多说。"
"An apocalyptic haze in shades of beige thickened over northeastern U.S. cities throughout the day on Wednesday, drawing out anxieties about climate change from everyday New Yorkers and health warnings from Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York and Mayor Eric Adams of New York City.",周三全天，美国东北部城市笼罩在深浅不一的微黄色阴霾中，如同末日一般，引发了纽约百姓对气候变化的担忧，纽约州州长凯西·霍格尔和纽约市市长埃里克·亚当斯发出了健康警告。
"In the cities most affected, including Buffalo and Binghamton in upstate New York, thick clouds of orange plunged the area into unusually cold temperatures, as conditions worsened across the northeast. Schools in New York City and Washington, D.C., canceled outdoor activities for the day, zoos in New York closed early out of concern for the animals, and Philadelphia warned residents to stay inside.",在受影响最严重的城市，包括纽约州北部的布法罗和宾厄姆顿，厚厚的橙色云层使该地区出现反常的低温，整个东北地区的情况也在恶化。纽约市和华盛顿的学校取消了当天的户外活动，纽约的动物园为保护动物提前关闭，费城警告居民留在室内。
"The smoke and poor air quality also led to the cancellation of various cultural performances and sporting events, including a Yankees game in the Bronx and a Phillies game in Philadelphia. As smoke seeped into theaters in New York City, alarming both ticket holders and performers, the Broadway production of ""Hamilton"" and a Free Shakespeare in the Park production of ""Hamlet"" both canceled performances.","烟雾和糟糕的空气质量还导致各种文化表演和体育赛事被取消，包括在布朗克斯的洋基队和费城的费城人队的比赛。随着烟雾渗入纽约市的剧院，观众和表演者都感到恐慌，百老汇的《汉密尔顿》和""公园里的免费莎士比亚""的《哈姆雷特》都取消了演出。"
"""People are scared to come out in this smoke,"" said Remy Hernandez, 40, a Bronx resident who delivers food orders for Uber Eats and DoorDash. ""To me it looks like the world is ending.""","""人们不敢冒着浓烟出来，""40岁的布朗克斯居民、为Uber Eats和DoorDash送外卖的雷米·埃尔南德斯说。""我觉得就像是世界末日。"""
"The hazy conditions in New York are likely to continue on Thursday and Friday, and could linger over the weekend, according to Basil Seggos, the commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. On Wednesday, he told reporters that clearing the skies would take an act of God. ""We'll pray for rains up north and for winds to shift,"" he said.","纽约州环境保护部部长巴兹尔·塞戈斯表示，纽约的雾霾状况可能会在周四和周五持续，并可能持续到周末。周三，他告诉记者，清理天空需要上帝的行动。他说:""我们将祈祷北方下雨，祈求风向转变。"""
Much of New York State was under an air quality health advisory alert that was to remain in effect until Wednesday night.,纽约州大部分地区都处于空气质量健康预警状态，该警报将持续到周三晚上。
"By Wednesday afternoon, the air quality index in the broader New York City region surpassed 400, the worst since the Environmental Protection Agency began recording air quality measurements in 1999.",截至周三下午，纽约市整个地区的空气质量指数超过了400，这是美国环境保护局自1999年开始记录空气质量数据以来的最差水平。
"Such a reading indicates that the air is unhealthy for all people, not just the vulnerable, and is somewhat typical in smoggy megacities like Jakarta or New Delhi. But it is unusual for New York City, where decades of state and federal laws have helped reduce emissions and clear the air, especially in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods.",这样的读数表明，空气对所有人都是不健康的，而不仅仅是弱势群体。这在雅加达或新德里等雾霾大城市是很典型的情况，但对纽约市来说是不寻常的，几十年来，纽约的州和联邦法律一直在促进减少排放和净化空气，尤其是在中上层社区。
"The scope and scale of the wildfires in Canada have underscored the challenges of fighting fires in a vast country. Wildfire emergency response management is handled by each of the 10 provinces and three territories in Canada, but hundreds of blazes across the country have stretched local resources thin, and renewed calls for a national firefighting service.",加拿大野火的范围和规模凸显了在一个幅员辽阔的国家扑灭火灾的挑战。野火应急管理应由加拿大的十个省和三个地区各自负责，但全国各地数以百计的大火已经使当地资源捉襟见肘，令人们再次呼吁建立国家消防服务。
"""It is rare to see this much wildfire nationally across Canada, all at the same time,"" said Rob Schweitzer, executive director, of BC Wildfire Services in British Columbia. ""In the past provinces have been able to share resources but now that is under strain given the amount of fire on the landscape.""","""在加拿大全国范围内同时看到这么多的野火是很罕见的，""不列颠哥伦比亚省BC野火服务机构的执行董事罗布·施韦策说。""在过去，各省能够共享资源，但现在，考虑到大火的数量，这种共享面临压力。"""
"Richard Cannings, a member of parliament with the New Democratic Party, said wildfire activity had made it imperative to keep a national stockpile of equipment, such as a squadron of water bombers, that could quickly be deployed.",新民主党议员理查德·坎宁斯说，野火频发之下，应尽快建立国家装备储备，包括筹建一支灭火飞机队，可以随时部署到灾区。
"Speaking with reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Trudeau did not address the call for a national firefighting service, but said that his government was considering creating a federal disaster response organization. ""We need to continue to make sure we are doing everything possible to both keep Canadians safe when these extreme weather events hit, but also make sure we're doing everything we can to predict, protect and act ahead of more of these events coming.""","周三接受记者采访时，特鲁多没有就建立国家消防部门的呼吁做出回应，但是他说，他的政府在考虑成立一个联邦灾害反应机构。""我们需要继续确保在极端天气来临时，尽一切可能保障加拿大人民的安全，同时也要确保尽一切可能在此类灾害发生前做出预判、保护和反应。"""
"Firefighters from the United States, South Africa, France, Australia and New Zealand, along with members of the Canadian Armed Forces, were supporting overwhelmed local fire crews.",来自美国、南非、法国、澳大利亚和新西兰的消防员以及加拿大武装部队人员正在支援不堪重负的地方消防队。
"Over the past few weeks, wildfires in Canada have stretched nearly 2,900 miles from British Columbia on the west coast to Nova Scotia in the east, convulsing the country, causing fears about lost livelihoods, burning down properties and endangering health.",过去几周里，从西海岸的不列颠哥伦比亚到东部的新斯科舍，加拿大野火已经席卷了将近4700公里，令举国震动，人们担心因此失去生计、房产被毁乃至危及身体健康。
"Health authorities have warned that fire smoke could cause symptoms ranging from sore and watery eyes to coughing, dizziness, chest pains and heart palpitations. Some health officials have advised residents to wear protective masks, conjuring bad memories of pandemic times.",卫生部门警告，烟雾可能导致从眼部刺痛、流泪到咳嗽、眩晕、胸痛和心悸等许多症状。一些卫生官员建议居民佩戴保护性口罩，从而激起大流行时代的痛苦回忆。
"Ms. Hochul, of New York, said the state was releasing 1 million N-95 masks from its stockpile to be given out at public places like parks and subway stations.",纽约州的霍格尔称，州府将从储备中拿出100万只N-95口罩，在公园、地铁站等公共场所发放。
"Meteorologists said they expected the plume of smoke buffeting Toronto, the country's largest city and its financial capital, to worsen on Thursday because of winds, and Environment Canada warned residents to brace for worsening air quality.",气象学家估计，由于风势影响，目前吞没了加拿大最大城市和金融中心多伦多的烟雾到周四还会恶化，加拿大环境部提醒居民为更糟糕的空气做好准备。
"In Ottawa, the Ottawa Redblacks, the city's Canadian Football League team, switched from outdoor to indoor practice. And in Toronto, the Blue Jays announced that they would close their domed stadiums for a game against the Houston Astros Wednesday night.",在渥太华，该市的全加足联球队渥太华红黑队已经改在室内训练。在多伦多，蓝鸟队宣布周三晚对阵休斯顿太空人队的比赛期间将关闭球场顶棚。
"The wildfires were also hurting businesses, with many mining companies suspending operations in Quebec.",野火还在造成商业损失，许多矿业公司停止了在魁北克的运营。
"The wildfires have rattled British Columbia and Alberta, an oil and gas producing province, for weeks. Roughly 29,000 people were evacuated from Alberta, a number that had fallen on Wednesday to 3,900. On the east coast of Canada, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, a wildfire late last month forced the evacuation of more than 16,000 people.",几周来，野火让石油天然气大省不列颠哥伦比亚和艾伯塔陷入不安。艾伯塔疏散了大约2.9万人，到周三降到了3900人。在加拿大东海岸新斯科舍省的哈利法克斯，上月底的一场野火迫使超过1.6万人撤离。
"In Ottawa on Wednesday, Bogdan Wozniak, 72, a distraught hot-dog stand vendor, said his business had always been weather dependent, but smoke or fire were other-level challenges. ""For smoke you cannot be prepared,"" he said. ""You have the mask,"" he said. ""That's all.""","周三在渥太华，72岁的热狗摊主博格丹·沃兹尼亚克忧心忡忡地说，他的生意向来很受天气的影响，但那跟野火带来的挑战一比就不算什么了。""烟雾要来，没什么可准备的，""他说。""顶多也就是戴个口罩。"""
"""I'll be lucky if I break even today,"" he added.","""今天能回本就很不错了，""他接着说。"
"After ""Glory to Hong Kong"" emerged as the unofficial anthem of pro-democracy demonstrators in 2019, the government of Hong Kong has tried to stifle its use. It has banned the song from schools. When it was played in error last year instead of the Chinese national anthem at a rugby match in South Korea, the Hong Kong government demanded an investigation.",《愿荣光归香港》在2019年的民主抗议活动中成为示威者的非官方国歌后，香港政府一直试图将其禁止。当局已在学校将其列为禁歌。韩国去年举行亚洲七人橄榄球赛时错误地演奏这首歌而不是中国国歌之后，香港政府曾要求进行调查。
"This week the authorities asked a court to ban the public performance and online dissemination of ""Glory to Hong Kong."" The move could ensnare U.S. technology companies like Google and set up the first legal test of how much control the Hong Kong government can wield over online content.",本周，当局向法庭申请禁止公开表演、在网上传播《愿荣光归香港》。 这个做法可能会使谷歌等美国科技公司陷入困境，这也是香港政府对网络内容控制能力的首次法庭检验。
"Hong Kong is seeking to prohibit the distribution or reproduction of the song ""in any way,"" including adaptations of its ""melody or lyrics,"" the government said in a statement on Tuesday. It said that the song had been used to ""insult"" the Chinese national anthem, ""The March of the Volunteers,"" causing ""serious damage to the country"" and to Hong Kong. A date for the court to hear the request has not been set.","香港政府在周二的新闻公报中称，正在寻求禁止""以任何方式""发布或复制这首歌，包括""有关歌曲的改编本""。当局称，这首歌对中国国歌《义勇军进行曲》""造成侮辱，对国家和特区造成严重损害""。法庭听取申请的日期尚未确定。"
The Hong Kong authorities had previously criticized Google for displaying the protest song under search results for Hong Kong's national anthem.,"香港当局此前曾批评谷歌，在其平台上搜索""香港国歌""时，得到的结果包括这首抗议歌曲。"
"""We've already sent a request to Google to pin the correct national anthem but, regrettably, Google refused,"" said Chris Tang, the Hong Kong security secretary, at a news conference in December. ""I find this explanation unthinkable and the Hong Kong people will not tolerate it.""","""我们已向谷歌提出要求，将国歌正确置顶，可惜被谷歌拒绝，""香港保安局局长邓炳强在去年12月的记者会上说。""我相信这个说法匪夷所思，香港人不会接受。"""
"The government's request for a court injunction against the protest song, made on Monday, is the latest attempt by Hong Kong to root out the remaining vestiges of political dissent in the city, a former British colony that once enjoyed more political autonomy. Under China's president, Xi Jinping, Hong Kong has undergone a stark shift from its days as a prosperous hub for foreign businesses to a frontier in Beijing's campaign to safeguard national security.",政府在本周一向法庭申请了禁止播放或传播这首抗议歌曲的禁制令，这是当局为根除香港残留的政治异见所采取的最新尝试，香港曾是英国殖民地，有过更多的政治自治权。在中国国家主席习近平领导下，香港已发生了巨大的变化，从以前对外国企业友好的繁荣中心，变成了中国政府维护国家安全运动的前沿阵地。
"Last week, an annual vigil held on the anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing was shut down by officers, who arrested and detained protesters and suspected mourners.","上周，香港警方叫停每年为纪念1989年北京天安门广场民主运动举行的""六四""守夜活动，逮捕并拘留了抗议者和疑似悼念者。"
"In applying for the court injunction against the Hong Kong protest anthem, the government cites its national security law, which was enacted in 2020 and gave Beijing sweeping powers to crack down on what it deemed to be political crimes, including separatism and collusion.",香港政府向法院申请针对抗议歌曲的禁制令时，引用了2020年颁布的《香港国安法》，该法赋予中国政府广泛权力，来打击它认为的政治犯罪，包括分裂国家、勾结外国势力在内。
"If granted, a court injunction would likely make moderating content in Hong Kong more complicated and expensive for U.S. tech companies, said George Chen, managing director for the consulting firm The Asia Group and former head of public policy for Greater China at Meta. He said the government's decision to use the courts was ""opening the flood gates.""","如果申请得到批准，禁制令可能会使在香港运营的美国科技企业审核网上内容变得更复杂、成本也更高，咨询公司亚洲集团董事总经理、曾任Meta大中华区公共政策负责人的陈澍说。他称政府利用法庭的决定是""在打开闸门""。"
"""Glory to Hong Kong"" can be found in Hong Kong on such platforms as Meta's Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which is owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet.",在香港搜索《愿荣光归香港》时，用户在Meta的Facebook、Twitter，以及谷歌母公司Alphabet旗下的YouTube等平台上都能找到结果。
"According to Ming Pao, a centrist Chinese-language newspaper, the court application cited 32 links on YouTube related to the song.",据中间派中文报纸《明报》报道，政府提交给法庭的申请提到了YouTube上与这首歌有关的32个链接。
Google and Meta declined to comment. Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.,谷歌和Meta拒绝为本文置评。Twitter没有回应置评请求。
"U.S. technology companies typically follow the rules of the countries and regions where they operate and, at times, remove content. The potential scope of an injunction in Hong Kong was not clear. Critics say the national security law was written with the intent of policing conduct even outside of Hong Kong.",美国科技企业通常遵守其运营所在国家和地区的法律法规，有时会删除内容。香港禁制令可能的适用范围目前不清楚。批评人士说，《香港国安法》的制定是以监管香港以外的行为为目的的。
"""Anyone in the world can violate the Hong Kong national security law,"" said Lokman Tsui, former head of free expression for Asia Pacific at Google. ""The question is whether this injunction is similar in scope.""","""世界任何地方的人都能违反《香港国安法》，""曾任谷歌亚太地区言论自由部门负责人的徐洛文说。""问题是这项禁制令的适用范围上是否与国安法相似。"""
"Refusal to comply with a decision by a Hong Kong court could endanger a company's staff and business in the region, Mr. Tsui added.",拒绝遵守香港法院的裁决会危及公司在该地区的员工和业务，徐洛文补充说。
"For now, the efforts to suppress the song appear to have driven a wave of interest in it: On Wednesday, eight different versions of ""Glory to Hong Kong"" topped the singles charts of iTunes in Hong Kong.",就目前而言，压制这首抗议歌曲的努力似乎引发了人们对它的兴趣:八个不同版本的《愿荣光归香港》在香港的iTunes单曲榜上名列前茅。
"For years, even as China has been largely closed off to foreign internet companies, Hong Kong remained an exceptiona hub where foreign businesses could operate relatively free of the censorship controls they would face on the mainland.",多年来，尽管中国在很大程度上屏蔽了外国互联网公司的网站，但香港仍是例外——外国企业可以在这里相对自由地运营，不受他们在大陆面临的那些审查控制。
"The escalation of the Hong Kong government's efforts to proscribe speech could further damage the city's image as a financial and economic center for China and Asia, said Willy Lam, a senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation, a think tank in Washington. ""We've already seen many multinational businesses move their personnel to Singapore and other places, now there will be less multinationals choosing to base themselves in Hong Kong.""","香港政府升级限制言论的努力可能会进一步损害香港作为中国、乃至亚洲金融和经济中心的形象，华盛顿智库詹姆斯敦基金会高级研究员林和立说。 ""我们已经看到很多跨国企业将人员转移到新加坡和其他地方，现在选择落户香港的跨国公司将越来越少。"""
"""This is another nail in the coffin for Hong Kong,"" he added.","""这是导致香港失败的又一个做法，""他补充说。"
"For decades, Hong Kong was the only place in China where the victims of the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy activists at Tiananmen Square in Beijing could be publicly mourned in a candlelight vigil. This year, Hong Kong is notable for all the ways it is being made to forget the 1989 massacre.","数十年来，香港曾是中国唯一能公开纪念""六四""的地方，人们用烛光守夜悼念1989年北京天安门广场民主运动中被军队镇压的罹难者。今年，香港以各种方式让人民忘记1989年大屠杀的做法引人注目。"
"In the days before the June 4 anniversary on Sunday, even small shops that displayed items alluding to the crackdown were closely monitored, receiving multiple visits from the police. Over the weekend, thousands of officers patrolled the streets in the Causeway Bay district, where the vigil was normally held, and set up tents where they searched people suspected of trying to mourn. They arrested four people accused of ""acts with seditious intention"" and detained four others.","今年的""六四""是周日，几天前，就连展示暗指镇压的物品的小商店也会受到严密监视，警方多次上门走访。周末，数千名警察在以前举行守夜活动的铜锣湾街头巡逻，还搭了临时帐篷，对涉嫌试图哀悼的人进行搜查。警察以涉嫌""作出具煽动意图的作为""逮捕了四人，并拘留了另外四人。"
"Zhou Fengsuo, a student leader in the Tiananmen Square protest movement, said that Hong Kong is now under the same ""despotic rule"" as the mainland.","天安门广场抗议运动的学生领袖周锋锁说，香港现在与内地一样处于""暴政""之下。"
"""Back in 1989, we did not realize the mission of a democratic China,"" said Mr. Zhou, now the executive director of Human Rights in China, a New York advocacy group. ""Afterward, Hong Kong protests faced the same suppression, the same vilification and erasure of memories.""","""我们在89年没有完成中国民主化的使命，""周锋锁说，他现任纽约倡导组织""中国人权""的执行主任。""到后来香港的抗遭遇到了同样的镇压，同样的污名化和抹去记忆的这个过程都是非常类似的。"""
"In 1989, the democracy movement in China drew huge support from Hong Kong, then a British colony. After the Chinese military cleared student protesters occupying Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds and possibly thousands, some student leaders in Beijing were smuggled to safety via Hong Kong.",1989年的那场民主运动在当时仍是英国殖民地的香港赢得大力支持。中国军队开枪打死了数百甚至数千人、清除了占领天安门广场的学生抗议者后，北京的一些学生领袖偷渡香港逃到了安全地方。
"Every June 4 for three decades, Victoria Park in Hong Kong was where Tiananmen Mothers, a group representing victims of the massacre, could openly grieve and express hopes for a freer China. The gatherings drew crowds of tens of thousands of people, even as in the past decade some of the city's younger generation of activists questioned the relevance of the mainland-focused movement as they embraced a distinct Hong Kong identity.","在那之后的三十多年里，代表大屠杀受害者的团体——""天安门母亲""曾于每年""六四""在香港的维多利亚公园举行公开的悼念活动，表达对一个更自由中国的希望。每年的烛光集会曾吸引成千上万的民众，尽管过去十年来，一些接受独特香港身份认同的年轻一代活动人士开始怀疑这场以内地为中心的运动是否具有相关性。"
"But since China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, virtually all forms of dissent have been criminalized in the city. Pro-democracy and antigovernment protests like those that roiled the city in 2019 have been snuffed out.",但自从中央政府2020年对香港实施国家安全法以来，几乎所有形式的异见在这座城市都成了犯罪。类似于2019年那场席卷香港的亲民主和反政府抗议活动已被扼杀。
"The authorities have paid particular attention to commemorations of the Tiananmen massacre. They raided a museum dedicated to it, removed books about the crackdown from libraries and imprisoned organizers of vigils.","当局对天安门大屠杀的纪念活动尤为关注。他们突击搜查了一个专门纪念""六四""的博物馆，从图书馆拿走了有关镇压的书籍，监禁了守夜活动的组织者。"
"In the past two years, the authorities cited pandemic restrictions to bar all public memorials of the crackdown. Those Covid restrictions were lifted this year, but instead of a Tiananmen vigil, Victoria Park was occupied by a trade fair. The fair was organized by pro-Beijing groups to celebrate the 1997 return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, one month before that anniversary.","过去两年里，当局曾以遏制疫情为由，禁止了所有公开纪念""六四""的活动。虽然今年取消了疫情限制，但维多利亚公园没有""六四""守夜活动，而是被一个市集占据。这个名为""家乡市集嘉年华""的活动是由亲北京的团体组织的，为的是庆祝1997年的香港回归，那个纪念日是在大约一个月后。"
The imprisonment of vigil organizers has raised the question of whether Hong Kong would ever allow residents to peacefully mourn the victims of the Tiananmen massacre.,"""六四""守夜活动组织者被监禁已引发了一个问题，即香港是否还允许民众和平地悼念天安门大屠杀的遇难者。"
"Hong Kong's chief executive, John Lee, has avoided providing a clear answer, saying only that ""everybody should act in accordance with the law and think of what they do, so as to be ready to face the consequences.""","香港行政长官李家超没有明确回答这个问题，只是说""每个人都应该依法行事，想想自己行动时是否有面对后果的准备""。"
"But the arrests on Saturday left little doubt. Among those arrested were Lau Ka-yee, of Tiananmen Mothers, and Kwan Chun-pong, a former vigil volunteer; they were carrying pieces of paper saying they were on a hunger strike as individual mourners. Sanmu Chan, a performance artist, yelled, ""Hong Kongers, don't be afraid! Don't forget June 4,"" as a crush of officers took him away. The police also detained a man and a woman who had carried chrysanthemums and worn white clothing, symbols of mourning.","但周六的逮捕已对这个问题做出了明确的回答。被捕者包括""天安门母亲""运动成员刘家仪和曾为守夜活动当义工的关振邦，他两人手里拿着写有以""禁食""方式做""个人悼念""的白纸。警方还逮捕了行为艺术家陈三木，他高呼""香港人，唔好惊""、""不忘六四""，一群警察向他扑来，将其带走。警方还拘留了一对手持菊花、身穿白色衣服的男女，菊花和白色衣服都象征哀悼。"
"A few more people were taken away by the police on Sunday, including Chan Po-ying, a labor activist; Mak Yin-ting, the former head of a journalist's association; and Alexandra Wong, better known as Grandma Wong, a familiar figure at many protests, often waving a British flag.","周日又有几人被警方带走，其中包括劳工维权人士陈宝莹、前香港记者协会主席麦燕庭，以及人称""王婆婆""的王凤瑶，许多抗议活动中经常有她挥舞着英国国旗的身影。"
"In the lead-up to the anniversary, the authorities were targeting the smallest gestures of remembrance.","在今年""六四""到来之前，当局就已经开始打击那些哪怕最微小的纪念姿态。"
"Debby Chan, a former pro-democracy district official, had posted a few photos on social media of electric candles she displayed in her grocery store last Tuesday. The police and representatives of three different government departments visited her several times because of that, she said. But she was undeterred.",曾任区议会议员的民主派人士陈嘉琳上周二在社交媒体上发了几张她在自家杂货店橱窗展示电蜡烛的照片。她说，警察和来自三个不同政府部门的人已因照片多次来到她店里。但她没有被吓倒。
"""The more we're not allowed to talk about it, the more they make these moves, the more I feel it is the right thing to do,"" she said in a phone interview.","""他们越是不让我们谈论'六四'，越是更多地采取这些做法，我就越觉得我这样做对，""她在接受电话采访时说。"
"To Lit Ming Wai, a playwright, Hong Kong has a responsibility to preserve and pass down the memory of the crackdown, especially as it has been distorted and then erased elsewhere in China.","剧作家列明慧认为，香港有责任保存和传承""六四""镇压的记忆，尤其是这一记忆已在中国其他地方被歪曲、被抹去的情况下。"
"In 2009, she co-founded a community theater group, Stage 64, which sought to make the history of June 4 more accessible for young people in Hong Kong. The troupe's most popular play is ""May 35th"" a euphemism for June 4 that some people on the mainland use to refer to the crackdown.","她曾在2009年与他人共同成立了社区剧团""六四舞台""，为的是让香港的年轻人以更通俗易懂的方式了解""六四""历史。该剧团最受欢迎的剧目是舞台剧《5月35日》，中国大陆的一些人用这个委婉的说法来指代镇压行动。"
"""When we talk about June 4, we are not just thinking about Tiananmen Mothers. Even more, we are thinking of Hong Kong,"" said Ms. Lit, who was an M.C. at June 4 vigils from 2004 to 2014.","""我们谈论'六四'时，想到的不只是天安门母亲。更重要的是，我们也在想香港，""列明慧说道。在2004年到2014年的""六四""守夜活动上，她曾担任主持人。"
"That play can no longer be performed in Hong Kong without risking prosecution. Now based in England, Ms. Lit is seeking to take the play overseas. The play was originally performed in Cantonese and had its Mandarin debut in Taipei, Taiwan, on Friday.",那部舞台剧已不能再在香港上演，否则将面临起诉风险。列明慧现居英国，她正在设法将这部剧带到海外。该剧最初以粤语演出，上周五在台北首次以国语演出。
"""For us Tiananmen survivors, losing Hong Kong this very important place that shielded history and truth is very painful,"" said Mr. Zhou, the former Tiananmen leader. After the raid and forced closing of a June 4 museum in Hong Kong in 2021, Mr. Zhou donated several Tiananmen artifacts to a newly established permanent exhibit in New York, including a bloodstained banner, a tent and a mimeograph. A section was devoted to Hong Kong.","""对于我们'六四'幸存者来讲， 失去香港这样一个最重要的失去香港这样一个最重要的保护历史真相的阵地真的是非常令人痛心的，""天安门抗议运动的学生领袖周锋锁说。2021年，香港的""六四""博物馆遭突袭搜查并被迫关闭后，周锋锁将几件天安门文物赠给了纽约新设立的永久性展览，包括一面血迹斑斑的横幅、一顶帐篷和一台油印机。该展览有一个专为香港设立的展室。"
"He added that he related to the wave of Hong Kong dissidents who had left the city to the pain of exile and their struggle to keep the movement alive while far from home. But their presence abroad was helping to keep the memory of the crackdown alive elsewhere, he said.","周锋锁还说，他理解并同情已经离开香港的一波波异见人士，理解他们流亡的痛苦，以及他们在远离家乡的地方保持运动活力的艰难。虽然他们身在国外，但他们对将""六四""镇压的记忆在其他地方保持下去有帮助，他说。"
"""On the other hand, many Hong Kongers are now passionately participating in June 4 activities around the world, increasing attendance threefold in some places,"" he said. ""There are now many cities that are starting to commemorate June 4 because of the arrival of Hong Kongers.""","""从另外一方面(来看)啊，各地去年都非常明显地看到有新到海外的香港人，他们会热切地加入各地纪念'六四'的活动，很多地方人数都(增加了)三倍以上，""他说。""也有很多城市就是因为香港人的到来(才)开始纪念'六四'。"""
"In a rare victory for journalism amid a crackdown on the news media in Hong Kong, the city's top court on Monday overturned the conviction of a prominent reporter who had produced a documentary that was critical of the police.",周一，香港最高法院推翻了对一名著名记者的定罪，该记者制作了一部批评警方的纪录片。在香港新闻媒体遭受打压之际，这是新闻业的一次罕见胜利。
"Choy Yuk-ling, who also goes by the name Bao Choy, is best known in Hong Kong for producing investigative documentaries examining police conduct in 2019, when the city was roiled by months of antigovernment protests.",蔡玉玲(又名阿包)因制作检视2019年警察行为的调查性纪录片闻名香港，当时该市因数月的反政府抗议活动陷入动荡。
"Among the documentaries she produced was a prizewinning episode of ""Hong Kong Connection,"" a news program by the city's public broadcaster RTHK. The episode examined who was behind a mob attack on a group of protesters and commuters in a train station on July 21, 2019, that left 45 people injured, and why the police were slow to respond.",在她制作的纪录片中，有一集获奖的节目来自香港公共广播公司——香港电台的新闻节目《铿锵集》。这集节目调查了谁是2019年7月21日在地铁站对一群抗议者和通勤者发动暴徒袭击的幕后黑手以及为何警方反应迟缓，这起事件造成45人受伤。
"Ms. Choy had used a public database to look up the license plates of vehicles caught on video transporting the suspected attackers, and traced them to community leaders in Hong Kong's outlying villages. She was arrested in 2020 and found guilty the next year of making false statements to obtain car registry records. A court ordered her to pay a fine of 6,000 Hong Kong dollars, about $775. She later appealed the conviction.",摄像头捕捉到运送袭击嫌疑人的车辆，蔡玉玲使用公共数据库查找了车牌，并追踪到香港边远村庄的村代表。她于2020年被捕，并于次年因查车牌登记记录时作出虚假陈述而被判有罪。法院命令她支付6000港元的罚款，约合775美元。她后来对定罪提出上诉。
"On Monday, five judges from the Court of Final Appeal voted unanimously to overturn the conviction. They argued that Ms. Choy may not have knowingly made a false statement, given that many news media companies had filed similar applications for information. By convicting Ms. Choy on the basis of inferring that she had broken the law knowingly, ""substantial and grave injustice was done to her,"" the court said in the ruling.","周一，终审法院五名法官一致投票推翻原判。他们认为，鉴于许多新闻媒体公司已经提交了类似的信息申请，蔡玉玲可能并非故意做出虚假陈述。法院在裁决中表示，在推定蔡玉玲对违法行为明知故犯的基础上对她定罪，""对上诉人造成实质及严重的不公""。"
"In remarks to reporters outside court, Ms. Choy said that she was happy with the conclusion of a legal fight that had lasted 30 months.",蔡玉玲在法庭外对记者说，她对持续了30个月的法律斗争的结果感到高兴。
"""It seems I haven't felt happy about something in a long time,"" she said. ""Maybe a lot of people feel the same way. So let us all enjoy this moment of happiness.""","""好像很久没有遇到开心的事了，""她说。""也许很多人都有同感。让我们一起享受这个开心的时刻吧。"""
"Francis Lee, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the ruling was a hard-fought victory for Ms. Choy and was a validation of the rights of journalists.",香港中文大学新闻与传播学院教授李立峯说，这项裁决对蔡玉玲来说是一场艰苦的胜利，也是对记者权利的确认。
"""One might also say that journalists should not be charged for using the car plate registry for reporting purposes in the first place, and the victory came only because of the courage and persistence of Choy,"" he said.","他说:""有人可能会说，记者为进行报道而查车牌，本不应被起诉，而胜诉完全是因为蔡玉玲的勇气和坚持。"""
"The Hong Kong Journalists Association said Ms. Choy's efforts had helped ""defend the space the industry ought to have in searching public records. We deeply respect Ms. Choy's bravery in protecting press freedom through her actions.""","香港记者协会表示，蔡玉玲的努力帮助""捍卫了该行业在搜索公共记录方面应有的空间。我们对蔡玉玲以行动捍卫新闻自由的勇气深表敬意""。"
"Ms. Choy's conviction in 2021 had created a chilling effect on news outlets, Ronson Chan, the chairman of the journalists' group, said in an interview. But even with that conviction overturned, Mr. Chan noted, the city's journalists face severe constraints under a national security law Beijing imposed in 2020. That law makes it illegal to incite hatred toward the government, a vaguely defined offense that journalists risk running afoul of if their reports are critical of the authorities.",记者协会主席陈朗昇在接受采访时表示，蔡玉玲在2021年被定罪对新闻媒体产生了寒蝉效应。但陈朗昇指出，即使这一定罪被推翻，根据北京于2020年实施的国家安全法，该市的记者也面临着严格的限制。该法规定煽动对政府的仇恨是非法的，这是一种定义模糊的罪行，如果记者在报道中批评当局，有可能触犯这一罪行。
"The broader conditions for independent journalism remain challenging in Hong Kong, with laws criminalizing ""seditious publications."" Some of the city's most outspoken independent outlets haveshutteredfollowing raids. Editors and writers are facing long trials over their work.","在香港，独立新闻业的大环境仍然充满挑战，法律将""煽动性出版物""定为刑事犯罪。该市一些最直言不讳的独立媒体在遭到突击搜查后关闭。编辑和作者因他们的工作面临漫长的审判。"
"Ms. Choy co-founded an independent media outlet called The Collective HK in February, pledging to ""monitor the rich and powerful."" She was a recipient of the Nieman fellowship at Harvard University in 2022.","蔡玉玲于2月与他人共同创立了一家名为集志社(The Collective HK)的独立媒体机构，承诺""监督富人和权贵""。她是2022年哈佛大学尼曼奖学金的获得者。"
"""In recent years, we will find that a lot of things have disappeared without a word, but I believe that inner conviction is very hard to take away,"" she said on Monday.","""近几年，很多东西无声无息地消失了，但我相信内心的信念是很难被人拿走的，""她周一表示。"
"A new version of the ABC's in Russia's Far East starts with ""A is for Army, B is for Brotherhood"" and injects a snappy phrase with every letter, like, ""Love your Army.""","在俄罗斯远东地区，新版ABC字母歌是这样开头的:""A是军队(army)，B是兄弟情(brotherhood)。""并在每个字母之间插入一个响亮的口号，例如""爱你的军队""。"
"A swim meet in the southern city of Magnitogorsk featured adolescents diving into the pool wearing camouflage uniforms,whileother competitors slung model Kalashnikov rifles across their backs.",在南部城市马格尼托哥尔斯克举行的游泳比赛中，青少年身着迷彩服潜入泳池，而其他参赛者则背着卡拉什尼科夫冲锋枪。
"""Snipers"" was the theme adopted for math classes at an elementary school in central Russia, with paper stars enumerating would-be bullet holes on a target drawn on the chalkboard.","在俄罗斯中部一所小学，数学课的主题是""狙击手""，黑板上绘制了靶子，用纸星星代表弹孔的数量。"
"As the war in Ukraine rolls into its 16th month, educational programs across Russia are awash in lessons and extracurricular activities built around military themes and patriotism.",随着乌克兰战争进入第16个月，俄罗斯各地的教育项目充斥着围绕军事主题和爱国主义的课程和课外活动。
"These efforts are part of an expansive Kremlin campaign to militarize Russian society, to train future generations to revere the army and to further entrench President Vladimir V. Putin's narrative that""a real war has once again been unleashed on our motherland,"" as he declared in a sober address at a ceremony last month.","这些做法是克里姆林宫扩大俄罗斯社会军事化运动的一部分，目的是培养后代敬畏军队，并进一步巩固总统普京的说法——他上个月在一个仪式上郑重地宣称""一场真正的战争再次在我们的祖国发动""。"
"The drumbeat of indoctrination essentially started with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, but the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has accelerated it. The Ministry of Education and Science releases a constant stream of material, including step-by-step lesson plans and real-life examples like a video of a student concert that used poetry, dance and theater to explain the history of Russian foreign intelligence.",教育灌输的号角基本上始于俄罗斯2014年吞并克里米亚，但对乌克兰的全面入侵加速了进程。教育和科学部源源不断地发布材料，包括按部就班的课程计划和真实示例——比如一段学生音乐会的视频，用诗歌、舞蹈和戏剧来解释俄罗斯对外情报工作的历史。
"""It includes all levels, from kindergarten to university,"" said Daniil Ken, the head of the Alliance of Teachers, an independent Russian union, who works from voluntary exile. ""They are trying to involve all these children, all students, directly in supporting the war.""","""它包括从幼儿园到大学的所有年级，""正在自愿流亡中的独立俄罗斯工会""教师联盟""的负责人丹尼尔·肯说。""他们试图让所有这些孩子、所有学生直接参与对这场战争的支持。"""
"For years, Russia's leaders sought to condition its citizens to accept Moscow's leadership, partly by barring politics from schools.Nowthe Kremlin hopes to persuade the public to actively back the war effort, and when it comes to younger males, to fight.",多年来，俄罗斯领导人一直试图让其公民接受莫斯科的领导，其方法包括禁止学校涉及政治。现在，克里姆林宫希望说服公众积极支持战争努力，对于年轻男性来说则应该去参战。
"Yet it alsowants to avoid fanning too high a patrioticflame, lest it push Russians to start questioning the purpose of the war. Much the way Mr. Putin has refrained from enacting multiple conscriptions of soldiers to avert prompting antiwar sentiment, the Kremlin has left parents some leeway to avoid propaganda lessons.",然而，它也希望避免煽动过于猛烈的爱国火焰，以免促使俄罗斯人开始质疑战争的目的。就像普京克制征兵次数以避免激起反战情绪一样，克里姆林宫也给父母留下了一些回旋余地，让他们可以不用上宣传课。
"In that, they may be hoping to avoid the disconnect that emerged in the Soviet era, when the education system portrayed the country as the land of Communist plenty, even as ordinary Russians could see that the shelves were bare.",在这方面，他们可能希望避免苏联时代出现的脱节，当时教育系统将这个国家描绘成共产主义的富足之地，但即便普通俄罗斯人也可以看到货架上空空如也。
"""They want enthusiasm, but they realize if they push too hard it could galvanize an organized opposition,"" said Alexandra Arkhipova, a social anthropologist who studies public reactions to the war. ""They do not want people to protest.""","""他们想要热情，但他们意识到，如果他们太过用力，可能会激起有组织的反对，""研究公众对战争反应的社会人类学家亚历山德拉·阿尔希波娃说。""他们不希望人们抗议。"""
"Interviews over the past month with sociologists, educators, parents and students, and a review of extensive material online posted by the schools themselves and by local news outlets, show a comprehensive government effort to bolster military-patriotic content through all 40,000 public schools in Russia.",过去一个月对社会学家、教育工作者、家长和学生的采访，以及对学校和当地新闻媒体在网上发布的大量材料的审查，显示了政府在全面努力对俄罗斯所有4万所公立学校加强军事爱国内容。
"The cornerstone of the initiative is a program called ""Important Conversations,"" started last September. Every Monday at 8 a.m., schools are supposed to hold an assembly to raise the Russian flag while the national anthem is played, and then convene an hourlong classroom session on topics like important milestones in Russian history.","这一行动的基石是去年9月启动的名为""重要谈话""的计划。每周一早上8点，学校应举行集会，在奏响国歌的同时升起俄罗斯国旗，然后就俄罗斯历史上的重要里程碑等话题召开一小时的课堂讨论。"
"The minister of education, Sergei Kravtsov, did not respond to written questions. When the program was introduced last fall, he told the official Tass news outlet, ""We want the current generation of schoolchildren to grow up in completely different traditions, proud of their homeland."" Both an official Telegram channel and a website disseminate materials for the classroom.","教育部长谢尔盖·克拉夫佐夫没有回答书面问题。去年秋天该计划推出时，他告诉官方媒体塔斯社，""我们希望当代学童在完全不同的传统中成长，为自己的祖国感到自豪。""官方Telegram频道和网站都为课堂传播材料。"
"""Important Conversations"" has been supplemented by programs with names like ""Lessons in Courage"" or ""Heroes Among Us."" Students have been encouraged to write poetry extolling the Motherland and the feats of Russian soldiers. Myriad videos show elementary school children reciting lines like, ""All the crooks are fleeing Russia; they have a place to live in the West; gangsters, sodomites.""","""勇气教育""或""我们中间的英雄""等课程为""重要谈话""提供补充。这些课程鼓励学生们写诗赞美祖国和俄罗斯士兵的战绩。无数视频显示小学生背诵诸如""所有骗子都逃离俄罗斯;他们都应该住到西方去;他们是歹徒，鸡奸犯。"""
"Lessons draw heavily on earlier conflicts, particularly the Soviet Union's success defeating Nazi Germany. Suggestions based onthat earlier time sometimes seem antiquated, like encouraging students to knit socks for the troops.",课程非常依赖从过去的一些战争中取材，特别是苏联成功击败纳粹德国。基于那个时代的建议有时看起来非常过时，比如鼓励学生为部队织袜子。
"Veterans are trotted into classrooms frequently to detail their experiences. In late April in Dmitrov, a small city near Moscow, three soldiers addressed a roomful of students aged 10 to 15, some waving small Russian flags. A video of the session shows one fighter talking about wanting to protect his homeland against ""fascist filth.""","课堂上频频出现退伍军人，他们在课上详细介绍自己的经历。4月下旬，在莫斯科附近的一个小城市德米特罗夫，三名士兵向一屋子10至15岁的学生讲话，其中一些学生挥舞着小小的俄罗斯国旗。该会议的一段视频显示一名士兵谈论想要保护他的祖国免受""法西斯污秽""的侵害。"
"Overall, however, there is no monolithic propaganda machine because the decision on how to implement ""Important Conversations"" has largely been left to local school administrators.","然而，总的来说没有使用单一的宣传机器，因为""重要谈话""的具体操作在很大程度上交给了当地学校领导来决定。"
"Some teachers take a hard ideological approach. A video posted by the Doxa news outlet showed a teacher demanding that students pump their fists in the air while singing a popular song called, ""I Am Russian."" The teacher barks: ""The thrust should be to the sky, to NATO.""","一些教师采取强硬的意识形态方法。Doxa新闻媒体发布的一段视频显示，一位老师要求学生在唱一首名为《我是俄罗斯人》的流行歌曲时挥舞拳头。老师咆哮道:""力量应该指向天空，指向北约。"""
"Other teachers do not even mention the war, particularly in places like Moscow, where many parents disapprove of attempts to indoctrinate their children.",而有的老师甚至不提战争，尤其是在莫斯科这样的地方，那里的许多父母不赞成对孩子灌输思想的做法。
"Yuri Lapshin, formerly the student psychologist at an elite Moscow high school, said in an interview that while researching a paper, he found examples of unique interpretations of the program. Onemath teacher, for example, told students that the most important conversation in the world was about algebra, so he dedicated the class to that. On a day supposedly focused on the concept of ""fatherland,"" a biology teacher lectured about salmon spawning in the rivers where they hatched.","莫斯科一所精英高中的前学生心理学家尤里·拉普辛在接受采访时说，在研究一篇论文时，他发现了一些对该项目的独特诠释。例如，一位数学老师告诉学生，世界上最重要的对话是关于代数的，所以他的那堂课专门讲代数。在一个以""祖国""(fatherland)概念为中心的主题日，一位生物老师讲授了鲑鱼在当初它们孵化的河流中产卵的现象。"
"Even when the war lessons occur, theysometimes fall flat. At an assembly with two fighters, students from a St. Petersburg technical college basically mocked them. They questioned why fighting in another country meant they were defending Russia, and how God might view murdering others, according to a recording of the assembly. Administrators rebuked at least five students for their questions, local reports said.",即使有战争课堂，有时也会难以展开。在圣彼得堡的一所理工学院，有一次校会请来两名士兵，学生基本上是在嘲笑他们。根据校会的录音，学生们质疑为什么在另一个国家打仗意味着他们在保卫俄罗斯，以及上帝会如何看待谋杀他人。当地报道称，校领导因这些问题斥责了至少五名学生。
"Sasha Boychenko, 17, a high school senior, attended four ""Important Conversations"" sessions in Vladivostok last fall before her family left Russia. Bored students laughed at the historic displays, she recalled. ""After the class, we wondered why we had come,"" she said in an interview.","去年秋天，17岁的高三学生萨莎·博伊琴科在符拉迪沃斯托克参加了四次""重要谈话""课程，后来她和家人离开了俄罗斯。她回忆说，百无聊赖的学生们嘲笑这些历史展览。她在接受采访时说:""下课后，我们都在想，我们到底为什么要来。"""
"Alexander Kondrashev, a history teacher in Russia for 10 years, said he was awaiting a revised version of the textbooks this fall.

"""Nobody perceives 'Important Conversations' as learning something that will come in handy in life, like physics, math, geography or the knowledge from history lessons,"" Mr. Kondrashev said in an interview.","""没有人认为'重要谈话'是在学习生活中会派上用场的东西，就像那些物理、数学、地理或历史课上的知识，""康德拉舍夫在接受采访时说。"
"Noncompliance takes various forms. The Alliance of Teachers advised parents that they can formally opt out of the classes, while some have their children show up late or call in sick on Mondays. Defiance makes certain parents nervous, experts said, especially given about a dozen cases where school officials reported on unenthusiastic parents or students.",不服从的形式是多种多样的。教师联盟建议家长们，他们可以正式选择不参加这些课程，而有些家长让自己的孩子在周一迟到或请病假。专家说，反抗让某些家长感到紧张，尤其是考虑到学校官员报告了十几起家长或学生不热情的案例。
"A woman namedZarema, 47, said she worried about her three sons in school in Dagestan. While shesends her youngestson, a sixth grader, to the ""Important Conversations"" class, she told him never to engage politically. ""We are all scared of everything here now,"" she said, asking that her full name not be used while criticizing the war.","47岁的扎雷马说，她担心自己在达吉斯坦上学的三个儿子。她送六年级的小儿子去上""重要谈话""课程时，告诉他永远不要参与政治。""我们现在对这里的一切都感到害怕，""她说。因为涉及批评这场战争，她要求不要使用自己的全名。"
"Russia has largely presented the war as an economic opportunity in poorer areas, while being far less aggressive in major cities.",俄罗斯在很大程度上把这场战争说成贫困地区的经济机会，而在大城市的手段则相对含蓄。
"""They are trying to target the people who have fewer resources,"" Greg Yudin, a Russian sociologist doing research at Princeton University, said in an interview. ""They give you an option that promises money, status, benefits and in addition to that you will be a hero."" Even if they persuade only 20 percent of the youth to join the army, that is still a lot of brigades, he noted.","""他们试图针对的是那些资源较少的人，""在普林斯顿大学做研究的俄罗斯社会学家格雷格·尤丁在接受采访时说。""他们给你一个选择，承诺金钱、地位、福利，除此之外，你还会成为英雄。""他指出，即使他们只说服了20%的年轻人参军，那仍然是一支很庞大的部队。"
"Toward that end, the Ministries of Education and Defense have announced that military training will be mandatory next year for 10th-grade students. Girls will learn battlefield first aid, while the boys will be instructed in drill formation and handling a Kalashnikov, among other skills.",为此，教育部和国防部宣布，明年将让十年级学生接受强制性军事训练。女孩将学习战场急救，而男孩将学习操练队形和使用卡拉什尼科夫冲锋枪等技能。
"At universities, the curriculum in the fall will include a mandatory course called ""The Fundamentals of Russian Statehood.""","在大学，秋季的课程将包括一门名为""俄罗斯国家基础""的必修课。"
"The course is still in development, Mr. Yudin noted, but he said thatwhat details have emerged tended to echo Mr. Putin's worldview of Russian exceptionalism and the idea that the battle waged against Western dominance for the past 1,000 years would continue for another 1,000.",尤丁指出，课程仍在制定中，但他说，已经出现的细节往往与普京的俄罗斯例外主义世界观相呼应，并称过去千年来针对西方统治的战斗还将持续千年。
"""The single best possible way for them to get this society mobilized is to brainwash the young,"" Mr. Yudin said.","""对他们来说，动员整个社会的最佳方式就是给年轻人洗脑，""尤丁说。"
"Walking through Nagu, a small town in the mountains of southwestern China, the signs of a vibrant Muslim community are ubiquitous. Loudspeakers broadcast passages from a Chinese translation of the Quran. Women in head scarves shuttle rowdy children home from school. Arabic script decorates the outside of homes.",走在中国西南部山区的纳古镇，一个生机勃勃的穆斯林社区的迹象随处可见。扩音器里播放着中译古兰经的段落。戴着头巾的女子把闹哄哄的孩子们从学校接回家。房屋外面涂着阿拉伯文的装饰。
"Towering over it all is the Najiaying Mosque, a white building topped with an emerald dome and four minarets that reach 230 feet into the air. For decades, the mosque has been the pride of the Muslim Hui ethnic minority that lives here.",纳家营清真寺高耸在这一切之上。这座高达70米的白色建筑有一个翡翠色的穹顶和四个宣礼塔。几十年来，这座清真寺一直是居住在这里的回族(信奉穆斯林的少数民族)人的骄傲。
"Last month, it was also the scene of a confrontation.",上个月，这里也成了冲突的现场。
"On the morning of May 27, after the authorities drove construction cranes into the mosque's courtyard, a crowd of residents confronted the hundreds of police officers in riot gear who had been deployed to oversee the work. As the officers blocked the mosque and used pepper spray, residents threw water bottles and bricks.",5月27日清晨，在当局将两辆起重机开进清真寺的院子时，一群居民与数百名被派来监视拆除工程、配有防暴装备的警察发生了冲突。警察封锁了清真寺，并向抗议者喷辣椒水，居民们向警察投掷水瓶和砖头。
"The rare clashes, described in interviews with eyewitnesses and captured on videos posted on social media, show how one aspect of the Chinese Communist Party's campaign to exert greater control over religion could grow more volatile.",通过目击者在接受采访时的描述和社交媒体上发布的视频，可以了解到这些罕见的冲突，它们表明在中国共产党加强宗教控制行动中，有时可能会出现较为动荡的局面。
"Since China's leader, Xi Jinping, rose to power more than a decade ago, the party has torn down Christian churches, razed Tibetan Buddhist enclaves and put Uyghur Muslims in internment camps in the name of political security. But it has also gone after lesser-known groups, including theHui, who make up less than 1 percent of the population and have historically assimilated well with the ethnic Han majority.",自从中国领导人习近平在十多年前上台以来，中共以政治安全的名义拆毁了基督教教堂，夷平了藏传佛教徒的居住地，并将维吾尔穆斯林关入拘禁营。但它还打击了一些受关注较少的群体，包括回族。回族占人口的比例不到1%，历史上与占人口多数的汉族同化良好。
"The party has systematically closed, demolished or forcibly redesigned mosques in Hui enclaves across the country, condemning Arabic architectural features, such as domes and minarets, as proof of unwanted foreign influence over Islam in China. Resistance has been limited, and the mosque in Nagu, along with another large one in the nearby town of Shadian,isamong the last major ones with such architecture still standing in China.",中共有计划地关闭、拆除或强行重新设计全国各地回族聚居区的清真寺，将穹顶和宣礼塔等阿拉伯建筑特征斥为外国对中国伊斯兰教产生有害影响的证据。抵抗是有限的，纳古的清真寺，以及附近沙甸镇的另一座大型清真寺是中国仅存的几座大型清真寺之一。
"But when local officials announced plans to remove bothmosques'domes and remake theirminarets in a purportedly more ""Chinese"" style, people in Nagufought back.","但当地官员宣布计划拆除两座清真寺的穹顶，并以据称更""中国""的风格重建宣礼塔时，纳古人做出了反抗。"
"""This roof represents our respect and freedom. We chose it freely ourselves at the time,"" said Mr. Na, a Hui resident in his 30s, who asked to be identified only by his last name for fear of government retaliation. His family, like many in town, had helped fund the mosque's most recent renovations in the early 2000s, when the minarets were added. ""Now they are saying, 'My rule overrides your free choice.'""","""我们把这个顶，当作我们的尊严、自由，当时是我们自由选择的，""30多岁的回民纳先生说，因为担心政府报复，他要求记者只给出他的姓。他家人和镇上的许多人一样，曾在本世纪初帮助该清真寺最近的一次翻修筹集资金，宣礼塔就是那次添加的。""现在它就是说，我的统治意义是凌驾于你的自由选择之上。"""
"The mosques in Nagu and Shadian hold particular importance in the story of Beijing's relationship with Islam, which has fluctuated between conflict and coexistence. Yunnan Province, where both Nagu and Shadian are, is China's most ethnically diverse, and the Hui people most of whom speak Mandarin but are distinguished by their Muslim faith have lived there for centuries. The earliest version of Nagu'smosque was built in the 14th century, in a traditional Chinese courtyard style. Yunnan's Muslims prospered as merchants trading with Southeast Asia.",纳古和沙甸的清真寺在中国政府与伊斯兰教时而冲突、时而共存的关系史上尤为重要。 纳古和沙甸所在的云南省是中国少数民族最多的省份，而大多数人都说普通话、以穆斯林信仰著称的回族已在云南各地生活了几个世纪。纳古的清真寺始建于14世纪，带有传统的中国庭院风格。云南的穆斯林因为与东南亚的贸易而繁荣起来。
"Then, after the Communist takeover, officials began to attack religion as counterrevolutionary, especially during the 1966-1976 period of political upheaval known as the Cultural Revolution. Muslims in Shadian resisted, and in 1975 the military razed the town and massacred as many as 1,600 residents.","后来，掌权后的中共官员将宗教视为一股反革命势力，开始对其进行打击，尤其是在被称为""文化大革命""的(1966年至1976年)十年政治动荡时期。沙甸的穆斯林曾与政府发生对抗，1975年，军队在当地进行镇压，将镇子夷为平地，造成多达1600名平民死亡。"
"After the Cultural Revolution, as China opened to the world, the government apologizedfor the massacre. It supported the reconstruction of Shadian and permitted locals many of whom could travel abroad for the first time to build the Grand Mosque, the largest in southwestern China, in its present Arabic style. Modeled after the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia, the building can hold 10,000 people, and its minarets are visible from miles away. Officials promoted it as a tourist site.","""文革""后，随着中国向世界开放，政府曾为那场大屠杀道歉，支持沙甸的重建，并允许当地人——其中许多人是第一次获许出国旅行——修建了现在这座阿拉伯风格的大清真寺，它是中国西南地区最大的一座清真寺。沙甸大清真寺以沙特阿拉伯麦地那的先知清真寺为蓝本，可容纳一万人，其宣礼塔在数公里外就可看到。官方曾将其作为旅游景点来宣传。"
"The Nagu mosque, 90 miles from Shadian, also grew and evolved, becoming a regional training center for imams. When locals, starting in the 1980s, added a dome and other Arabic features, the government did not interfere. In 2018, the local government designated it a cultural relic.",距沙甸约140公里的纳家营清真寺也在这期间变得更大、建筑风格发生了变化，成了一个阿訇宗教培训中心。当地人从20世纪80年代起给清真寺加盖穹顶、增添其他阿拉伯特征时，政府并没有干预。2018年，地方政府将其定为文物。
"""These mosques symbolize that the Chinese government accepted that they were wrong during the Cultural Revolution,"" said Ruslan Yusupov, a scholar of China and Islam at Harvard University. The Shadian mosque in particular, he said, serves as a reminder ""both about violence but also about state-sponsored recovery.""","""这些清真寺是中国政府承认他们在文化大革命期间犯了错误的象征，""在哈佛大学研究中国和伊斯兰教的学者鲁斯兰·尤苏波夫说。尤其是沙甸的清真寺，他说，它""既是关于暴力，也是关于国家支持的复苏""的提醒。"
"But in recent years, restrictions on Islam began accumulating again, especially after a 2014 attackon civilians at a train station in Kunming, Yunnan's capital, that left 31 people dead. The Chinese government said the attackers were Uyghur separatists who had spent time in Shadian.",但近年来，政府对伊斯兰教的限制开始变得越来越多，尤其是在2014年的袭击事件之后，那次发生在云南省省会昆明火车站的袭击平民事件导致了31人死亡。中国政府称，袭击者是曾住在沙甸的维吾尔分裂分子。
"Officials stopped promoting Shadian. In Nagu, female teachers were barred from wearing head scarves at school, residents said. A volunteer group there no longer offers free tutoring in the mosque, after officials stepped up controls on education.",官员们不再宣传沙甸。居民说，在纳古，当局禁止女教师在学校戴头巾。官员加强了对教育的控制之后，那里的一个志愿小组不再在清真寺提供免费辅导。
"In 2021, the so-called Sinicization campaign to remove Arabic features arrived in Nagu. Government officials began visiting homes, sometimes on a daily basis, to coax residents to support changes to the mosque. A town billboard shows a rendering of the government's plan: the dome gone, the minarets decorated with pagoda-like tiers. Officials have also recently gone door-to-door in Shadian.",2021年，一场所谓的中国化运动降临纳古，这场运动的目的是消除阿拉伯特征。为了劝说当地居民支持对清真寺进行改造，政府官员开始登门拜访，有时甚至天天来。镇上一个广告牌展示着政府改造方案的效果图:穹顶没有了，宣礼塔变成了类似佛塔的建筑。官员们最近也开始在沙甸挨家挨户地走访。
"""Because of the sheer authority these places occupy in the imagination"" of local Muslims, ""they had to leave these two mosques to the very end,"" Mr. Yusupov said.","""由于这些地方(在当地穆斯林的)想象中占据绝对权威地位，他们不得不把这两座清真寺留到最后处理，""尤苏波夫说。"
"To Hui residents in Nagu, which The New York Times visited shortly after the protest, the remodeling plan was a precursor to a more sweeping repression of their way of life.",对当地回族居民来说，清真寺改造预示着政府将更全面地压制他们的生活方式。
"A woman in her 30s, also surnamed Na a common surname in Nagu said she had grown up playing and studying in the mosque. Neighbors and relatives had attended university elsewhere in China, but returned to Nagu for its small-town, pious atmosphere, where they could pass Muslim values onto their children.","一名也姓纳(""纳""是纳古的大姓)的30多岁女性说，她小时后经常在清真寺里玩耍和学习。曾到中国其他地方读大学的邻居和亲戚们毕业后回到纳古，因为他们喜欢这个小镇的虔诚氛围，可以在这里将穆斯林价值观传授给他们的孩子。"
"Ms. Na said she would be willing to accept the removal of the dome in isolation: ""Our faith is in our hearts, that's just a building."" But she worried, especially after seeing the authorities' forceful tactics, that it would not stop there.","纳女士说，如果拆除穹顶是件孤立的事情，她倒是能接受:""我们的信仰在心中，那只是一座建筑。""但她担心政府不会就此而止，尤其是在看到当局采取了强硬手段之后。"
"""The first step is exterior renovations,"" she said. ""The second step will be telling you to erase the Arabic script that we have on every home.""","""第一步是风貌改造，""她说。 ""第二步，他就让我们每家每户建筑上都有的阿拉伯文，门口也有，屋顶也有，和清真寺一样的，汉族说洋葱顶，他下一步要你自己把它们全部抹掉，不让写。"""
"The authorities are not backing down. Several hours after the clash began, the police retreated from the mosque, before the midday prayers. But the next day, the local authorities issued a notice denouncing the ""serious disruption of social order"" and promising a ""severe crackdown."" In the days afterward, local officials repeatedly blared that notice over loudspeakers, including late at night.","面对反对，当局没有让步。在冲突开始几小时后，警察曾一度在正午祈祷前撤出了清真寺。但地方当局第二天发布通告谴责这场""严重妨害社会管理秩序的案件""，并承诺要""严厉打击""。那之后的几天里，当地官员已多次(包括深夜)在扩音器里大声广播这份通告。"
"On China's heavily censored social media platforms, Islamophobic comments swelled, including from government-affiliated commentators.",在中国受到严格审查的社交媒体平台上，仇视伊斯兰教的评论激增，包括来自政府下属的评论员。
"In Nagu, residents were entering and exiting the mosque, but security remained tight, with a drone flying overhead. Plainclothes police officers approached a reporter from The Times and had her driven out of the town.",纳古的居民们仍在清真寺出入，但安保措施严密，一架无人机从头顶飞过。便衣警察来到时报记者身边，用车将她送出了镇子。
"The authorities in Shadian were also on high alert, with officials intercepting the reporter at the train station. Still, they agreed to take her to the Grand Mosque.",沙甸当局也处于高度戒备状态，官员在火车站阻拦了时报记者，但同意将她带到大清真寺。
"""Of course, the Quran came from Saudi Arabia, but after arriving in China, it must adapt,"" said Li Heng, an official from the local bureau of ethnic and religious affairs, as he stood in the plaza before the mosque.","""我们比如古兰经，他肯定在我们沙特这边传过来的，但是到我们中国后，它要做具体适应我们社会主义社会现在发展的解释。""当地的民族宗教事务局官员李恒(音)站在清真寺前的广场上说。"
"""When our imams give sermons,"" he said, ""they must integrate the core socialist values the government is promoting.""","""政府要求提倡的这些社会主义核心价值观这些正能量的东西要和古兰经进行相融合，""他说。"
"Mr. Li insisted that officials were not interfering with religious freedom, and that the plan would proceed only with locals' assent.",李恒坚称，官员不是在干涉宗教自由，改造方案只是在当地人同意的情况下才会进行。
"He added: ""Patriotism is the highest form of religious belief.""","他还说:""爱国才是爱教最高的信仰。"""
"Back in Nagu, the cranes still sat in the mosque courtyard several days after the clash. The demolition was likely inevitable, said Mr. Na, the Hui resident. But he hoped residents would be allowed to hold on to other freedoms that they were not willing to compromise. For him, that included the right to pass his religion onto his children.",回到纳古，起重机在冲突发生数日后仍停在清真寺的院子里。前面提到的回族居民纳先生说，拆除似乎已不可避免。但他希望能允许居民们保留一些他们不愿妥协的其他自由。就他本人而言，包括将自己的宗教信仰传授给孩子的权利。
"""If you can't guard your bottom line, then others will see you as someone without a bottom line,"" he said, ""and they'll trample over it again and again.""","""如果你没有能力守护你的底线的时候，那么对别人来讲你是没有底线的人，""他说，""他可以一次又一次的践踏你的底线。"""
"When Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France recently made separate but friendly visits to China, it sparked considerable dismay among their fellow leaders in Europe and Washington.",不久前，德国总理朔尔茨和法国总统马克龙分别对中国进行了友好访问，这在欧洲和华盛顿的领导人当中引发了相当大的不安。
"Especially given Beijing's ""no-limits partnership"" with Russia, the efforts to treat China as what Mr. Macron called ""a strategic and global partner,"" rather than as a rival, were met with sometimes caustic criticism.","尤其考虑到中俄""没有止境的伙伴关系""，像马克龙那样将中国称为""战略和全球伙伴""而非对手有时会遭到严厉批评。"
"Yet, an extensive opinion poll released on Wednesday, shows that Europeans tend to agree with them.",然而，周三公布的一项广泛的民意调查显示，欧洲人倾向于同意马克龙等人的观点。
"Even as Beijing moves closer to Moscow, and despite the war in Ukraine, a majority of Europeans still see China predominantly as ""a necessary partner,"" according to the poll of more than 6,000 people in 11 E.U. member states carried out in April by the European Council on Foreign Relations.","欧洲对外关系委员会在4月份对11个欧盟成员国的6000多人进行的调查显示，尽管北京正在向莫斯科靠拢，尽管乌克兰发生了战争，但大多数欧洲人仍将中国主要视为""一个必要的合作伙伴""。"
The poll indicates that majorities in all 11 countries are unwilling to support the United States against China if there were to be a military escalation between these two powers and would wish to remain neutral.,民意调查显示，如果两个大国之间的军事冲突升级，所有11个国家的大多数人都不愿意支持美国对抗中国，而是希望保持中立。
"At the same time, Russia is increasingly seen as an adversary or rival, a view held by some 64 percent of respondents, an increase from about a third of respondents when the same question was posed in a 2021 poll.",与此同时，俄罗斯越来越被视为敌手或对手，约64%的受访者持这一观点，而在2021年的一次民意调查中，这一比例约为三分之一。
"""Europeans clearly see the Russia-China alliance and that it's formed against the West, but they treat them differently,"" said Jana Puglierin, co-author of the report accompanying the poll. ""That only changes if China supplies arms to Russia.""","""欧洲人显然看到了俄中联盟，认为它是针对西方的，但他们对中俄的态度不同，""调查报告的合著者亚娜·普格利林说。""只有中国向俄罗斯提供武器，情况才会改变。"""
"Indeed, 41 percent of Europeans would support economic sanctions against China if Beijing were to provide significant military aid to Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, while 33 percent would oppose that step.",事实上，如果北京向入侵乌克兰的俄罗斯提供大量军事援助，41%的欧洲人支持对中国实施经济制裁，33%的人反对这一举措。
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points in larger countries and plus or minus three percentage points in smaller ones.,该调查在较大国家的误差幅度为正负两个百分点，在较小国家的误差幅度为正负三个百分点。
"While wishing to cooperate with Beijing on global issues like climate change, European leaders officially consider China a ""systemic rival"" and ""economic competitor,"" according to their ""strategic compass,"" the European Union's strategy paper.","虽然希望在气候变化等全球问题上与北京合作，但根据欧盟的战略文件""战略指南针""，欧洲领导人正式将中国视为""系统性对手""和""经济竞争对手""。"
"Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in a speech in late March, took a tough line on Beijing, saying that it was entering a new era of ""security and control,"" had a policy of ""divide and conquer"" and that Europe must ""de-risk"" key sectors from dependence on China.","欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩在3月底的一次演讲中对北京采取了强硬立场，称中国正在进入一个""安全和控制""的新时代，其政策是""分治法""， 欧洲必须为关键部门""去风险""，使其不再依赖中国。"
"Her views are closer to those of the Biden administration, but European opinion is closer to the views of Mr. Macron, Ms. Puglierin said.",普格列林说，冯德莱恩的观点更接近拜登政府的观点，但欧洲的舆论更接近马克龙的观点。
"Yet Mr. Macron was widely criticized for his comments after visiting China's president Xi Jinping in April, when he said that Europe should not be ""followers"" on Taiwan or ""adapt ourselves to an American rhythm and a Chinese overreaction.""","然而，马克龙在4月访华后的言论受到了广泛批评，他说欧洲不应该在台湾问题上做""追随者""，或者""让我们自己适应美国的节奏和中国的过度反应""。"
"He said that it would be ""a trap for Europe"" to get caught up in crises ""that are not ours."" Europeans should continue to develop their own strategic autonomy and become a ""third pole"" in the world order, and not risk becoming ""vassals"" in a U.S.-China confrontation. Like Mr. Scholz, Mr. Macron downplayed any rivalry and said that China was ""a strategic and global partner.""","他说，陷入""不属于我们的""危机将落入""为欧洲设置的陷阱""。欧洲人应该继续发展自己的战略自主权，成为世界秩序的""第三极""，而不是冒险成为美中对抗的""附庸""。和朔尔茨一样，马克龙淡化了竞争，称中国是""战略和全球合作伙伴""。"
"Still, while France and Germany are the main partners for Beijing, ""the reality is that French businesses are disillusioned with the Chinese market, and the long-term picture for Sino-French economic partnership looks gloomy at best,"" cautioned Philippe Le Corre, a scholar of China with the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis.","然而，尽管法德是北京的主要合作伙伴，""现实情况是，法国企业对中国市场的幻想破灭了，中法经济伙伴关系的长期前景充其量也是黯淡的，""亚洲协会政策研究所中国分析中心的中国问题学者陆克(Philippe Le Corre)警告。"
"For him, the most important finding of the survey is that French and German respondents have fairly negative views of China, with only 31 percent of the French and 33 percent of Germans seeing China as a ""partner,"" while 50 percent of Germans and 41 percent of the French see China as a rival or an adversary.","在他看来，这个调查最重要的发现是法德受访者对中国的看法相当负面，只有31%的法国人和33%的德国人将中国视为""伙伴""，而50%的德国人和41%的法国人将中国视为对手或敌手。"
"That would seem to leave both leaders, even if more in tune with European sentiments, on more challenging ground at home, but perhaps making it easier for Germany in particular to reduce its significant economy dependency on trade with China, especially in the key automotive sector.",这似乎会让两位领导人在国内面临更大的挑战——尽管他们与欧洲的情绪更加一致，但可能会使得德国更容易减少对中国贸易的严重依赖，尤其是在关键的汽车行业。
"Elsewhere, Mr. Le Corre said, Europeans were either ""largely apathetic"" about China or wary, especially of Chinese investment in European infrastructure, tech companies and the media. ""Europeans do not want an increase in Chinese foreign direct investments so much for the Belt and Road Initiative,"" Mr. Le Corre said, referring to China's push to build ports, rail lines and telecommunications networks around the world.","陆克说，在其他方面，欧洲人要么对中国""基本上漠不关心""，要么持谨慎态度，尤其是对中国对欧洲基础设施、科技公司和媒体的投资。""欧洲人不希望中国增加对外直接投资—— '一带一路'没什么戏了，""陆克说道。""一带一路""指的是中国推动在世界各地建设港口、铁路和电信网络的计划。"
"Views on Russia have hardened, with majorities seeing Russia as an adversary, with growing doubts about Moscow even in traditionally sympathetic France and Italy, pointed out Pawel Zerka, a co-author of the report.",该报告的合著者帕维尔·泽尔卡指出，对俄罗斯的看法已经变得强硬，大多数人将俄罗斯视为对手，即使在传统上同情俄罗斯的法国和意大利，对莫斯科的怀疑也越来越大。
"Roughly half of all respondents believe that even after a peace in Ukraine, future relations with Russia should be ""limited."" But in Bulgaria and Hungary a majority of respondents viewed Russia as an ""ally"" or ""partner"" and in general would like to cooperate with Moscow after the war.","大约一半的受访者认为，即使乌克兰实现和平，未来与俄罗斯的关系也应该是""有限的""。但在保加利亚和匈牙利，大多数受访者将俄罗斯视为""盟友""或""伙伴""，总体上愿意在战后与莫斯科合作。"
"While views of the United States as an ally have improved from 2021, when Donald J. Trump was president, roughly three-quarters of respondents believe that Europe should reduce its security dependence on Washington and invest more in its own defense. Some 56 percent of all respondents said that the re-election of Mr. Trump would weaken trans-Atlantic relations.",虽然比起2021年特朗普担任总统时，把美国视作盟友的看法有所改善，但大约四分之三的受访者认为，欧洲应该减少对华盛顿的安全依赖，加大对自身防务的投资。约56%的受访者表示，特朗普连任会削弱跨大西洋关系。
"In general, Ms. Puglierin said, ""Europeans are ready to praise the trans-Atlantic relationship and see more benefits than risks, but don't see that it comes with obligations. They don't see that Taiwan is considered a fundamental part of U.S. strategy or that it is linked with Ukraine,"" or to the protection of the Pacific sea lanes on which European trade depends.","普格列林说，总的来说，""欧洲人乐于赞扬跨大西洋关系，他们认为利大于弊，但不认为它伴随着义务。""他们没有看到台湾被视为美国战略的一个基本组成部分，也不觉得台湾与乌克兰存在关联""，此外，他们也不认为台湾与保护欧洲贸易所依赖的太平洋航道有关。"
"""There is little awareness that it would be problematic not to side with the U.S. after it has invested so much in Europe,"" she said. ""They see neutrality as an option.""","""几乎没有人意识到，在美国对欧洲投资了这么多之后，不站在美国一边会有问题，""她说。""他们把中立视为一种选择。"""
"A major dam on the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine was destroyed early Tuesday, sending torrents of water cascading through the breach, flooding a war zone downstream, putting tens of thousands of residents at risk and raising the possibility of long-lasting environmental and humanitarian disasters.",周二早些时候，乌克兰南部第聂伯河上的一座大坝被毁，洪水从决口处倾泻而下，淹没了下游的战区，使数万居民处于危险之中，并很可能发生长期环境和人道主义灾难。
"Ukraine and Russia quickly blamed each other for the calamity. Officials in Kyiv said Moscow's forces had blown up the Russian-controlled dam in the predawn hours, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine pointed the finger at ""Russian terrorists."" The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, denied any Russian involvement and described the destruction as ""sabotage.""","乌克兰和俄罗斯迅速将这场灾难归咎于对方。基辅的官员说，莫斯科的军队在黎明前炸毁了俄罗斯控制的大坝，乌克兰总统泽连斯基将矛头指向""俄罗斯恐怖分子""。克里姆林宫发言人德米特里·S·佩斯科夫否认俄罗斯参与，并称大坝的毁坏是""蓄意破坏""。"
"It was not immediately clear who or what had caused the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and hydroelectric power plant near the city of Nova Kakhovka. But some top European officials denounced Russia. Engineering and munitions experts said a deliberate explosion inside the dam had most likely caused its collapse. Structural failure or an attack from outside the structure, they said, were possible but less plausible.",目前尚不清楚是何人因何原因破坏了新卡霍夫卡市附近的卡霍夫卡大坝和水力发电厂。但一些欧洲高级官员谴责了俄罗斯。工程和弹药专家表示，很可能是有人在大坝内部有意制造爆炸，从而导致大坝坍塌。他们说，结构故障或来自结构外部的攻击也有可能，但可能性不大。
"The dam's destruction was a ""monumental humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe,"" and ""yet another example of the horrific price of war on people,"" said Antonio Guterres, the United Nations' secretary general.","联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯说，大坝的毁坏是一场""巨大的人道主义、经济和生态灾难""，也是""战争给人们带来可怕代价的又一例证""。"
"The dam, in the Kherson region, had held back a body of water the size of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukraine's main hydropower generating company, Ukrhydroenergo, said in an interview that it had collapsed after an explosion about 2:50 a.m. Tuesday.",位于赫尔松地区的大坝阻挡的水体规模相当于犹他州大盐湖。乌克兰主要水力发电公司乌克兰水能公司的负责人伊霍·西罗塔在接受采访时表示，大坝在周二凌晨2点50分左右发生爆炸后决堤。
"""The damage is huge, and the station can't be repaired,"" he said. ""The lower part of it has already been washed away.""","""损失巨大，水电站无法修复，""他说。""下面的部分已经被冲走了。"""
"Residents in the town of Antonivka, about 40 miles downstream, described watching in horror as floodwaters swept by carrying trees and debris from washed-out houses. The Ukrainian authorities raced to evacuate people by train and bus.",下游约65公里处的安东尼夫卡镇的居民描述说，他们惊恐地看着洪水冲走了树木和被毁坏的房屋的碎片。乌克兰当局争分夺秒地用火车和公共汽车疏散民众。
"For miles along the flood plain, others waded through water, rescuing pets and belongings, videos and images on social media showed. Some people rode bicycles down streets submerged in muddy water. In Mykolaiv, an emergency train collected those fleeing the rising waters in Kherson.",社交媒体上的视频和图片显示，沿着冲积平原数公里，人们涉水救出宠物和财物。一些人在被泥水淹没的街道上骑着自行车。在尼古拉耶夫，一列紧急列车接上逃离赫尔松上涨水域的人们。
"About 16,000 people total remained in the ""critical zone"" on the Ukrainian-controlled west bank of the river, said Oleksandr Prokudin, the regional military administrator. The National Police of Ukraine said that 23 towns and villages had been flooded so far, and that the water level in the Dnipro had risen by nearly 11 feet in the city of Kherson. By 9 p.m. local time, at least 1,366 people had been evacuated from flooded zones, the police said on the Telegram messaging app.","地区军事长官奥列克桑德尔·普罗库丁说，总共约有1.6万人还在乌克兰控制的河流西岸的""关键地带""。乌克兰国家警察称，迄今为止已有23个城镇和村庄被淹，第聂伯河的水位在赫尔松市上涨了近3.3米。到当地时间晚上9点，警方在Telegram消息应用程序上说，至少有1366人从洪水泛滥的地区撤离。"
The destruction occurred a day after American officials said they had detected what could be the beginning of Ukraine's long-anticipated counteroffensive to repel Russian forces east of the Dnipro in the Donetsk region. Russia's military said it had beat back several attacks by Kyiv's troops.,破坏发生前一天，美国官员表示，他们发现乌克兰期待已久的反攻行动已经开始，意在击退第聂伯河以东顿涅茨克地区的俄罗斯军队。俄罗斯军方表示基辅军队的几次攻击已经被他们击退。
"Sergei K. Shoigu, Russia's defense minister, accused Ukraine of destroying the dam because it wanted to move forces and equipment defending Kherson to other parts of the front to help with its counteroffensive. Ukraine said it was Russia that blew up the dam to prevent Ukrainian troops from crossing the river downstream.",俄罗斯国防部长谢尔盖·绍伊古指责乌克兰摧毁大坝，因为这样乌克兰就可以将保卫赫尔松的军队和装备转移到前线的其他地方，以助其反攻。乌克兰表示，是俄罗斯炸毁了大坝，以阻止乌克兰军队在下游渡河。
"The dam, the southernmost one on the Dnipro, was built between 1950 and 1956 as part of a broader effort to capitalize on the economic power of the river known as the ""Great Dnipro."" It was downstream from the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which relies on the Kakhovka reservoir to cool its reactors.","该大坝是第聂伯河最南端的大坝，建于1950年至1956年间，属于为充分利用这条所谓""大第聂伯河""的经济力量而实施的总体计划的一部分。它位于俄罗斯控制的扎波里日亚核电站的下游，该核电站要依靠卡霍夫卡水库冷却其反应堆。"
"Initially, there was concern that if the river level fell far enough, the plant, Europe's largest civilian nuclear facility, would be unable to draw water, potentially leading to a meltdown. But Ukraine's state nuclear company, Energoatom, said in a statement that while the destruction ""may have negative consequences"" for the Zaporizhzhia plant, it had sufficient water for now from a nearby pond for cooling.","最初，人们担心如果河流水位下降得太多，欧洲最大的民用核设施工厂将无法取水，可能导致熔毁。但乌克兰国家核能发电公司(Energoatom)在一份声明中表示，虽然破坏对扎波里日亚核电站""可能产生负面影响""，但它目前已从附近的池塘中获得了足够的水来进行冷却。"
"""The situation is under control,"" the statement said.","声明说:""情况已得到控制。"""
"Experts were still waiting to understand the full scale of the disaster. Videos verified by The New York Times and images on social media showed water flooding communities downstream. Floodwaters swamped houses, spilled over into farm fields, blocked roads and deluged a zoo in the Russia-controlled city of Nova Kakhovka, the mayor, Volodymyr Kovalenko, said. City Hall and the Palace of Culture there were also inundated.",专家们仍在努力了解灾难的整体规模。经《纽约时报》核实的视频和社交媒体上的图片显示，洪水淹没了下游社区。在俄罗斯控制的新卡霍夫卡市，市长弗拉基米尔·科瓦连科说，洪水淹没了房屋，波及农田，阻塞了道路，并淹没该市一家动物园。市政厅和文化宫也被淹没。
"A satellite image showed the dam was breached in three places. About 200 yards of its central area was destroyed, and a structure at the hydroelectric plant sitting atop the dam was split in two. A drone video initially showed part of the southern end of the dam still intact. A few hours later, that area was underwater.",卫星图像显示大坝在三个地方被破坏。大约180米的中心区域被摧毁，位于大坝顶部的水力发电厂的一个结构被一分为二。一段无人机视频最初显示，大坝南端的部分区域仍然完好无损。几个小时后，那个区域也没入水中。
"Emergency crews were heading to southern Ukraine from Kyiv, the head of the state emergency service, Serhiy Kruk, said in a statement. Vehicles designed to be driven through floodwaters, generators, mobile water treatment plants, water trucks and other equipment were also on their way. Volunteers from the Red Cross unloaded aid in Mykolaiv. Some military analysts cautioned against assigning blame with limited information.",国家应急部门负责人谢尔希·克鲁克在一份声明中说，紧急救援人员正从基辅前往乌克兰南部。专门用于穿越洪水的车辆、发电机、移动水处理厂、运水车和其他设备也在路上。红十字会的志愿者在尼古拉耶夫卸载援助物资。一些军事分析家告诫不要依据有限的信息来追究责任。
"""It's too early to tell whether this is a deliberate act by Russia or the result of negligence and prior damage inflicted to the dam,"" said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va.","位于弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿的研究机构CNA的俄罗斯研究主任迈克尔·科夫曼说:""是俄罗斯的蓄意行为还是因疏忽和先前的大坝损害造成的结果，现在判断还为时过早。"""
"""This is a disaster that ultimately benefits nobody,"" Mr. Kofman added. ""Russia is responsible because it controlled the dam, and it's actions in Ukraine led to this outcome, one way or another.""","""没有人最终从这场灾难中受益，""科夫曼还说。""俄罗斯负有责任，因为它控制着大坝，而它在乌克兰的行动以某种方式导致了这一结果。"""
"But on Tuesday, Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union's top diplomat, said the disaster represented ""a new dimension of Russian atrocities."" He vowed in a post on Twitter that ""all commanders, perpetrators and accomplices"" would be held accountable for this ""violation"" of international humanitarian law.","但周二，欧盟最高外交官何塞普·博雷尔·丰特列斯表示，这场灾难代表了""俄罗斯暴行的一个新层面""。他在Twitter上发帖称，""所有指挥官、肇事者和同伙""都将对这种""违反""国际人道主义法的行为负责。"
"Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described the dam's destruction as ""ecocide,"" adding: ""Russia destroyed the Kakhovka dam, inflicting probably Europe's largest technological disaster in decades and putting thousands of civilians at risk. This is a war crime""","乌克兰外交部长德米特罗·库列巴将大坝的破坏描述为""生态灭绝""，他还说:""俄罗斯摧毁了卡霍夫卡大坝，可能造成欧洲几十年来最大的技术灾难，并使成千上万的平民处于危险之中。这是令人发指的战争罪行。"""
"China's leaders are set to use a gathering of the top legislature starting Sunday to outline plans to restore public confidence and bolster economic growth after a year of uncertainty, disruption and discontent around the government's Covid restrictions.",中国领导人将利用周日开始的最高立法机关会议概述恢复公众信心、促进经济增长的计划，此前一年，围绕政府的疫情防控措施一直存在着不确定性、混乱和不满。
"The annual session of the largely ceremonial National People's Congress in Beijing is aimed at conveying the ruling Communist Party's confidence and inspiring national unity. For the country's top leader, Xi Jinping, this year's event will also be key to reinforcing his authority after his signature ""zero Covid"" policy, now abandoned, drew widespread protests in November and worsened an economic slowdown.","在北京召开的一年一度的全国人民代表大会基本上是仪式性的，旨在传达执政的共产党的信心，并激励举国上下团结一致。对于中国最高领导人习近平来说，在他标志性的""清零""政策(现已放弃)11月引发了广泛抗议并加剧经济放缓后，今年的人大会议也将是强化其权威的关键。"
"The leadership will lay out its agenda for addressing challenges such as mounting local government debt, unemployment, a housing slump, weak exports and a shrinking population. Delegates are expected to rubber-stamp decisions made in advance, behind closed doors, by leaders of the party who hold ultimate authority.","领导层将提出施政计划以应对挑战，例如日益增长的地方债、失业、房市低迷、出口疲软和人口萎缩。预计人大代表将会""走过场""，批准持有最终权力的领导人事先闭门做出的决定。"
"At the end of the gathering, which runs for nine days, Mr. Xi is all but assured to be appointed to another five-year term as president after securing a groundbreaking third term as party leader in October. He is also expected to appoint his loyalists and allies to key government positions.",习近平在去年10月突破性地确立了他的第三个党总书记任期，在九天的人大会议结束时，几乎可以肯定他将再次连任五年国家主席。预计他还会任命忠实的追随者和盟友担任重要的政府职位。
Here's what to expect from the legislative gathering.,以下是我们对此次大会的预测。
The party will probably defend its handling of Covid.,中共将捍卫其新冠应对方式。
"The gathering will be the first since China abruptly lifted ""zero Covid,"" a deeply unpopular policy of lockdowns and quarantines.","这是中国突然取消""清零""政策后的第一次人大会议，该政策使用封锁和隔离措施，非常不得人心。"
"In the lead-up to the congress, China's propaganda apparatus has pushed a triumphant narrative declaring that under Mr. Xi's leadership, the party's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic was a ""miracle in human history"" and ""completely correct."" It has emphasized the importance of unity behind the party's leaders.","在大会召开之前，中国的宣传机构推动了一种胜利说，宣称在习近平的领导下，该党对新冠大流行的应对是""人类文明史上的奇迹""，且""完全正确""。它强调团结在党领导人身后的重要性。"
"""As long as the party and the people always stand together, think together, and work together, no storm can shake our steel will, and no difficulty can stop our resolute steps,"" the People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, said on Friday.","党报《人民日报》周五写道:""只要党和人民始终站在一起、想在一起、干在一起，任何风浪都动摇不了我们的钢铁意志，任何困难都阻挡不了我们的铿锵步伐。"""
"Security around the city will be heavy, and traffic will probably be congested as roughly 3,000 delegates from around the country handpicked by the party descend on the capital and convene at the cavernous Great Hall of the People.",随着中共从全国各地精心挑选的大约3000名代表抵达首都，在宏伟的人民大会堂举行会议，北京各处将戒备森严，交通可能会出现拥堵。
"In recent years, delegates had to take Covid tests and wear masks during gatherings. It is unclear how many such restrictions will remain. Despite the nationwide lifting of most Covid limits, foreign journalists invited to cover the congress were told that they had to quarantine overnight to attend some news conferences.",近年来，代表们在大会召开期间必须接受新冠病毒检测并佩戴口罩。目前尚不清楚还会有多少这样的限制。尽管在全国范围内取消了大多数新冠限制措施，但受邀报道大会的外国记者被告知，他们必须隔离一晚才能参加一些新闻发布会。
China will show that it once again cares about growth,中国将再次表现出对增长的关心
"When the meeting opens, the departing premier, Li Keqiang, will deliver a government work report that is expected to include a target of roughly 5 percent in economic growth for the year.",会议开幕时，即将离任的总理李克强将发表一份政府工作报告，预计将包括今年经济增长约5%的目标。
"China's economy had its weakest performance in decades last year, dragged down by lockdowns and then widespread Covid outbreaks in December. Businesses have been rattled in recent years by crackdowns on Big Tech and other sectors, and developers ran out of money as regulators reined inexcessive debt.",受封锁和12月大范围暴发的新冠疫情拖累，去年中国经济出现了几十年来最差的表现。近年来，由于政府对大型科技公司和其他行业的打击，企业深感不安;随着监管机构控制过度举债，房地产开发商资金枯竭。
"In recent weeks, local officials confronted protesters in multiple cities after some municipalities cut health insurance to alleviate a debt crisis. Youth unemployment is high, and the birthrate is at a record low. In January, the country announced its first population decline in six decades.",最近几周，一些城市为缓解债务危机将医保缩水后，出现了警民对峙。年轻人失业率居高不下，出生率创历史新低。今年1月，中国宣布60年来人口首次呈现负增长。
"To juice economic growth, a major pillar of the party's legitimacy, the party is expected to pledge to boost middle-class spending, restore confidence to investors and create new jobs.",为了推动经济增长——这是中共合法性的主要支柱——预计该党将承诺刺激中产阶级消费，恢复投资者信心并创造新的就业机会。
"In a sign of concerns about the fragility of the economy, Chinese officials have adopted business-friendlylanguagethat marks a shift from its emphasis on developing amore state-controlled economy. China analysts will be watching for how the work report balances Mr. Xi's statist direction with pro-growth rhetoric.",出于对经济脆弱性的担忧，中国官员采用了对企业友好的措辞，标志着不再强调发展更多受国家控制的经济。中国分析人士将关注工作报告如何平衡习近平的国家主义方向与支持增长的言论。
China is bracing for a world more wary of Beijing's ambitions,中国正准备迎接一个对其野心更加警惕的世界
"The premier's report will probably reflect Mr. Xi's long-term vision of China's leading role in a more multipolar world, replacing the United States-led international order. Mr. Xi has declared that China's success proved that modernization did not equal Westernization.",总理的报告可能反映出习近平让中国在更加多极化的世界中发挥领导作用的长期愿景，以取代美国主导的国际秩序。习近平宣称，中国的成功证明了现代化不等于西方化。
"For Mr. Xi, this entails reducing the country's reliance on the West for key technologies, building a world-class military, increasing the party's control over the security apparatus, steering the economy and curbing financial risks.",对习近平来说，这需要减少中国在关键技术上对西方的依赖，建立世界一流的军队，加强党对安全机构的控制，引导经济，并遏制金融风险。
"China is facing scrutiny over allegations by the United States that it is considering providing arms and ammunitionto Russia in its war in Ukraine. The United States has imposed sweeping limits on semiconductor exports to China. Many economies are bracing for recession, which will further dampen demand for Chinese exports.",由于美国指控中国正在考虑向俄罗斯提供武器弹药用于乌克兰战争，它正面临着外界的密切关注。美国全面限制了对中国的半导体出口。许多经济体正在为衰退做准备，这将进一步抑制对中国出口产品的需求。
"As the dispute over a Chinese spy balloon last month demonstrated, relations with the United States are more volatile than ever, especially as China takes a more confrontational stance on Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory. Observers will watch the congress for any legislation or subtle signs of shifts in Taiwan policy.",正如上个月关于中国间谍气球的争端所表明的那样，中美关系比以往任何时候都更加不稳定，尤其是在中国对台湾采取更具对抗性的立场之际，北京声称这个自治的岛屿是其领土。观察人士将密切关注这次大会，寻找任何立法或对台政策变化的细微迹象。
Xi's allies are expected to take top jobs in government reshuffle,习近平的盟友有望在政府改组中担任高级职务
"The National People's Congress also finalizes personnel decisions for the premier, vice premiers, state councilors and dozens of ministry-level departments. Some of these were set at a previous party congress, and others have been decided in closed-door sessions ahead of the event.",大会还将决定总理、副总理、国务委员和几十个部级部门的人事任命。其中一些是在之前的党代会上制定的，还有一些是在本次大会之前的闭门会议上决定的。
"Mr. Xi's close ally, Li Qiang, currently No. 2 in the party's top body, the Politburo Standing Committee, is set to take over as premier. As is customary for the premier, the incoming Mr. Li will hold a news conference at the end of the congress, in which reporters' questions are usually vetted beforehand.",习近平的亲密盟友、目前在党的最高机构政治局常委中排名第二的李强将接任总理一职。按照惯例，即将上任的李强将在大会结束时举行新闻发布会，记者的提问通常经过提前审核。
"Analysts are also looking out for other appointments to the leadership of China's economy and financial sectors. They include Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to be executive vice premier. He Lifeng, another close ally to Mr. Xi and head of China's powerful economic policy planning body, is expected to become vice premier; and Zhu Hexin, a veteran banker, might be tapped to run China's central bank.",分析人士还在关注中国经济和金融部门领导层的其他任命。其中，丁薛祥有望出任常务副总理。习近平的另一位亲密盟友、中国强大的经济政策规划机构负责人何立峰有望成为副总理;资深银行家朱鹤新可能会被任命为中国央行的负责人。
"""They are all people who really are party people, first and foremost, and, of course, close associates of Xi Jinping,"" said Tony Saich, a China specialist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. ""It's really a departure of the whole Western-educated, globally integratedofficials, who basically are all timed out and retired.""","""他们首先都是党员，当然，也是习近平的亲密伙伴，""哈佛大学肯尼迪政府学院的中国问题专家托尼·赛奇说。""受过西方教育、全球一体化的官员确实是在整体离场，他们基本上都已经任满并且退休了。"""
"Female leaders have become more scarce under Mr. Xi's tenure. For the first time in decades, the top 24 members of the party are all men. Shen Yiqin, a former party chief of the southwestern province of Guizhou, may be named a state councilor.",在习近平的任期内，女性领导人变得更少了。党内最高级别的24名成员都是男性，这是几十年来的第一次。贵州省前省委书记谌贻琴可能被任命为国务委员。
The party has also signaled a major institutional shake-up that will help carry out Mr. Xi's agenda by entrenching the party deeper into state ministries and Chinese society by extension.,党还发出了重大机构调整的信号，这将有助于执行习近平的议程，进一步加强中共对国家部委和中国社会的控制。
"Few details have been released so far, but at a meeting of national leaders on Tuesday, Mr. Xi called for ""deepening reform of the party and state institutions."" China watchers are discussing changes that could see China's sprawling security apparatus and financial watchdogs fall under closer supervision by Mr. Xi and the party.","迄今为止公布的细节很少，但在周二的国家领导人会议上，习近平呼吁""深化党和国家机构改革""。中国的观察者正在讨论一些变化，它们可能会使中国庞大的安全机构和金融监督机构处于习近平和党的更密切的监督之下。"
"""Xi Jinping has a pretty sizable set of goals he wants the party-state to achieve between now and 2035,"" said Jude Blanchette, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank. Frustrations with a sprawling Chinese bureaucracy are ""driving these heavy-handed interventions,"" he said.","""习近平有一套相当可观的目标，从现在开始，他希望党和国家能在2035年之前实现，""智库战略与国际研究中心的中国问题专家白明(Jude Blanchette)说。他表示，对庞大中国官僚机构的不满""推动了这些强硬的干预措施""。"
"In its single-minded pursuit of the ""zero Covid"" strategy, the Chinese government was omnipresent and omnipotent, using its unlimited resources and unchecked power to control the nation. After having nearly exhausted its resources and the good will of the public, the government has now simply disappeared, just as many Chinese are getting very ill with the virus or dying from it.","在一心实施""清零""战略的过程中，中国政府仿佛无所不在、无所不能，用无限的资源和不受限制的权力来控制国家。在几乎耗尽资源和公众的善意之后，在许多中国人感染这种病毒而出现重症或因此而死亡时，政府却消失了。"
"For much of this year, Yang, an engineer in Shenzhen, took Covid tests nearly every day, from one of the more than 40 government-built booths in his neighborhood. Whenever he missed one, he would get text reminders from his district. After buying pain relief medication, he got calls from three different community workers because the state had strict rules about the sale of such over-the-counter drugs.",在今年的大部分时间里，在深圳当工程师的杨先生几乎每天都要在他家附近政府设立的40多个检测站中的一个进行核酸检测。每错过一次，他都会收到他所在区的短信提醒。在买了止痛药后，他接到了三个不同社区工作人员的电话，因为国家对这种非处方药的销售有严格的规定。
"Since the Chinese leadership abruptly abandoned its stringent ""zero Covid"" policy several weeks ago, Mr. Yang has rarely heard from the government.","自中国领导层几周前突然放弃严格的""清零""政策以来，杨先生很少听到来自政府的消息。"
"""No one is in charge now,"" said Mr. Yang, who asked to be identified only by his surname because of safety concerns. His daughter's school was still open last week even though most students were staying home, either because they were ill or worried about getting sick. There's no national mask mandate. People with mild symptoms are showing up at work because no one bothers to check in on them anymore. Medicines are in short supply, so Mr. Yang is sharing what he has with friends. His family has four rapid test kits, which are being saved until they're really needed.","""现在没人管了，""杨先生说。出于安全考虑，他要求只透露自己的姓。他女儿的学校上周仍在上课，尽管大多数学生都呆在家里，要么是因为生病了，要么是因为担心生病。国家不再强制戴口罩。有轻微症状的人会出现在工作场所，因为再也没有人关心他们的身体情况了。药品短缺，所以杨先生把药品分给朋友们。他的家里有四份快速检测试剂盒，是留到关键时刻的。"
"For a powerful government that likes to brag about its command of the country and has published a four-volume compilation of speeches and articles by its top leader titled ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China,"" the absence of direction at a moment of crisis has made the public question the legitimacy and the credibility of the Chinese Communist Party.",对于一个喜欢吹嘘对国家的掌控，并出版了最高领导人四卷本讲话和文章汇编《习近平谈治国理政》的强大政府来说，在危机时刻没有方向，使公众对中国共产党的合法性和可信度产生了怀疑。
It also highlights a crucial but not always obvious distinction in leadership.,它还突显了领导力中一个至关重要但并不总是很明显的区别。
"""The ability to control is different from the ability to govern,"" Chen Tianyong, an entrepreneur, wrote on his social media WeChat timeline last week.","""管控能力不等于社会治理能力，""企业家陈天庸上周在微信朋友圈写道。"
"Xu Kaizhen, a best-selling author famous for novels that explore the intricate workings of China's bureaucratic politics, wrote on his verified Weibo account that the abrupt change made it abundantly clear ""what our government will do, what it likes to do, what it can do, what it doesn't like to do, what it can't do and what it doesn't want to do.""","以探索中国官僚政治复杂运作的小说而闻名的畅销书作家许开祯在他的认证微博账户上写道，这种突然的变化非常清楚地表明，""我们的政府究竟会干什么爱干什么能干什么不爱干什么不会干什么不愿干什么。"""
"If good governance is about transparency, responsibility, accountability and responsiveness to the needs of the people, the Chinese government has barely practiced it, either in its harsh ""zero Covid"" policy, or in its haphazard reopening.","如果说善治意味着透明、负责、问责和对人民需求的回应，那么中国政府几乎没有践行这一点，无论是在严厉的""清零""政策中，还是在杂乱无章的重新开放中。"
"It could have spent its resources on increasing vaccine coverage among older people and adding I.C.U. beds. Instead, it spent money on mass Covid testing and building enormous quarantine camps.",它本可以把资源花在提高老年人的疫苗覆盖率和增加重症监护室床位上。然而，它把钱花在了大规模的新冠检测和建造巨大的方舱上。
"It could have communicated scientific facts about symptoms and death rates of the Omicron variant. Instead, it fanned fears about Covid.",它本可以传达关于奥密克戎变种的症状和死亡率的科学事实。然而，它煽动人们对新冠的恐惧。
"It could have stocked up on fever medicines and provided the public with the best vaccines available. Instead, it made it extremely difficult for people to buy antipyretics and didn't approve the public use of foreign mRNA vaccines, which have proven more effective than the Chinese ones in preventing severe symptoms.",它本可以储备退烧药，并向公众提供最好的疫苗。然而，它让人们很难买到退烧药，并且没有批准公众使用国外的mRNA疫苗，这些疫苗已经被证明在预防重症方面比中国的疫苗更有效。
"Unlike many governments that took steps to flatten the infection curve before reopening, the Chinese government suddenly let go of nearly all restrictions, most likely an effort to rush an enormous country to herd immunity while leaving the old and vulnerable in precarious situations.",与许多政府在重新开放前采取措施压平感染曲线不同，中国政府突然取消了几乎所有的限制，很可能是为了让一个庞大的国家迅速实现群体免疫，而这会把老年人和弱势群体置于危险境地。
"Its main advice to the public: ""You're in charge of your own health."" The slogan has since earlier this year been promoted and repeated by state media and local governments since the reopening.","它对公众的主要建议是:""每个人都是自己健康的第一责任人。""自今年早些时候重新开放以来，官方媒体和地方政府一直在宣传和重复这一口号。"
"But the pandemic is a public health crisis, and such crises are part of the reason governments exist.",但这场大流行是一场公共卫生危机，而这种危机正是政府存在的原因之一。
"The change in pandemic control strategy doesn't mean the government ""can sit on its hands,"" Wu Jinglian, a top Chinese economist known for advocating for smaller government, told the Caixin magazine. It ""must avoid going from one extreme to the other.""","以倡导小政府而闻名的中国顶级经济学家吴敬琏在接受《财新》杂志采访时表示，疫情控制策略的变化并不意味着政府""无所作为""。它""必须避免从一个极端走向另一个极端""。"
"Qin Liwen, a former journalist, wrote on her WeChat timeline: ""Only when a government does what it's supposed to do, can the people be responsible for themselves.""","前记者覃里雯在她的微信上写道:""只有政府把该做的做好了，人民才能自己负责自己。"""
"The local governments haven't been doing much either. Many officials are probably waiting for guidance from their superiors. ""Zero Covid"" could be quantified so everyone knew what to do. In a top-down system like the Communist Party, the underlings are often at a loss for what to do when the big boss doesn't set a goal.","地方政府也没有采取什么措施。许多官员可能在等待上级的指示。""清零""可以量化，这样每个人都知道该怎么做。在共产党这样一个自上而下的体制下，当上级没有设定目标时，下属往往会不知所措。"
"For weeks, Mr. Xi said nothing about the end of the country's ""zero Covid"" policy, which was considered his signature campaign. On Monday, in his first public comment on the dismantling of ""zero Covid,"" Mr. Xi was vague, saying that China's epidemic prevention and control was facing new situations and tasks. He urged the public to ""develop good personal hygiene habits"" and ""practice a civilized and healthy lifestyle."" His remarks didn't mention either the high infection rates or the death counts.","几周来，习近平对结束中国的""清零""政策只字未提，该政策被认为是他的标志性运动。周一，在他对取消""清零""的首次公开讲话中，习近平含糊其辞，说中国的疫情防控正面临新的形势和任务。他敦促公众""养成良好的个人卫生习惯""，""践行文明健康的生活方式""。他的讲话既没有提到高感染率，也没有提到死亡人数。"
It would be wise for the officials to wait for his directive. But the public can't wait.,官员们等待他的指示是明智之举。但公众不能等待。
"Emotions are running high as millions of people are becoming infected every day, leaving pharmacy shelves empty, medical workers overwhelmed and morgues full.",群情激愤，因为每天都有数百万人被感染，药店货架空空如也，医务人员不堪重负，停尸房堆满尸体。
"""The virus wasn't eliminated to zero,"" a recent Weibo comment said. ""The government's credibility has been reduced to zero.""","""病毒并没有被清零，""最近一条微博评论说。""是政府的可信度被清零。"""
"A widely circulated WeChat article speculated that the shortage of fever medications reflected the government's lack of preparation for loosening control. And if the government had shown the same political will that it had in implementing ""zero Covid,"" the article argued, it could have ensured there was ample supply of such medication.","微信上一篇广为流传的文章推测，发烧药物的短缺反映了政府对放松管制缺乏准备。文章认为，如果政府表现出跟实施""清零""同样的政治意愿，本可以确保这种药物的充足供应。"
"""It doesn't care about the ordinary people, leaving them to fend for themselves and even delighting in their chaos,"" the article said, and it urged officials to show up where the public most needed them to win back trust.","文章说，""对老百姓不管不顾，任由自生自灭，甚至抱着看笑话的心理放任自流。""文章敦促官员出现在公众最需要他们的地方，以赢回信任。"
"The low confidence in the government is forcing people to help themselves and help one another. In local WeChat groups, people made arrangements to share their fever medicines and rapid test kits with their neighbors.",对政府没有信心迫使人们自助和互相帮助。在本地微信群中，人们与邻居分享退烧药和快速检测试剂盒。
"Tencent, the social media giant, also built a WeChat program where people could ask for medications from strangers with extra. The help requests are modest: six tablets of acetaminophen; four tablets of ibuprofen; two rapid test kits; one thermometer.",社交媒体巨头腾讯也建立了一个微信项目，帮助人们向有富余药物的陌生人寻求帮助。要求并不高:六片对乙酰氨基酚;四片布洛芬;两套快速检测试剂盒;一个温度计。
They are asking strangers for help because they're not getting it from their government.,他们向陌生人寻求帮助，因为他们无法从政府那里得到帮助。
"""Don't expect anything from Leviathan there's no point in appealing, either,"" Chen Min, a former journalist better known by his pen name, Xiao Shu, wrote on his WeChat timeline, referring to the central government. ""In the end, we have to help ourselves.""","笔名""笑蜀""的前记者陈敏在微信上写道:""对利维坦就不要有任何指望了。呼吁也没有意义。""利维坦指的是中央政府。""归根结底还是靠自救。"""
"Only by building an extensive network of social connections, he continued, ""can we weave a real social safety net in the darkest moment, build a real Noah's ark and save countless lives.""","他还说，只有建立一个广泛的社会横向联系，""才能在至暗时刻编织出真正的社会安全网，打造出真正的诺亚方舟，拯救无数生灵。"""
This is exactly the type of governance crisis about which Mr. Xi had once warned the party.,这正是习近平曾经警告过的一种共产党的治理危机。
"""It is not up to us to judge our party's governance capacity or performance; they must and can only be judged by the people,"" Mr. Xi said in a speech in 2013. ""If we are pretentious and divorce ourselves from the people or put ourselves above them, we will surely be abandoned by them.

"They posted photos of their positive Covid tests on social media. They described their symptoms as if it were something to be celebrated: fever, cough, fatigue, body ache, loss of taste and smell. They talked about how wonderful it was to no longer be afraid of being sent to quarantine camps for infections and to no longer have to worry about neighbors being locked down for weeks as a result.",他们在社交媒体上发核酸结果呈阳性的照片。他们描述自己的症状时好像那是值得庆祝的事情:发烧、咳嗽、疲劳、身体疼痛、丧失味觉和嗅觉。他们说，很高兴不用再担心被送去隔离，不用再担心牵连邻居被关在家里数周时间。

"Since the government abruptly dropped its stringent ""zero Covid"" restrictions last week in the face of rare nationwide protests, much of the Chinese public has embraced a new life. They have been eager to gain back some of their basic rights, even if it means the virus is now spreading quickly.","自从全国各地罕见地爆发了抗议活动、政府于上周突然放弃严厉的""新冠清零""政策以来，许多中国老百姓已接受了新生活。他们一直渴望重新获得一些基本权利，尽管这意味着新冠病毒目前正在迅速传播。"
"But beneath the relief is a collective and profound trauma that will not be easy to heal. Gripped with grief, anxiety and depression, people want a national reckoning of what went wrong. Many are now on an almost quixotic quest in the belief that the government should acknowledge its harsh policies were a severe mistake and should apologize for the harm it has caused.",但在宽慰之下是一种集体的、难以治愈的深深创伤。被悲伤、焦虑和抑郁笼罩着的人民想对国家出了什么问题算一个总帐。一些人现在甚至近乎异想天开地认为，政府应该承认严厉的清零政策是个严重的错误，并应该为政策造成的伤害道歉。
"Li Gongming, an art historian and a former member of a political advisory group run by the Chinese Communist Party, posted an article on the social media platform WeChat, urging the government of the southern city of Guangzhou to help heal the emotional and social wounds from the pandemic.",艺术史学家、前政协委员李公明在微信上发文，敦促南方城市广州的当地政府帮助愈合疫情造成的情感和社会创伤。

"Social media users called out some of the top health experts who talked up the dangers of the omicron variant to support the government's ""zero Covid"" policy, only to change their messages after the 180-degree policy change. People circulated screenshots of different headlines of the official People's Daily in recent months, joking that the newspaper is always right on the day it is published, but it contradicts itself when it's later bound together with other editions.",社交媒体用户点了几个国内著名卫生专家的名字，这些人曾为支持政府的清零政策夸大奥密克戎变异株的危险，但在政策出现180度大转弯后，他们又改变了说辞。网上疯传官媒《人民日报》近几个月来截然不同的大标题的截图，人们开玩笑说，该报当天看都正确，但合订本就自相矛盾了。
People I interviewed told me that they want the government to apologize because it would offer some comfort for what they have endured.,接受采访的人告诉我，他们希望政府道歉，因为这能为他们承受的一切提供一些安慰。
"Zhang, a college senior in eastern Jiangsu Province who asked to be identified only by her surname, has had to take more than 100 Covid tests this year and was locked down for a total of four months, including much of the fall semester. She feels depressed, finds it hard to become motivated and cries easily when reading news about Covid.",一名要求我只写她姓张的江苏省大四学生说，她今年已被迫做了100多次核酸，前前后后被封控的时间加起来有四个月，包括秋季学期的大部分时间。她感到抑郁、消极，读到新冠病毒的新闻时动不动会哭。
"She believed the government's misinformation about the pandemic in the West, so she supported locking down Shanghai in April, a position she now regrets. Now knowing better, she wants the party to apologize to ""all the innocent people who died under 'zero Covid,' people who lost their income under lockdowns and all the people who were brainwashed by the propaganda machine,"" she said.","她曾相信政府传播的关于西方疫情的错误信息，并因此支持今年4月的上海封城。她现在对当初的立场表示后悔。她说，现在知道的更多了，她想让中共为""对于那些在清零中无辜死去、因长期封控失去收入的人以及被政治机器洗脑的所有人，政府都应该认错并道歉""。"
"Like Ms. Zhang, most people I interviewed for this column only want to be identified by a single name for safety concerns.",本专栏采访的大多数人与张女士一样，出于安全考虑要求不使用全名。
"In a normal society, for a policy mistake as severe as ""zero Covid,"" the public would demand more than an apology, said Yan, a project manager at an internet company in Beijing. ""They would have wanted a new ruling party. But it's a different matter in the Chinese context.""","北京一家互联网公司的项目经理言(音)说，在正常社会里，对像""新冠清零""这样的严重政策错误，公众要求的不会只是道歉。""岂止是道歉，还要换一个党来执政了。但在我们这个语境下不是这么回事。"""
"Everybody I talked to believes that the government should apologize, but no one expects it will. The Communist Party can only be ""great, glorious and correct,"" they said, per its own description in many official speeches. And Xi Jinping, the country's top leader, has silenced nearly all dissent and criticism of his leadership.","跟我聊过的所有人都认为政府应该道歉，但没有人指望政府会这样做。他们说，中共只能是""伟光正""，这是许多官方讲话对中共的描述。而且，中国最高领导人习近平已把对中共领导层的异见和批评几乎全部压制下去了。"
"""The call for apology is very brave, and I want it, too,"" said Yan. ""But it's very unlikely to happen.""","""这种呼声非常勇敢，我也希望能看到道歉，""言说。 ""但是小概率事件。"""
"The Communist Party has never apologized to the Chinese people for any of the atrocities they have suffered during its 73 years in power. Not after more than 20 million people starved to death during the disastrous Great Leap Forward, nor when the country was thrown into a decade of chaos and economic destruction by the Cultural Revolution. And not for the one-child policy that imposed many forced abortions and is now helping foment a demographic crisis with one of the fastest aging populations in the world.",在执政的73年里，中共从来没有为中国人民在其统治下遭受的任何残暴行为道过歉。没有为灾难性的大跃进导致逾2000万人饿死道过歉。没有为文化大革命使国家陷入长达十年的混乱和经济崩溃道过歉。也没有为独生子女政策道过歉，这项政策导致了许多强制堕胎，促使中国成为世界上人口老龄化最快并面临人口危机的国家之一。
"The party even killed a literary genre called ""scar literature,"" which emerged after the Cultural Revolution in late 1970s and portrayed the sufferings that people endured during that political campaign. The party never wants anybody to focus too much on their scars because they would inevitably ask where the scars came from, said Xu Chenggang, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China's Economic and Institutions who was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution.","中共甚至扼杀了被称为""伤痕文学""的文学类型。伤痕文学出现在文革后的20世纪70年代末，写的是人们在那场政治运动中遭受的苦难。斯坦福大学中国经济与制度中心高级研究学者许成钢说，中共从来不希望有人过度关注他们的伤痕，因为他们会不可避免地想知道伤痕是从哪里来的。许成钢曾在文革期间遭受迫害。"
"Hu Xijin, a top party propagandist, senses dangers in all the demands for an apology. In a long article on the social media platform Weibo, where he has nearly 25 million followers, he wrote that the people who called the ""zero Covid"" policy a ""man-made disaster"" are too ""radical.""","中共高级吹鼓手胡锡进意识到了要求道歉的所有危险。他在自己拥有近2500万粉丝的社交媒体平台微博上发的一篇长文中写道，将""新冠清零""政策称为""人祸""的人""偏激""了。"
"The post triggered an outcry of anger and disappointment. Many college students noted that they felt like prisoners on their campuses. A commenter from Shanghai said their child was locked down in a 600-square-foot apartment for three months. ""Isn't this something that we should reflect on? Shouldn't we try to stop this from happening again and keep the power on check?"" the commenter asked.","胡锡进的文章引发了大片愤怒和失望的声音。许多大学生指出，他们感觉自己在校园里是囚徒。一个来自上海的评论留言说，他们的孩子被关在一个55平米的公寓里三个月。""不应该反思吗?不应该杜绝这种乱象，把权力关进笼子里?""评论者问道。"
"The party has stepped in to control the narrative. In a front-page commentary on Thursday, the People's Daily, the party's official newspaper, talked up how the country is coming back to life. Then it spent more than 10,000 words praising how the party and Mr. Xi guided the country through the pandemic.",中共已加强了对叙事的控制。中共喉舌《人民日报》周四在头版发表的评论中，大谈特谈国家正在如何恢复生机，然后用了一万多字赞扬中共和习近平如何带领国家度过了新冠疫情。
"""Practice has fully proved that the Communist Party of China,"" it said, ""is the most reliable backbone of the Chinese people when storms strike.""","""实践充分证明，中国共产党，""文章写道，""是风雨来袭时中国人民最可靠的主心骨。"""
"It is a clear signal that the government will stick to its victorious messaging. It wants the public to accept its narrative, forget about what happened to them and move on.",这是一个明确的信号，表明政府将坚持宣传自己获得胜利的信息。它想让公众接受这种叙事，忘掉发生在他们身上的事情，接受现实。
Some have anticipated such moves and are determined to fight back against the collective amnesia that the nation has suffered for too long. It's their own way to cope with the trauma.,一些人对这种做法已有预料，并决心要抵制这个国家长期遭受的集体失忆症。用他们自己的方式应对创伤。
"Yu, a programmer in his mid-30s, chokes up whenever he talks about the lockdown in Shanghai in the spring of this year. ""I felt like I was knocked down by the government and hammered for three months,"" he said. ""Then it told me that it did it for the sake of my well-being.""","30多岁的程序员余(音)每当谈起今年春天的上海封城时都会哽咽。""我感觉被按在地上拿铁锤锤了三个月，""他说。""然后它还说是为了你好。"""
"He is still having two recurring nightmares. In one, he would be in a war zone full of barbed wires and filled with poisonous air. In the other, he would hear a monotonous voice repeatedly blasting from a loudspeaker, ""Come down to get tested for Covid."" Then would come his test results: negative, positive, negative, positive.","他仍有两个反复出现的噩梦。在一个噩梦里，他身处布满铁丝网和有毒空气的战区。在另一个噩梦里，他会听到大喇叭里的一个单调声音不断大喊，""下来做核酸。""然后是的检测结果:阴性、阳性、阴性、阳性。"
"He believes that it's important to write down what happened. He spent the summer on an electronic book, compiling government announcements and credible online information about what happened to the 25 million Shanghai residents between March and July. He believes that it would be obvious to anybody how much the government lied and how brutally it treated the people.",他认为把发生了事情记录下来很重要。他花了整个夏天写了一本电子书，搜集了政府的公告和可靠的在线信息，讲述了2500万上海居民今年3月到7月的遭遇。他相信所有的人都明白政府撒了多少谎，对待人民的做法有多么残酷。
"""It was like an absurd nightmare,"" he wrote in the introduction. ""I can't help but ask why tragedies like this keep happening to the Chinese people.""","""仿佛做了一个荒诞的噩梦，""他在序中写道。""不由感叹类似的悲剧为何在中国老百姓身上一再重演。"""
"If brevity is the soul of wit, as some wag once said, maybe no words is the wittiest option of all. Late in November, at least 10 people died in a high-rise fire in Urumqi, the regional capital of Xinjiang, in western China. It was widely believed that Covid restrictions prevented the victims from escaping, and anger spilled into the streets, first in Urumqi and then across China, where stringent anti-Covid measures have subjected citizens to home lockdowns, constant testing and confinement in grim quarantine centers. Demonstrators appeared in cities and on college campuses, criticizing Covid policies or even denouncing the Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping. Many brandished a symbol of protest: plain, unmarked sheets of white paper.",有人曾说，简洁是智慧的灵魂，那或许，无言才是最明智的选择。11月下旬，中国西部新疆的首府乌鲁木齐市一幢高层建筑发生火灾，造成至少10人丧生。民众普遍认为，是新冠防控措施导致遇难者未能逃离，愤怒情绪蔓延至街头，首先是在乌鲁木齐，然后发展到全国各地，严苛的防疫迫使公民被封在家中，不断接受核酸检测，并被关进条件恶劣的隔离中心。城市中和大学校园里出现了示威者，他们批评新冠政策，甚至要求中共及其领导人习近平下台。许多人手里拿着一个抗议的标志:普普通通、什么都没写的白纸。
"Transfixing videos emerged. At a vigil in Shanghai, mourners held sheets of paper aloft as candles flickered. Students at Beijing's Tsinghua University wielded sheets of paper and bellowed slogans calling for democracy and freedom of expression. At another Beijing rally, a crowd waved blank paper while chanting against Covid protocols. One much-shared tweet featured someone hurling stacks of paper into the air amid city traffic. Another viral clip showed a dramatic piece of street theater: a young woman marching among pedestrians holding a sheet of paper, her mouth covered with black tape, her wrists bound with chains.",网上出现了令人惊叹的视频。在上海的一场守夜活动，哀悼者在烛光中举起白纸。北京清华大学的学生挥舞着白纸，大喊着民主和言论自由的口号。在北京的另一场集会上，一群人拿着白纸，高声反对新冠政策。一条广为流传的推文展示了有人在城市车流中向空中抛洒一叠叠白纸的场面。另一条得到大量转发的视频则显示了街头的戏剧性场面:一名年轻女子拿着一张纸在人群中游行，她的嘴上贴着黑色胶带，手腕上绑着铁链。
"Commentators were quick to interpret the meaning of the ""white-paper protests."" A blank sign is both a symbol and a tactic. It is a passive-aggressive protest against censorship, a sarcastic performance of compliance that signals defiance. Its power rests in a shared understanding, by both the public and the authorities, of the unwritten message; it rests also in the awareness that to say anything at all is to run afoul of a government that brooks no opposition, suppressing even the suggestion of an intention to speak. A tweet posted days after the fire showed a photo of a man, apparently in a Shanghai mall, holding a sign reading, ""You know what I want to say."" According to the tweet, he was taken away by the police.","评论人士很快开始解读""白纸抗议""的内涵。空白既是一种象征，也是一种策略。这是对审查制度的一种消极攻击式抗议，是一种带有讽刺意味的顺从，实际上表达了反抗。它的力量在于公众和当局对未写信息的共识;也在于这样一种认知，即只要说话，就等于是在违抗这个不能容忍任何反对意见、连发声意图都要压制的政府。火灾发生数日后的一条推文展示了照片中的身处上海某购物中心的一名男子，他举了一块牌子，上面写着:""你知道我要说什么。""那条推文称，他已被警方带走。"
"In the days after the fire, Chinese Communist Party censors moved to expunge hashtags like ""A4Revolution"" (a reference to the size of the paper) and ""white paper exercise"" from social media. A sheet of paper may be the ultimate ""analog"" artifact, but it has emerged as an unusually potent digital-age totem a meme that is rebounding in fascinating ways between the street and the virtual world. For all the tumult at the barricades, the white signs may reveal more about algorithms, data flow and the way images and ideas resonate online.","火灾发生后，中共的审查人员开始在社交媒体上删除""A4革命""(A4是纸张的尺寸)和""白纸运动""等话题。一张纸或许是最好的""类比""物，但它已成为一种异常强大的数字时代图腾——即以极为有趣的形式折返于街头和虚拟世界的米姆。尽管路障附近有种种混乱，但这些白色标志可能更多地揭示了关于算法、数据流以及影像和思想在网上引发共鸣的方式。"
"The antecedents of white-paper protests stretch back at least as far as 1924, when a Krakow newspaper reportedly published a blank special supplement as a satirical rebuke to censors. In 1965, an episode of ""Candid Camera"" featured a prank in which protesters with blank placards picketed in front of a vacant lot in New York. Four years later, students at a high school in Toronto held a mock sit-in featuring blank signs and a blank list of ""demands."" An Associated Press report about the protest bore the cheeky headline "" , Students Demand.""","白纸抗议的先例最早能追溯到1924年，据称当时克拉科夫市一家报纸出版了一份空白的特刊，作为对审查人员的讽刺谴责。1965年，《偷拍》(Candid Camera)有一集内容讲的就是抗议者的恶作剧，他们拿着空白的标语牌在纽约一处空地前聚集。四年后，多伦多一所高中的学生举行了一次模拟静坐示威，亮出了空白标语和空白的""诉求""清单。美联社给这场抗议的报道安了一个恶搞标题——《学生诉求》。"
"In retrospect, those 1960s stunts seem ideologically conservative: They were parodies, staged at the height of the civil rights era and the Vietnam War, that mocked the very idea of protest. But in recent times, citizens have turned the comedy of blank signs in the opposite direction. The signs have been used as props in pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, and by Russian opponents of the Ukraine invasion. In September, following Queen Elizabeth's death, anti-monarchy demonstrators were reportedly arrested in Scotland. Soon more protesters appeared now carrying blank signs.",回头再看，上世纪60年代的那些噱头在意识形态上似乎是保守的:那是在民权时代和越战期间矛盾最激烈之时上演的拙劣模仿，嘲讽的正是抗议的概念本身。但近年来，公民已将空白标志代表的诙谐含义反转。香港的民主示威、反对入侵乌克兰的俄罗斯人都使用过这种标志。9月，在伊丽莎白女王去世后，有报道称反君主制示威者在苏格兰被捕。很快就出现了更多举着空白标志的抗议者。
"These signs tell an absurdist joke, ridiculing both censorship and those who enforce it. They function as bait: When security forces often uniformed and well armed detain a citizen holding a blank sign, the paranoia and irrationality of state power is thrown into relief. Like a shrewd act of internet trolling, the blank sign is a button-pusher that lures its target into a revealing self-own.",这些标志都代表了荒诞的玩笑，嘲笑了审查制度及其执行者。它们就像一种诱饵:当通常穿着制服、装备精良的安全部队抓捕一位举着空白标志的公民，国家权力的妄想症和非理性就会暴露无遗。这就像网络水军的精明计谋一样，空白标志是诱使目标自我暴露的开关。
"Traditional protest symbols, like banners and flags, may have less currency in the social media age. The emblems that capture the imagination tend to be humble and unexpected, with the feel of organic memes, like the umbrellas used as shields in Hong Kong. Often, these symbols strike notes of irony and absurdity. In Thailand, pro-democracy demonstrators have embraced an even more unlikely icon than white paper: inflatable rubber ducks.",横幅和旗帜这种传统的抗议标志在社交媒体时代可能已经不再通用。激发想象力的标志往往是谦和而又出乎意料的，就像某种生动的米姆，例如在香港被当作盾牌使用的雨伞。这些符号通常带有讽刺和荒诞的意味。在泰国，民主示威者选择了一个比白纸更夸张的标志:充气橡皮鸭。
"China's blank signs have proved to be superlative meme-fodder. T-shirts have popped up featuring an illustration of Winnie-the-Pooh reading a blank page a double joke aimed at Xi Jinping, who was likened to A.A. Milne's roly-poly bear in memes that are banned on the Chinese internet. The signs have inspired more ambitious spectacles. Ai Weiwei, the exiled Chinese artist, posted an Instagram video in which he is shown writing a free-speech message on blank paper in UV invisible ink. A performance-art piece featured a woman covered in white paper being sprayed with red paint by a person in a hazmat suit reminiscent of China's P.P.E.-clad ""big whites.""","中国的空白标志已被证明是绝佳的米姆素材。印着在阅读空白纸张的小熊维尼的T恤已经出现，这是嘲讽习近平的双重笑话，将他比作A·A·米恩创作的滚圆小熊的米姆，在中国互联网上被封禁。这些标志激发了更多雄心勃勃的奇观。流亡的中国艺术家艾未未发布了一段Instagram视频，他在其中用紫外线隐形墨水在白纸上写下了关于言论自由的信息。在一场行为艺术表演中，一名身披白纸女子被身穿防护服的人——让人联想到中国裹在个人防护服之下的""大白""——喷上红漆。"
"Internet battles between protesters and the powers that be are heightened in China, where the internet is heavily censored and a surveillance dragnet sweeps up life online and off. From the moment protests erupted in Urumqi, skirmishes began between users uploading images of demonstrations and the state's censorship apparatus, which worked to obliterate all traces of them. Users employed trickery to evade the algorithms designed to catch outlawed content: They recorded videos of videos, or rotated them on their sides, or used V.P.N.s to ""store"" data on sites like Twitter and Instagram, outside the purview of Chinese censors. These efforts to find cracks in the country's ""great firewall"" have been essential to the protests. There is reason to believe they have been a success: The Chinese government has since taken steps to curb its strict Covid guidelines.","在互联网受到严格审查、天网监控着线上和线下一切日常的中国，抗议者与当权者之间的网络斗争愈演愈烈。从乌鲁木齐爆发抗议的一刻起，上传示威图片和试图抹掉所有痕迹的国家审查机器就爆发了冲突。网民试图骗过旨在捕捉非法内容的算法:他们翻录视频，或是将视频反转，要么就使用VPN在Twitter和Instagram这种不受中国审查控制的网站""存放""数据。这些在中国""防火长城""中寻找裂缝的努力对抗议活动至关重要。有理由相信他们取得了成功:中国政府此后采取措施，取消了严格的新冠防控规定。"
"Of course, protesters may still face harsh consequences, especially those who dared to voice broader critiques of China's authoritarianism. But their criticisms linger in all that white paper, blank signs that carry echoes of ideas from across decades and centuries. There is the famous paradox of John Cage: ""I have nothing to say, and I am saying it."" There's the blank page in Laurence Sterne's ""Tristram Shandy,"" and the white-on-white paintings of Robert Ryman artworks whose eloquent emptiness is pregnant with possibility, expressing the ineffable. The blank sign, for the protester who wields it and the government that disdains it, is full of potential: It is a tabula rasa, upon which every imaginable complaint, exhortation, remonstration, provocation, taunt, threat and irrefutable truth might someday be inscribed. Or maybe it's more accurate to say that those things are already written there figuratively, at least in invisible ink. The signs say nothing; they speak volumes.","当然，抗议者——尤其是那些敢对中国威权提出更广泛批评的人——仍可能面临严峻后果。他们的批判在所有白纸上挥之不去，空白的标志承载了历史长河里回荡的思想。正如约翰·凯奇那句著名的悖论:""我无话可说，而我正在说。""劳伦斯·斯特恩在《项狄传》写下了空白页，罗伯特·瑞曼画出了白底画——艺术作品中空虚的传神蕴藏着可能性，表达了不可言喻的内容。对于挥舞它的抗议者和厌恶它的政府，空白标志充满了力量:它是一块白板，但总有一天上面或许就会出现所有能想象到的抱怨、控诉、抗议、挑衅、嘲讽、威胁和无可辩驳的真理。或者更准确地说，这些东西已经被(至少是象征意义上的)隐形墨水写在上面了。空白标志什么都没说;但它们掷地有声。"
"The narrow alleyways of Haizhu district have long beckoned to China's strivers, people like Xie Pan, a textile worker from a mountainous tea-growing area in central China.",长久以来，海珠区那些逼仄小巷一直吸引着中国的打拼一族，比如来自中国中部产茶山区的纺织工人谢潘(音)。
"Home to one of the country's biggest fabric markets, Haizhu houses worker dormitories and textile factories in brightly colored buildings stacked so close that neighbors can shake hands out their windows. Once a smattering of rural villages, the area became a manufacturing hub as China opened its economy decades ago. The government had promised to step back and let people unleash their ambitions, and millions flocked to Haizhu to do just that.",海珠区是中国最大的纺织品市场之一，工人宿舍和纺织厂坐落于色彩明亮的建筑之中，这些建筑间距很近，邻里之间从窗口能握手。这里曾经只有散落的村庄，但随着中国几十年前开放经济变成了制造业中心。政府承诺放宽管理，让人民追求自己的抱负，涌入海珠区的无数人正是为此而来。
"Mr. Xie made the hopeful journey last year, joining others from Hubei Province who had also settled in this dense pocket of the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. They toiled in cacophonous factories, peddled cloth or sold sesame noodles, a hometown favorite. But when I met him a few months ago, his hope had dimmed. Because of a slowing economy, he had been homeless for two weeks before stringing together money to rent a 100-square-foot room for $120 a month.",去年，谢潘踏上了希望之旅，与其他来自湖北的工人一样，在南方大都市广州这个人口稠密区定居下来。他们在嘈杂的工厂中辛苦劳作，忙于制衣或是兜售家乡名小吃热干面。但几个月前我见到他时，他的希望已经变得渺茫。由于经济放缓，他已经两周无家可归，后来才凑钱以每月800多元的价格租了个10平米见方的单间。
"""There isn't enough work for everyone,"" Mr. Xie, 31, a soft-spoken man with hunched shoulders from years bent over sewing machines, said then. ""You can't go to bed every night having to look for work in the morning. It's too tiring.""","""不是人人都有活干，""31岁的谢潘当时说道。他讲话轻声细语，由于常年在缝纫机前劳作而变得驼背。""没法一觉睡醒就去找工作。太累了。"""
"It would get much worse, after a strict Covid lockdown silenced the factories and shuttered the noodle shops. In October, Mr. Xie was quarantined for nearly a month.",后来情况变得更糟，严格的新冠封锁让工厂停工，面馆纷纷关门。到10月，谢潘被隔离了近一个月时间。
"Several weeks later, Haizhu exploded in discontent. After a weekend of protests against ""zero Covid"" restrictions across the country, hundreds of workers defied lockdown rules and swarmed Haizhu's streets on Tuesday, demanding freedom. They tore down street barricades and threw glass bottles. ""End the lockdown!"" they shouted as police officers in hazmat suits marched through the alleys, banging clubs against their shields.","几周后，海珠区的民怨爆发了。当周末全国各地爆发反对新冠清零限制的抗议，数以百计的工人在周二违抗封锁规定，冲上海珠区街头，要求解封。他们拆除了街上的路障，还投掷玻璃瓶。当穿着防护服的警察穿过街巷，用警棍敲打盾牌时，他们喊道，""解封!"""
"The eruption was a forceful illustration of how thoroughly the world's toughest pandemic restrictions have upended life in China. Xi Jinping, the country's strongman leader, is expanding the Chinese Communist Party's grip over its people beyond what even Mao Zedong attained. Mr. Xi has tied the success of ""zero Covid"" to his own legitimacy as ruler, and enforcing it has taken precedence over nurturing the freewheeling spirit that made Haizhu, and China, so vibrant.","这次爆发有力说明了世界上最严厉的防疫措施如何颠覆了中国人的生活。中国的强人领袖习近平正在扩大中共对民众的控制，其程度更甚于毛泽东时代。习近平将新冠""清零""的成功与他作为统治者的合法性捆绑到一起，强制""清零""已经压过自由开放精神的培养，哪怕后者正是让海珠区以及整个中国生气勃勃的原因。"
"The shift strikes at the party's longstanding social contract with its people. After violently crushing pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989, Beijing struck an implicit bargain: In exchange for limitations on political freedoms, the people would get stability and comfort.",这种转变撕毁了党与人民长期以来达成的社会契约。在1989年暴力镇压天安门的民主示威后，北京达成了一项不言而明的交易:人民要以限制政治自由为代价，换来生活的稳定和舒适。
"But now the stability and comfort have dwindled, even as the limitations have grown. Nearly 530 million people almost 40 percent of the population were under some form of lockdown in late November, according to one estimate. People have died because of delayed medical care, or gone hungry.",但如今，这种稳定和舒适都受到了损害，限制却不断加码。据一项统计，11月下旬，近5.3亿人——也就是总人口的近40%——都处于某种形式的封锁之下。有人食不果腹，有人则因耽误救治丧生。
"Already, China's security apparatus is moving to suppress the demonstrations against ""zero Covid,"" the most widespread protests China has seen since Tiananmen. The police have detained and threatened participants across the country. The government, while not publicly acknowledging the protests, has also tried to blunt public outrage by easing restrictions, including lifting some lockdowns in Guangzhou.","中国的安全机器已经开始镇压反对""清零""的示威活动，这是自天安门事件以来中国发生的最为广泛的抗议。全国各地的警方都在拘捕和威胁参与者。政府虽然没有公开回应这些抗议，但也试图通过放松限制来平息公愤，包括广州的部分解封。"
"Even if Mr. Xi drives discontent back underground, the disillusionment that the protests exposed may remain. ""Zero Covid"" made clear the ease, and apparent arbitrariness, with which the party could and would impose its will on people. For many Chinese, such dominance has shaken their expectation of constant progress, and chipped away at their ambition and willingness to take risks.","但即便习近平能掩盖这些不满情绪，抗议所揭露的幻灭感可能依然存在。""清零""本身就已经表明，党能够且将会轻易和肆意地把自身意志强加于人民。对许多中国人来说，这种颐指气使动摇了他们不断进步的期望，也打击了他们冒险的抱负和意愿。"
"Perhaps nowhere will this shift play out more poignantly than in the biggest metropolises of southern China: Guangzhou and neighboring Shenzhen. It was here where China's market reforms first took off. A colleague and I spent two weeks in the region earlier this year, to see how the changing social contract has fueled frustration, resignation and anxiety feelings starkly at odds with the triumphalist vision of national rejuvenation that Mr. Xi has promoted.",这种转变在中国南方最大的都市广州及毗邻的深圳可能表现得最为深刻。中国的市场改革正是从这里起步。今年早些时候，我与一位同事在该地区待了两周，以了解正在改变的社会契约如何助长了不满、放弃和焦虑——这些情绪都与习近平提倡的民族复兴必胜愿景南辕北辙。
"Mr. Xie was released from quarantine last month, before the recent clashes. He fled Guangzhou, unsure whether he would return. ""This place if I can avoid it, I will.""","谢潘上个月解除了隔离，就在冲突爆发前。他逃离了广州，不确定是否还会回来。""广州这个地方，确实，能不去就尽量不去。"""
A Fading Promise,渺茫的希望
"At the heart of the region's appeal was its promise of something for everyone. There were factories for rural migrants, technology powerhouses for aspiring coders, storefronts for entrepreneurs. Anyone could trade grit and drive for a better life.",这一地区的吸引力在于它能给所有人希望。这里有农民工能去的工厂，有想一展手脚的程序员能去的科技大厂，还有给创业者的商铺。只要有坚韧和干劲，就能过上更好的生活。
"Mr. Xie moved to Guangzhou last year, chasing higher pay to support his two young children. But when he arrived, he found a different hustle than expected.",为了两个年幼的孩子，谢潘去年搬到广州，希望赚到更多钱。但当他来到这里，却发现了意料之外的麻烦。
"Many factories had cut back as the slowing economy and lockdowns choked demand for new clothing. Each morning, Mr. Xie elbowed through nearly standstill crowds of job seekers to haggle with factory bosses over ever-lower rates for piecework, like finishing the hems on a shirt, or the pleats on a skirt. In August, he earned $40 to $50 a day he had heard that people earned double that before the pandemic on the days he earned anything.",由于经济放缓和封锁抑制了人们购新衣的需求，许多工厂已经减产。每天早上，谢潘都要挤过几乎密不透风的求职人群，与工厂老板就越来越低的计件工资讨价还价，这种工作包括给衬衫缝制下摆，或是给裙装打褶。8月时，如果有收入，他每天能赚到两三百元，但他听说疫情前别人的收入是这个数字的两倍。
"At work, he hastily swallowed lunches of white rice and tofu, surrounded by knee-high piles of fabric and the drone of sewing machines.",他边工作边靠米饭和豆腐充饥，周围是齐膝高的一堆堆织物和缝纫机的低鸣。
"Then, in October, the coronavirus began spreading in Haizhu, as did lockdowns. Confined to his room, then to a quarantine center, Mr. Xie's money dried up.",然后到10月，新冠病毒开始在海珠区传播，封锁接踵而至。谢潘先是被关在家中，后来又被关进隔离中心，钱很快就用光了。
"The morning he was released, he boarded a train back to Hubei. ""I've been out of work for so long, I'm about to go hungry,"" Mr. Xie said when reached at home.","解除封控的当天早上，他就登上了返回湖北的火车。""因为现在都失业了，这段时间，马上饿肚子，""回到家中的谢潘表示。"
"It's not just in factories that upward mobility seems increasingly out of reach. The same is true in the region's skyscrapers, once the gleaming proofs of dreams achieved.",向上流动的可能性不仅在工厂变得遥不可及。在这里的摩天大楼也是如此，那曾是梦想成真的光辉证明。
"Before the pandemic, Ryan Liu embodied the promise of his hometown, Shenzhen. After growing up in a working-class family, Mr. Liu, 34, became a product manager at one of China's internet giants. He collected whiskey and vacationed abroad, savoring the high-flying lifestyle that China's modernization made possible.",疫情前，瑞安·刘(音)就代表了他的家乡深圳所承诺的希望。34岁的瑞安·刘在工薪阶层家庭长大，是中国一家互联网巨头的产品经理。他的爱好是收集威士忌和出国度假，享受着中国现代化带来的上流生活方式。
"But ""zero Covid"" bowed even China's internet giants. The e-commerce titan Alibaba reported a net loss of nearly $3 billion last quarter, in part because of weak consumer demand. Tencent, China's most valuable company, laid off thousands of employees this year, the first time in nearly a decade that its work force had shrunk.",但新冠清零让中国互联网巨头也不得不低头。电商巨头阿里巴巴报告上季度净亏损近206亿元，部分原因是消费者需求疲软。中国市值最高的腾讯今年进行了大规模裁员，这是近十年来该公司员工人数首次缩减。
"The comfortable life that Mr. Liu had built for himself suddenly seemed precarious. He had started reading job postings to be safe, he said over a protein bowl near his office in Shenzhen's Hi-Tech Industrial Park, where high-rises offer amenities like karaoke pods and indoor running tracks. He stopped buying whiskey and sold his stock investments.",瑞安·刘为自己创造的舒适生活突然变得岌岌可危。为防意外，他说自己已经开始浏览招聘信息，当时他正在深圳高新技术产业园内的办公室附近吃着沙拉，这里的高层写字楼都设有独立唱K房和室内跑道等便利设施。他不再购买威士忌，并卖掉了股票投资。
"Mr. Liu was now focused on paying off his mortgage and building his savings. ""The next few years,"" he said, ""will also be pretty hard.""","瑞安·刘现在把重点放在了还清贷款和储蓄之上。""因为可以预见到往后几年也会比较困难，""他说。"
'The State Is Everywhere',"""国家无处不在"""
"The sound of construction began immediately after officials detected a lone case of Covid in Xiasha, a dense Shenzhen neighborhood known for its cheap eats and affordable housing. That afternoon, workers hauled sheets of metal and red plastic to erect barriers preventing anyone from leaving a physical manifestation of the party's increasingly overt control over daily life.",下沙是深圳一处人口稠密的社区，以廉价餐饮和经济适用房闻名。当官员们在这里发现一例新冠阳性，施工的声音立即想起。当天下午，工人们运来了金属板和红色塑料板，竖起屏障阻止任何人离开——这实体呈现了党对日常生活愈发明显的控制。
"""Even jail isn't like that,"" said Wu Qunlin, 56, who runs a massage parlor here, recalling the two-week barricade in July his second lockdown this year.","""监狱都没这样，""56岁的吴群林(音)在这里经营一家按摩院，他回忆起7月那次为期两周的封锁时表示，那是他今年第二次被封。"
"Even after the walls came down, the intrusions remained. Covid tests were required every 24 hours. People entering the neighborhood had to show proof of residence. Officials monitored people's movements via their cellphones.",即便在围墙撤走之后，对生活的滋扰依然存在。每24小时就要做一次核酸。进入社区的人必须出示居住证明。官员通过手机监视着人们的行动。
"The mobilization of so many hyperlocal officials one state media report estimated that one had been deployed for every 250 adults represents ""possibly the largest expansion of Chinese state capacity in the past 40 years,"" said Taisu Zhang, a law professor at Yale who studies China. ""It used to be, for most people you didn't really feel the state in your daily life too much. Now, of course, the state is everywhere.""","动员如此众多的底层官员——有官媒报道称每人要负责管理约250名成年人——说明了""可能是过去40年来中国政府能力的最大扩张，""研究中国问题的耶鲁大学法学教授张泰苏表示。""以前大多数人在日常生活中是感受不到多少国家的影响的。现在的情况就变成，国家无处不在。"""
"Officials even entered apartments in Xiasha, checking closets and under beds for people with Covid who might have been trying to avoid detection.",官员们甚至进入下沙的公寓，检查衣柜和床下，寻找可能试图逃避检测的新冠病毒感染者。
"Mr. Wu, who opened his business 20 years ago, said he had done his best to cooperate with the Covid measures. He took daily tests. He got vaccinated. Yet there he was, sitting in a mostly dark alley, reeling off the neighboring shops a photography studio, another massage parlor that had gone out of business. Only one customer had come by that evening, to ask about prices (about $21 for a standard massage), but ultimately walked away.",20年前开始做生意的吴群林说，他已经尽了最大努力配合新冠措施。他每天都测核酸。他打了疫苗。然而，到头来他坐在几乎一片漆黑的巷子里，打量着附近那些已经关门的店铺——一家照相馆，另一家按摩院。当晚只有一位顾客来询问价格(标准按摩约150元)，但最终还是离开了。
"""You've managed us before, that's the function of the state,"" Mr. Wu said. But, ""it's like if your parents tried to control you too much you'd feel uncomfortable. And if you didn't do anything about it, you'd also feel uncomfortable, right?""","""你过去管我们，也是国家的职能，""吴群林说。但是，""好像你爹妈管你管得实在太狠了，你肯定也会不舒服。所以说你不反抗，你也肯定不舒服，就这样对不对?"""
'Unless Necessary',"""非必要"""
"The question facing ""zero Covid"" is this: Now that people are expressing their dissatisfaction, what comes next?","""清零""面临的问题是:现在人们都在表达不满，那接下来又会怎样?"
"The protests that erupted over the past week were rooted in the stringent coronavirus policies, but some protesters expanded their demands to more directly confront the party's reassertion of power. In Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere, they chanted for democracy, freedom of speech, an end to the authoritarianism that had enabled ""zero Covid"" in the first place.","过去一周爆发的抗议活动源于严厉的新冠政策，但一些抗议者扩大了要求，更直接地对抗党对权力的重申。在北京、上海和其他地方，他们高呼民主、言论自由，呼吁结束让""清零""成为可能的威权主义。"
"But the security apparatus has grown only stronger from the past three years of controls. It is also not clear how many of the protesters share the demands, or the aspiration, for more political freedom; the angry workers in Guangzhou were focused on the basic right to work and move freely. If China manages to limit the impact of future outbreaks as it loosens restrictions, the sense of shared grievance could sputter.",但是，经过过去三年的控制，安全机构变得更加强大。目前还不清楚有多少抗议者有同样的要求或渴望更多政治自由;愤怒的广州工人关注的是工作和自由行动的基本权利。如果中国在放松限制的同时成功限制了未来疫情的影响，共同的不满可能会消散。
"Still, even if ""zero Covid"" goes away, Mr. Xi's broader fixation on control is unlikely to do the same. In that environment, it remains to be seen whether the ambition that fueled China's rise can still thrive.","不过，即使""清零""政策取消了，习近平对控制的更大执着也不可能随之消失。在这种环境下，推动中国崛起的雄心壮志是否还能蓬勃发展，还有待观察。"
"That ambition drove Li Hong, 36, to take over a clothing factory last year in Haizhu. Since arriving from Hubei 16 years ago, Ms. Li had worked her way from the factory floor to management, and she was hungry to keep advancing and betting on herself. She knew the economy was shaky, but with so many factories going under, she could get one at a good price.",这种雄心驱使36岁的李红(音)去年收购了海珠的一家服装厂。自从16年前从湖北来到这里，李红一直从工厂的底层工作到管理层，她渴望不断进步，不断投资自己。她知道经济不稳定，但随着许多工厂倒闭，她可以廉价买下一家工厂。
"""Opportunities come to those who are prepared, but even if there aren't opportunities, we want to go find them,"" she said this summer in her small back office, where she kept a couch for naps during long shifts.","""机会都是给有做准备的人，但是我们就是说没有机会也想去找这个机会，""今年夏天，她在自己的小办公室里说。她在办公室里放了一张沙发，方便加班时打盹。"
But this spring's lockdown in Shanghai cut off orders from a major client there. Then came the Guangzhou outbreak. Factories in Haizhu were ordered to close. Ms. Li tested positive and was sent to a makeshift hospital.,但今年春天，因为上海封城，切断了当地一家大客户的订单。接着，广州暴发疫情。海珠区的工厂被勒令关闭。李红自己检测呈阳性，被送往方舱。
"After being released two weeks later, she returned to Hubei because her home in Guangzhou was sealed off, she said by phone. Her factory lease expires in January; she did not know if she would renew.",她在电话里说，两周后她离开方舱，回到了湖北老家，因为在广州的家被封了。她的工厂租约将于明年1月到期;她不知道自己是否会续约。
"She had always considered herself a go getter, especially in a world where female factory bosses are rare. But she knew that individual drive went only so far. Even after Guangzhou eased restrictions after the protests, she worried that local officials were merely trying to avoid more bad publicity, not listening to people's demands.",她一直自认为是个能干人，尤其是在一个罕有女性当工厂老板的世界里。但她知道，光是自己有冲劲是不够的。即使广州在抗议活动后放宽了限制，她还是担心当地官员只是想避开更多的负面宣传，而不是倾听民众的需求。
"""They won't make decisions based on what you want,"" Ms. Li said. Ultimately, she was resigned: ""They set the policies the way they want, and I'll do whatever other people do.""","""他不会按你的要求去执行那些，""李红说。最终她选择听天由命，""他们政策怎么下，别人怎么做，我就怎么做。"""
"The reining in of expectations is perhaps best encapsulatedby a phrase ubiquitous in China's Covid restrictions: ""Unless necessary."" Officials have instructed citizens: Do not gather ""unless necessary,"" do not leave home ""unless necessary."" Many Chinese who had learned to dream of progress even luxury suddenly have been told, again, to expect only the essentials.",在中国的新冠限制措施中，一句无处不在的话或许可以最好地概括对期望值的约束——非必要。官员告诉民众:非必要不聚集、非必要不出门。许多曾经梦想着进步——甚至是奢华——的中国人突然又被告知，只许期待最基本的东西。
"Still, some hold on to hope that the retreat is a blip. For all the present difficulties, the years of extraordinary growth are still fresh in many minds.",尽管如此，一些人仍然希望这种倒退只是暂时的。尽管目前存在种种困难，但在许多人的脑海中，当年的非凡增长岁月仍然记忆犹新。
"Atop a hill in Shenzhen's Lianhuashan Park stands a 20-foot bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping. Mr. Deng, the leader who pioneered China's embrace of market forces after Mao's death, watches over the city that is a living reminder of the country's ability to change direction. Mr. Deng is shown in midstride, to honor his credo that opening should only accelerate.",在深圳莲花山公园的小山顶上，伫立着六米高的邓小平铜像。毛泽东去世后，邓小平是率先拥抱市场经济的中国领导人，他的目光注视着这座城市，以生动的方式提醒着人们，这个国家是有能力改变方向的。邓小平的塑像迈着稳健的步伐，彰显他开放只会加速的信条。
"Chen Chengzhi, 80, a retired government cadre who hikes to that statue every day for exercise, credits Mr. Deng with changing his life. Mr. Chen moved to Shenzhen in the 1980s, soon after Mr. Deng allowed economic experimentation here. The city then had just a few hundred thousand people, but Mr. Chen, who had endured famine and the Cultural Revolution, believed in Mr. Deng's vision.",80岁的政府退休干部陈承志(音)每天都要来到这里锻炼，他认为是邓小平改变了自己的生活。上世纪80年代，在邓小平允许深圳进行经济试验后不久，陈承志就搬到了深圳。当时这座城市只有几十万人口，但经历过饥荒和文化大革命的陈承志相信邓小平的愿景。
"""At the end of the day, all good things in China are related to Shenzhen,"" Mr. Chen said on one of his daily walks, adding that he cheered when China's premier, Li Keqiang, visited the statue in August and pledged that China would continue opening to the world.","""有什么好事都跟深圳有关，""陈承志在每天例行的散步时说道。他还说，当中国总理李克强8月参观这座雕像并承诺中国将继续向世界开放时，他感到欢欣鼓舞。"
"If it doesn't do so, Mr. Chen said, ""China will hit a dead end.""","如果不这样做，陈承志说，""中国就是死路一条。"""
"But Mr. Li is retiring, even as the Xi Jinping era of rising state control stretches on.",但李克强即将退休，而国家控制不断增强的习近平时代仍在继续。
"For now, Mr. Chen continues climbing the hill looking over the city that he helped build, that he believes in still.",现在，陈承志每天还是会继续攀爬这座小山——俯瞰着他参与建设的城市，他仍然相信这座城市。
"For decades, China's business class had an unspoken contract with the Communist Party: Let us make money and we'll turn a blind eye to how you use your power.",几十年来，中国的工商阶层与中共曾有过一个心照不宣的约定:你让我们赚钱，我们就对你如何使用权力睁一只眼闭一只眼。
"Like most Chinese people, they bought into the party's argument that its one-party rule provides more efficient governance.",他们和大多数中国人一样信从了中共的说法，那就是中共的一党专政让治理更有效。
"Now, the tacit agreement that entrepreneurs had come to count on is dissolving in front of their eyes. China's leader, Xi Jinping, used an important Communist Party congress last month to establish near-absolute power and make it clear that security would trump the economy as the nation's priority.",现在，企业家们曾依赖的这个默契正在他们的眼前化为泡影。中国领导人习近平在中共上个月召开的重要会议上获得了近乎绝对的权力，他已明确表示，国家安全是置于经济之上的首要事项。
"""My last lingering hope was dashed,"" said the founder of an asset management firm in the southern city of Shenzhen who contacted me hours after the congress ended.","""今天把我仅存的一点小小的希望熄灭掉了，""南方城市深圳一家资产管理公司的创始人在二十大结束几个小时后联系我说。"
"""Totally finished, completely lost control and absolutely terrifying,"" a tech entrepreneur in Beijing texted me after seeing the party's new leadership lineup, which is packed with Mr. Xi's acolytes.","""彻底完蛋，完全失控，恐怖至极，""在看到中共新领导班子全是习近平的亲信后，北京的一位科技企业家给我发短信说。"
"Like many Chinese, they fully expected Mr. Xi to secure a third term, breaking a norm followed since the 1980s. Still, they held onto the hope that his dominance would be tempered by other power factions within the party. Mr. Xi's sweeping victory, by pushing out perceived moderates in favor of loyalists, made it clear that it would be a one-man rule system that could last for decades.",他们与许多中国人一样，完全预料到习近平能获得第三个任期，虽然这打破了20世纪80年代以来的惯例，但他们对习近平的统治地位会受到党内其他权力派系的约束仍抱有希望。习近平在二十大上把领导层中被外界视为温和派的人全部换成了自己的亲信，他的全面胜利已清楚地表明，其独揽大权的局面可能会持续几十年。
"China's last leader as powerful as Mr. Xi, 69, was Mao Zedong, who led the country into the Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution that resulted in tens of millions of deaths, social chaos and economic destruction.",习近平现年69岁，中国上一个权力如此之大的领导人是毛泽东，他领导下的中国发生了大饥荒和文化大革命，导致数千万人死亡、社会混乱和经济崩溃。
"Last month's party congress jolted the Chinese business world with uncertainty. It was seen publicly in the immediate market response: China's stocks plunged and its currency, the yuan, fell in value. I am hearing it in the voices and messages of the many businesspeople I have spoken to in recent weeks who repeatedly call their reaction a ""political depression.""","上个月召开的二十大给中国商界带来了不确定性。从市场的直接反应就能直接看出这一点:中国股市暴跌，人民币贬值。从最近几周与我交流的许多商界人士的言论和短信中，我感受到了这种不确定性，他们反复用""政治抑郁""一词来描述他们对二十大的反应。"
"They are not displaying their anxiety in public, unlike a young demonstrator I wrote about in my last column. All the businesspeople I interviewed for this article requested anonymity for fear of punishment by the authorities. But they are expressing dissent in their own way, pledging to withhold further investment in China or even contemplating leaving their country for another that would exchange a passport for their wealth.",他们不像我上一篇文章里写过的那些年轻抗议者，公开展示自己的焦虑。由于担心受到当局惩罚，我为本文采访的所有商界人士都要求不具名。但他们正在以自己的方式表达不同意见，发誓不再在中国进行更多投资，甚至考虑去其他国家，比如那些可以用钱买到护照的国家。
"The party, under Mr. Xi, has taken control of nearly every aspect of society, costing Chinese people agency over their destinies. Members of the business class, especially those working at the top of the technology sector who operated with relatively few restrictions until a few years ago, have taken it especially hard.",在习近平的领导下，中共已经几乎控制了社会的所有方面，使中国人失去了掌握自身命运的主动权。工商阶层的人士，尤其是那些直到几年前仍受到相对较少的限制、在科技领域高层工作的人，更难接受这种现实。
"These tech entrepreneurs mostly grew up ""in the age of 'economism,' when money making, economic principles and economic rationality trumped everything else,"" said Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. ""Now they see the regime puts politics in command,"" he said. ""For them, this is incomprehensible.""","这些科技领域的企业家大多是""在'经济主义'时代成长起来的，那时候，赚钱、经济原则和经济理性胜过一切""，加州克莱蒙特麦肯纳学院政府学教授裴敏欣说。""现在他们看到这个政权把政治放在首位。对他们来说，这不可理解。"""
"In the past decade, Mr. Xi's economic thinking can be summed up like this: bigger roles for the state, and smaller roles for the market. He left the private sector largely alone in his first term, when he was busy consolidating his power within the party and the military. In his second term, which began in 2017, Mr. Xi kept private enterprises on a much tighter leash. The government cracked down on businesses, sending some of the country's most successful business people into early retirement or self-imposed exile. China's harsh ""zero-Covid"" policy has left the economy in the worst shape in decades.","习近平过去十年的经济思路可以概括为:大政府小市场。在习近平的第一个任期里，他基本上没对民营部门下手，当时他正忙于巩固自己在党内和军队中的权力。在2017年开始的第二个任期里，习近平对民营企业进行了更严格的管理。政府严厉打击民营企业，导致中国一些最成功的商人提前退休或自我流放。中国严厉的""新冠清零""政策已使经济处于几十年来最糟糕的状态。"
"To Chinese in the business elite, who grew accustomed to the privilege and attention their success brought, the Big Boss, as many of them refer to Mr. Xi, doesn't care about the economy or people like them. In his opening address at the party congress, Mr. Xi mentioned ""security"" 52 times, ""Marxism"" 15 times and ""markets"" three times.","对于已经习惯了成功所带来的特权和关注的中国工商界精英们来说，大老板(这是他们中的许多人对习近平的称呼)并不关心经济或像他们这样的人。习近平在二十大开幕式上作报告时，52次提到""安全""，15次提到""马克思主义""，只提了三次""市场""。"
"""There's no question about the shift both in political rhetoric and in action and in also the appointment of the team,"" said Professor Pei, who said he believes that Mr. Xi's leadership lineup shows that he does not value expertise in managing a market-oriented economy. ""He values people who can implement his policy regardless of the economic consequences.""","""无论是政治言论还是行动，以及领导班子的组成，都毫无疑问地发生了变化，""裴敏欣表示。他说，他认为习近平挑选出来的领导阵容表明，他并不重视管理市场导向型经济的专业知识。""他看重那些能够执行他的政策而不考虑经济后果的人。"""
"That makes the business community anxious. Under Mr. Xi, the ability of China's bureaucracy to dictate to the public has increased while its ability to govern has decreased, Guoguang Wu, an adviser to former Premier Zhao Ziyang in the 1980s, told me on my Chinese language podcast.",这让工商界感到焦虑。曾在20世纪80年代担任赵紫阳总理顾问的吴国光在我的中文播客中告诉我，虽然中国官僚机构在习近平领导下增强了对公众发号施令的能力，但治理能力却在下降。
"""When the ability to govern decreases, even in the absence of any particular policy from the top, the ineptitude, brutality, and ignorance of lower-level officials will brew disasters for the common people they rule over,"" said Mr. Wu, who is a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions.","""治理能力削弱后，不用上边有什么很恶的政策，下边官员的无能、蛮横、无知，就会酿造各种直接关系到他们治下的老百姓的灾难，""吴国光说，他现在是斯坦福大学中国经济与制度研究中心的高级研究学者。"
"Many businesspeople have lost a lot of money under ""zero-Covid,"" which has shuttered cities and locked millions of people in their homes for weeks at a time as the government seeks to eliminate the coronavirus.","许多商人受""新冠清零""政策影响损失惨重，政府追求的消灭新冠病毒的目标已导致许多城市封城，数百万人被锁在家中，有时长达好几周。"
"""Under the leadership of this dictator, our great country is falling into an abyss,"" said a hardware tech executive in Shenzhen. ""But you can't do anything about it. It pains and depresses me.""","""在这个独裁者的带领下，这个国家在走向深渊。""深圳一名硬件技术领域的高管说。""你看着它下坠，那种无力感让我痛心、抑郁。"""
"Despite many conversations over the years, we never talked about politics. I was surprised when he called after the party congress to talk about his ""political depression."" He said he used to be very nationalistic, believing that the Chinese were among the smartest and the most hardworking people in the world. Now, he and many of his friends spend most of their time hiking, golfing and drinking. ""We're too depressed to work,"" he said.","尽管多年来我与这些商界人士进行过多次交流，但我们以前从不谈政治。上述高管在二十大结束后给我打电话时说，他有""政治抑郁""，让我感到很惊讶。他说他曾经非常民族主义，认为中国人民是世界上最聪明、最勤奋的人之一。现在，他和他的许多朋友们把大部分时间花在徒步、打高尔夫球和喝酒上。""我们都抑郁了，无法工作，""他说。"
"Until a year ago, his start-up was doing so well that he was planning to take it public. Then he lost a big chunk of his revenues and his new hires sat idly with nothing to do when cities were locked down under the ""zero-Covid"" rules. He said now he has no choice but to lay off more than 100 people, sell his business and move his family to North America.","他的初创公司直到一年前一直表现非凡，以至于他曾有过让公司上市的打算。后来，""新冠清零""政策导致城市被封后，他新雇来的员工们整天闲着，无事可干，他亏了一大笔钱。他说，现在他别无选择，只能裁掉100多人，卖掉自己的生意，举家迁往北美。"
"""Since the dark night has descended,"" he said, ""I'll deal with it the dark night way.""","""既然黑夜已经来临，就按黑夜的方法去处理好了，""他说。"
"The tech entrepreneur from Beijing who texted me after the party congress recounted a chilling experience. In May, when there were rumors that Beijing could be locked down, he felt he could not tell his employees to leave work early and stock up on groceries. He was worried that he could be reported for spreading rumors something that had gotten people detained by the police. He told them only that they should feel free to leave early if they had things to take care of.",二十大后给我发短信的那名北京科技企业家向我讲述了一段令人不寒而栗的经历。今年5月有传言说北京可能要封城时，他觉得他不能叫员工们提前下班去囤货。他担心那样做会被举报散布谣言(有些人曾因这种举报被警方拘留)。他只是告诉员工们，如果他们有事情要处理，有早点下班的自由。
This successful business person is now applying to emigrate to a European country and the United States.,这名成功的商人现在正在申请移民欧洲国家和美国。
"Just like many ordinary Chinese people, the executives I spoke to said they were horrified by the video of Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi's predecessor as China's top leader, being abruptly led out of the closing ceremony of the party congress. They did not accept the official government explanation that Mr. Hu had to leave early because of health issues",和许多普通中国人一样，与我交流的高管们说，他们看到胡锦涛突然被带出二十大会场的视频深感震惊。胡锦涛是中国最高领导人习近平的前任。这些商人不接受政府对此事的解释，官方的说法是胡锦涛因健康问题不得不提前退场。
"If Mr. Xi could remove his predecessor like that, several of them said, he could do anything to anyone.",这些商人中有不少人说，如果习近平能这样对待自己的前任，他可以对任何人下手。
"A well-connected investor in Beijing said that his friends who are entrepreneurs now realized they could no longer remain indifferent to politics. At social gatherings, they have started discussing which countries to seek passports from, and how to move their assets offshore. At social gatherings, hosts are asking friends to surrender their phones to be kept in a separate place for fear of surveillance.",北京的一名人脉广泛的投资者说，他的企业家朋友们现在意识到，不能再对政治漠不关心。他们在社交聚会时开始讨论申请哪些国家的护照，以及如何将资产转移到海外等问题。这些社交聚会的主人现在要求朋友们交出手机，放置在其他地方，以免受到监控。
"After the party congress, most people in the investor's circle expect that they will be forced to pay more in taxes or be expected to donate more money to universities and other state-backed charities. They are not planning to make any big investments.",二十大结束后，投资者圈子中的大多数人预计他们将被迫缴纳更多的税，或被迫向大学和其他国家支持的慈善机构捐款。他们都没有进行任何大投资的计划。
"""We're all anxious,"" he said. ""We're at a loss of what to do at this historical crossroad.""","""大家都很焦虑，""他说。""我们站在历史的十字路口，不知道该怎么办。"""
"A protester unfurled two banners on a highway overpass in central Beijing on Oct. 13, denouncing Xi Jinping as a ""despotic traitor."" China's censors went to great lengths to scrub the internet of any reference to the act of dissent, prohibiting all discussion and shutting down many offending social media accounts.","10月13日，一名抗议者在北京市中心的一座立交桥上打出了两条横幅，谴责习近平是""独裁国贼""。中国的审查人员竭尽全力删掉了网上提及该抗议行为的内容，禁止所有相关讨论，还封了许多违规者的社交媒体帐号。"
"The slogans didn't go away. Instead, they caught on inside and outside China, online and offline.",但抗议标语并没有因此而消失。它们反而在中国境内境外，以及线上线下传播开来。
"Encouraged by the Beijing protester's extremely rare display of courage, young Chinese are using creative ways to spread the banners' anti-Xi messages. They graffitied the slogans in public toilets in China. They used Apple's AirDrop feature to send photos of the messages to fellow passengers' iPhones in subway cars. They posted the slogans on university campuses all over the world. They organized chat groups to bond and shouted ""Remove Xi Jinping"" in front of Chinese embassies. This all happened while the Communist Party was convening an all-important congress in Beijing and putting forth an image of a country singularly united behind a great leader.","中国的年轻人受到了北京这名抗议者极为罕见的勇敢表现所鼓舞，正在用充满创意的方式传播横幅上的反习信息。他们把抗议标语涂鸦在公共厕所里;用苹果产品的隔空投送功能，把抗议标语的图片发给地铁车厢里其他乘客的iPhone上;在世界各地的大学校园张贴标语海报;组织聊天群加强联系，在中国大使馆前高喊""罢免习近平""。这一切都发生在中国共产党在北京召开一次非常重要的全国代表大会、展现在伟大领袖领导下紧密团结的国家形象之际。"
"The aftermath of the Beijing protest ""made me feel, for the first time, hopeful,"" said an organizer of an Instagram account known as Citizens Daily CN, which posts photo submissions of sightings of anti-Xi messages. ""In this era of oppressive silence, there's anger in silence, hope in despair.""","北京抗议活动的出现""让我最明显的感觉不是艰难，而是有希望""，参与管理Instagram""公民日报""帐号的人说。这个帐号专门发布人们看到的反习信息的照片。""这么'万马齐喑'的时代，其实静默中也有愤怒，绝望中也有希望。"""
"Young people like him are emerging as unexpected rebels against Mr. Xi, who over the weekend became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong by securing a norm-breaking third term and stuffing the party's leadership with loyalists.",像他这样的年轻人正在出人意料地成为反习叛逆者。习近平是中国自毛泽东以来权力最大的领导人，上周末，他获得了打破常规的第三个任期，而且把中共领导层全部变成了自己的亲信。
"While there has always been political dissent in China, the country's Generation Zers are known for toeing the government line, both because they grew up in China's most prosperous period and because the party is very good at using the internet and social media for indoctrination.",尽管中国一直存在政治异见，但中国的Z世代以听政府的话而闻名，这是因为他们成长于中国最繁荣的时期，也是因为中共非常善于利用互联网和社交媒体进行思想灌输。
"Now, though, some of them are experiencing a quiet political awakening, having grown unhappy about the government's comprehensive censorship, the harsh ""zero Covid"" policy and the ever-tightening grip on society.","但现在，由于对政府的全面审查、严厉的""新冠清零""政策，以及对社会不断收紧的控制感到不满，他们中的一些人正在悄悄经历一场政治觉醒。"
"The vast majority of the young dissenters are having their first brush with political rebellion, which is prohibited in China and closely monitored by the authorities, even as a Chinese person living abroad. In doing so, they're overcoming their fear of the repressive government, their political depression and their loneliness as political heretics in a society that espouses one leader, one party and one ideology.",对绝大多数年轻异见者来说，这是他们第一次触及政治反抗，这种反抗在中国是被禁止的，而且受到当局的严密监控，哪怕你是居住在海外的中国人。在这样做的过程中，他们正在克服对专制政府的恐惧和政治上的压抑感，以及在只拥护一名领导人、一个政党和一种意识形态的社会里，作为政治异端的孤独感。
"As beginner protesters, they're timid, scared and inexperienced. They are ashamed that they have to ask for anonymity in media interviews and even hide their identities from each other. (All the people interviewed for this column requested anonymity for fear of punishment by the Chinese authorities.) The risks are too high. But being part of the global anti-Xi protest movement empowers them.",他们是抗议新手，胆小、害怕，也缺乏经验。他们对于在接受采访时提出不具名的要求感到羞愧，他们甚至对彼此隐瞒身份。(因为害怕中国政府，本文所有受访者都要求不具名)反抗的风险太高。但成为全球反习抗议运动的一员又让他们有一种获得力量的感觉。
"By sharing the protest posters online, many people realized that they were not alone in their political thinking. ""It comforts people and gives them hope,"" said the administrator of the Instagram account @northern_square, an art student in the United States. The account has received more than 2,000 submissions from all over the world of sightings of anti-Xi messages. Citizens Daily CN said that by Sunday it had received more than 1,500 submissions of anti-Xi slogan sightings from more than 328 universities around the world.","通过在网上分享抗议海报，许多人意识到，他们并不是唯一有这种政治想法的人。""它会给人宽慰和希望，""上述Instagram帐号的管理员、在美国学习艺术专业的""北方广场""说道。该帐号已收到人们在世界各地看到的2000多个反习信息的图片。公民日报称，截至周日，已收到来自全球328多所大学的1500多份反习标语目击报告。"
"In a sign of the risks these people are taking, Citizens Daily CN's organizers and volunteers, mostly living outside China, remain anonymous even to each other.",公民日报的组织者和志愿者大多居住在中国境外，他们甚至不知道彼此的真实姓名，由此可见这些人所承担的风险。
"The Beijing protester is now viewed as a hero and an inspiration among many Chinese. He was last seen being detained by the police on the Sitong Bridge overpass. His identity still unverified, he's being called the ""Bridge Man,"" a reference to the ""Tank Man,"" who stood in front of tanks during the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in 1989.","北京的那名抗议者现已被许多中国人视为英雄和鼓舞人心的人。人们最后一次看到他是在四通桥上被警方带走的情景。他的身份仍未得到证实，他被称为""四通桥人""(Bridge Man)，这一称呼仿照了""坦克人""，后者指的是1989年北京血腥镇压民主示威者时，站出来挡住坦克前行的那个人。"
"His banners contained a list of accusations against Mr. Xi's rule over the past decade, during which the autocratic leader severely restricted freedom of speech, walked back economic reforms and subjected 1.4 billion Chinese to mandatory participation in the zero-Covid policy, which has thrown the country into social, economic and political chaos.",他挂出来的横幅对习近平过去十年的统治进行了一系列声讨，这名专制领导人在其统治期间严格限制言论自由，放弃经济改革，还强迫14亿中国人接受新冠清零政策，该政策让国家陷入了社会、经济和政治混乱。
"Mr. Xi has all but silenced nearly everyone inside the country who has ever spoken up to him, from activists to business leaders to academics, sentencing some of them to long jail terms. His propaganda machine has been in high gear, brainwashing China's young generation. People who thought independently either learned to shut up or were forced to emigrate.",习近平还让国内几乎所有曾敢于发表反对意见的人噤声，他们包括活动人士、商界领袖和学者，其中一些人被判以长期监禁。习近平的宣传机器一直在高速运转，对中国的年轻一代进行洗脑。独立思考者要么学乖了、不再发声，要么被迫移民。
"A university student in Guangzhou told me that he was stunned by the courage of the ""Bridge Man."" He wants more Chinese to learn about what the man has done. Several times in the past week, he boarded subways and used his iPhone's AirDrop function to share photos about the protest and instructions on how to download virtual private network software to bypass China's censorship.","广州的一名大学生告诉我，""四通桥人""的勇气使他震惊。他想让更多的中国人知道这个人干了什么。过去一周，他多次在地铁使用iPhone的隔空投送功能，分享四通桥抗议照片，还分享教人如何下载虚拟专用网络软件，以绕过审查制度的指南。"
"""The first step to end the Communist Party rule is to wake up the people,"" he said. He believes that accessing uncensored information can help break the spell of indoctrination.","他说，""结束共产党的统治第一步是让这些人觉醒。""他认为，能看到未经审查的信息有助于打破思想灌输的紧箍咒。"
"This semester he has to spend three afternoons a week in ideology classes, including one that teaches students how to think about current affairs, such as U.S.-China relations and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With the censorship and brainwashing, it's very hard to wake people up, he said.",这个学期，他每周要花三个下午上思想教育课程，包括教学生如何思考时事(比如美中关系和俄罗斯入侵乌克兰)的课程。他说，由于审查和洗脑，唤醒人们很困难。
"He was scared when he boarded the subway, he said. He wore a mask, as required by the Guangzhou metro's Covid policies, and found a place where he could use his jacket to keep his phone screen from being seen by surveillance cameras or other passengers. He said more than 20 people had accepted his photos via AirDrop. But he also got an unexpected response from a fellow passenger who sent a photo with the sentence, ""China doesn't need smart cookies.""","他说，刚在地铁上做这些事情的时候很害怕。他按照广州的地铁防疫政策要求戴上了口罩，找到一个能用夹克将手机屏幕挡住、不让监控摄像头或其他乘客看到的地方。他说，已有20多人通过隔空投送接受了他发的图片，但也收到了一份意外回复，有人发给他一张写着""中国不需要聪明人""的照片。"
"""The passenger was mocking me that what I was doing was futile,"" he said.","""TA在笑我，这样做是无意义的，""他说。"
"For Kathy, a Chinese student in London, political apathy like this is what upsets her the most. Out of her 30-plus undergraduate classmates back in Beijing, she could talk about politics to only one of them. The others either showed no interest or disapproved of her critical views of the government.",对在伦敦读书的中国学生凯西来说，这种政治冷漠是最让她不快的东西。她只能和她在北京读大学时的30多个同学中的少数人谈论政治。其他同学要么没兴趣，要么不赞成她对政府的批评意见。
"""They are usually normal people, even kind,"" she said. Then they would become nationalistic ""robots"" when something like Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan visit happened, she said. ""As if a program embedded in the robots was turned on, everyone started posting the same horrible language on social media,"" she said.","""他们其实很多时候是一个正常人，甚至是好人，""她说。但每当有美国众议院议长佩洛西访台之类的事情发生时，他们会变成民族主义""机器人""，她说。""他们就像是机器人体内程序的设定突然发作了，然后发一些你觉得非常恐怖的话，""她说。"
"When she saw photos of the protest in Beijing, she was awed by the ""Bridge Man's"" courage, too. Then she started seeing people posting sightings of anti-Xi slogans in many parts of the world.","看到四通桥的抗议照片时，她也被""四通桥人""的勇气所震撼。然后她开始看到人们上传到网上的在世界各地看到反习口号的图片。"
"She started to cry and couldn't stop for hours, she said.",她忍不住哭了起来，哭了几个小时，她说。
"As the photos of the protest posters kept coming in, she felt she saw a little light in the darkness. She's not alone anymore.",随着抗议海报图片不断上传，她觉得在黑暗中看到了一丝曙光。她不再孤单。
"""I thought to myself that there are many Chinese who also want freedom and democracy,"" she said. ""But where are you? Where can I find you? If we meet on the street, how can we recognize each other?""","""我就想有很多想要自由，想要民主的中国人，""她说。 ""但是你们到底在哪里?我到底该怎么找到你呢?我们走在街上又怎么能够认出彼此? """
"At about 4 the next morning, she went downstairs from her dorm room to print some posters. She was nervous about running into other Chinese students, most of whom she would describe as ""little pinks,"" or pro-Beijing youths. She wore a mask to avoid cameras, even though she had seldom worn one since arriving in London a few weeks ago.","第二天早上4点左右，她从寝室下楼去打印了一些海报。她担心遇到其他中国学生，她说大多数中国学生都是""小粉红""。为了避开摄像头，她带上了口罩，尽管自她几周前抵达伦敦以来，很少戴口罩。"
"She was even more nervous putting up the posters on campus. Every time she saw an East Asian face, she would run to hide in a corridor or a restroom. She was afraid they could report her to the embassy or post photos of her on social media. Her parents are still in China, so she needs to take their safety into account.",她在校园里张贴海报时更加紧张。每次看到东亚面孔，她都会跑到走廊或洗手间躲起来。她担心他们会向大使馆举报她或在社交媒体上发布她的照片。她的父母还在中国，所以她需要考虑到他们的安全。
"After putting up the posters all over her campus, she felt much more at peace with herself.",将海报贴满校园后，她的内心平静了许多。
"A week later, when a new chat group titled ""'My Duty' Democracy Wall in London"" was set up on the messaging app Telegram, Kathy was one of the first to join. Within a day, more than 200 Chinese had also signed up. By Sunday, four days later, there were more than 400 members. Most introduced themselves as students and professionals in the U.K. Many said they had joined to find like-minded people because they, like Kathy, didn't know whom to trust and felt lonely and powerless.","一周后，当消息应用程序Telegram上建立了一个名为""'我的义务'伦敦民主墙""的新聊天群时，凯西是第一批加入的人之一。还有200多名中国人在一天之内报名加入。到了四天后的星期日已超过400人。大多数人介绍自己是英国的学生和专业人士。许多人说，他们加入是为了寻找志同道合的人，因为他们和凯西一样，不知道该信任谁，感到孤独和无能为力。"
"Citizens Daily CN, the Instagram account, organized Telegram chat groups in London, New York, Toronto and two other places to provide a safe online space for overseas Chinese to exchange views. Most people use online handles that disguise their identity.","Instagram帐号""公民日报""组织了在伦敦、纽约、多伦多和另外两个地方的Telegram聊天群，为海外华人提供安全的网上交流空间。大多数人使用隐藏身份的网名。"
"They have discussed the depths of their frustration with political apathy and the best way to deal with pro-Beijing youth. Quite a few admitted that they were once nationalistic themselves, but added that China's harsh zero-Covid policy had made them realize the importance of having a government accountable to its people. More important, they discussed what further actions they could take.",他们讨论对政治冷漠的挫败感，以及与小粉红打交道的最佳方式。不少人承认，他们自己也曾是民族主义者，但补充说，中国严厉的清零政策使他们意识到，拥有一个对人民负责的政府的重要性。更重要的是，他们讨论了可以采取的进一步行动。
"On Sunday, Kathy, who is in her early 20s, joined a demonstration for the first time in her life. For safety, she wore a mask and sunglasses, even though it was dark when the protest reached the Chinese Embassy in London. A young Chinese woman started chanting slogans made popular by the Bridge Man: ""Students, workers, let's strike. Depose the despotic traitor Xi Jinping.""","周日，20岁出头的凯西有生以来第一次参加了示威活动。为了安全起见，她戴着口罩和太阳镜，尽管抗议活动到达中国驻伦敦大使馆时天已经黑了。一位年轻的中国女性开始高呼因四通桥上的""四通桥人""而流传开来的口号:""罢课，罢工，罢免独裁国贼习近平。"""
"Kathy and a few other Chinese students repeated after her. Just uttering those words gave her goose bumps. She shivered and cried. ""Fear never felt so strong and so real in my life,"" she said. Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators cheered them on.","凯西和其他几个中国学生跟着她重复。光是说出这几个字就让她起鸡皮疙瘩。她颤抖着哭了起来。""这也是我第一次感受到最真实最强烈的恐惧，""她说。有香港的民主示威者为他们加油。"
"""It was unbelievable that I shouted those words,"" Kathy said. ""I learned that courage needs practice, too. I won't be able to learn these things unless I practice them constantly.""","""第一次这么大声地喊出这些东西，难以置信，""凯西说。""勇气也是需要练习的。这些东西只有不断练习才能习得。"""
"Poised to take a groundbreaking third term in power, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has advanced a contingent of Communist Party loyalists ready to defend him, expand state influence over the economy and bolster national security.",中国领导人习近平即将迎来前所未有的第三任期，他已提拔了一群随时准备为他而战的效忠派共产党人，扩大了政府对经济的影响，加强了国家安全。
Mr. Xi opened the new phase of his authoritarian rule with a clutch of victories at the end of a party congress on Saturday. He hurried into retirement two top officials from a more moderate political mold. He positioned allies to dominate the new leadership. He kept officials who have promoted his muscular approach in diplomacy and the military. And Mr. Xi gave no hint of preparing for eventual retirement by anointing a likely successor.,在周六的党代会闭幕之际，习近平以一系列胜利成果开启了他威权统治的新阶段。他让两名政治理念较温和的最高层官员匆忙退休。他留下了那些在外交和军事上宣扬他强硬政策的官员。而且，习近平没有指定潜在的继任者，完全没有要为最终退休做准备的意思。
"""China has entered a new era of maximum Xi,"" saidNeil Thomas, an analyst of Chinese politics for the Eurasia Group. The outcome, Mr. Thomas added, ""means more support for Xi's policies, which means a stronger focus on political control, economic statism, and assertive diplomacy.""","""中国已经进入了一个习近平最大化的新时代，""欧亚集团的中国政治分析员尼尔·托马斯说。托马斯还表示，这样的结果""表明对习近平政策的更多支持，这意味着更加注重政治控制、经济国家主义和强硬的外交""。"
"Since taking over as party leader in late 2012, Mr. Xi has transformed China, purging potential rivals, crushing dissent and reasserting the central role of the Communist Party in Chinese society. Mr. Xi's progress toward his new term has been hampered this year by China's painful economic slowdown, spreading public frustration over the country's strict Covid rules, and rumors of internal opposition.",自2012年底接任中共领导人以来，习近平改变了中国，清洗了潜在的竞争对手，粉碎了异议，并重申了共产党在中国社会中的核心作用。今年，由于中国经济不景气、公众对新冠防疫政策不满情绪的蔓延、以及党内反对的传言，习近平迈向新任期的进展曾受到阻碍。
"The congress, however, seemed to brush all that aside with regimented acclaim for Mr. Xi, urging the party's members to stay in lock step with him ""in thought, politics and action.""","然而，党代会似乎将这一切抛在一边，对习近平大唱赞歌，敦促党员""在思想上、政治上、行动上""与他保持一致。"
"Mr. Xi's keynotespeechat the opening of the congress last Sunday signaled that he would press on with fortifying China against a plethora of perceived dangers. That includes stepping up efforts to turn China into a leading technology power, reducing reliance on Western know-how. He also said that China would continue upgrading its already formidable national security apparatus.",上周日，习近平在二十大开幕式上的主题报告表明他将继续加强中国的力量，以应对众多已察觉到的危险。这包括加大努力将中国打造成一个先进技术大国，减少对西方技术的依赖。他还表示，中国将继续升级其本已强大的国家安全机构。
"Mr. Xi also bolstered his status when the congress approved amendments to the party charter its foundational rules to elevate his authority. A statement from the meeting said that Mr. Xi's leadership was essential to ""eradicating grave hazards were present inside the party, state and military,"" apparently referring to corruption and disloyalty.","习近平也巩固了自己的地位，因为二十大通过了党章修正案以提升他的权威。大会的一份报告表示，习近平的领导对于""消除党、国家、军队内部存在的严重隐患""至关重要，这些隐患显然指的是腐败和不忠。"
"He is likely to face even less potential pushback to his policies after the congress approved the new membership list for the Central Committee, the elite body from which China's top leaders are drawn.",在二十大批准了新一届中央委员会成员名单后，习近平施政所面临的阻力可能会进一步减少，该委员会是选举中国最高领导人的最高权力机关。
"Several senior figures stepped down, all but ensuring that more of Mr. Xi's favored officials will rise into the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's highest decision-making body. Mr. Xi's enhanced control suggests China will maintain its tough stance toward Washington, and expand the party's intervention in the economy, technology and the internet.",多位高级官员卸任，这几乎确保了更多习近平青睐的官员将升至政治局常务委员会，这是党的最高决策机构。习近平加强控制意味着中国将保持对美国强硬的立场，并扩大党对经济、技术和互联网的干预。
"""There's not a single sign of any fundamental revisions of policy,"" saidRichard McGregor, an expert on Chinese politics at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. ""It's all shoulders to the wheel.""","""没有任何根本性政策调整的迹象，""悉尼洛伊研究所的中国政治专家马利德说。""都是一条路走到底的调子。"""
"Mr. Xi's new term and his leadership team will not be officially confirmed until Sunday, when the new Central Committee meets and holds a carefully controlled vote. But the scale of Mr. Xi's victory was already clear from the Central Committee makeup, experts said.",习近平的新任期和他的领导团队要到周日才能正式确认，届时，新一届中央委员会将召开会议，并举行一次受到严格控制的投票。但专家表示，从中央委员会的构成来看，习近平的胜利已经很明确了。
"The party congress is usually a choreographed affair, but the unexpected departure of the former leader, Hu Jintao, caused a brief stir. Mr. Hu, 79, had been seated next to Mr. Xi in the front row on the stage when, possibly unwell, he was helped to his feet by an aide and escorted out of the cavernous hall, without explanation. As he was led off the stage, Mr. Hu appeared to speak to Mr. Xi and to pat Li Keqiang, the premier, on his shoulder.",党代会通常会按部就班进行，但前国家领导人胡锦涛的意外离场引发了一阵轰动。79岁的胡锦涛坐在台上第一排习近平的身旁，也许身体不适，他被一名助手扶起并护送出了宏大的会场，没有给出任何解释。被带下台时，胡锦涛似乎在对习近平说话，还拍了拍总理李克强的肩膀。
"Mr. Li and two other top officials who had risen under Mr. Hu Wang Yang and Han Zheng stepped down from the Central Committee, indicating that all three are set to retire. Mr. Li has served for the past decade as China's premier, the second most powerful post in China, but Mr. Xi has overshadowed Mr. Li for years.",李克强及汪洋和韩正这两位在胡锦涛任内崛起的高级官员退出了中央委员会，这表明此三人都将退休。在过去十年间，李克强一直担任中国总理，这是中国排在第二位的要职，但多年来，习近平的风头都盖过了李克强。
"""There's been a lot about the premier-as-savior talk that these officials could stay around and push back against Xi, but obviously that's not going to happen,"" saidChristopher K. Johnson, the president of the China Strategies Group and a former C.I.A. analyst of Chinese politics. ""Proximity to Xi is all that really matters now.""","""有很多关于总理力挽狂澜的说法——这些官员留下来可以与习近平对抗，但这显然不会发生，""中国战略集团总裁、前中情局中国政治分析师克里斯托弗·K·约翰逊说。""与习近平关系密切才是现在真正管用的。"""
"Hu Chunhua, currently a vice premier, still has a chance of entering the new Politburo Standing Committee, despite his lack of robust ties to Mr. Xi.",现任副总理胡春华仍有机会进入新一届政治局常委会，尽管他与习近平的关系并不紧密。
"""If Hu Chunhua is promoted, he will be expected to be a loyal Xi acolyte like everybody else,"" Mr. McGregor said. ""There are no alternative centers of power centers left in the Standing Committee, if there ever were, even symbolically.""","""如果胡春华被提拔，那他也会像其他人一样成为习近平的忠实追随者，""马利德说。""常委会就算曾经有过其他权力中心，现在也没有了，连象征性的都没了。"""
"Aside from Mr. Li, several others set to retire were senior leaders with a record of favoring market-oriented policies and a somewhat less confrontational stance toward the West. They included Wang Yang, a current Politburo Standing Committee member, as well as three top officials in finance: Liu He, Guo Shuqing and Yi Gang.",除李克强之外，其他几位即将退休的高层领导都曾支持市场导向的政策，对西方的立场也没有那么强的对抗性。这些人包括现任政治局常委汪洋，以及三名高级金融官员:刘鹤、郭树清和易纲。
"""The generation of financial technocrats with both professional training and deep connections with the global financial community is passing from the scene,"" said Victor Shih, a specialist in China's politics and finance at the University of California in San Diego. He said they were being ""replaced by career provincial bankers who have a track record of executing the party's policies.""","""受过专业培训、在全球金融界人脉深厚的一代金融技术官僚正在淡出，""加利福尼亚大学圣迭戈分校的中国政治和金融问题专家史宗瀚(Victor Shih)表示。他说，取代他们的是一些""在地方银行工作、向来坚持执行党的政策的职业官员""。"
"Cheng Li, a specialist in Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, had a similar take. ""Xi Jinping has further consolidated near-absolute power by promoting his proteges to the top leadership,"" he said.","布鲁金斯学会的中国政治专家李成也有类似看法。""通过将他的人提拔进入最高领导层，习近平进一步巩固了近乎绝对的权力，""他说。"
"The shake-up of China's leadership reflected a partial break with an informal rule of the past two decades: that senior officials 68 and older retired at party congresses, while those 67 or younger stayed on. Mr. Li, 67, and Mr. Wang, the same age, were both out. But Wang Huning, who recently turned 67, stayed on the Central Committee and is likely to remain a key political lieutenant to Mr. Xi, who is 69.",中国领导层的变动反映了过去二十年的不成文规则已经遭到一定破坏:即68岁及以上的高级官员应在党代会上退休，而67岁及以下的会留任。67岁的李克强和汪洋都退了。但最近刚满67岁的王沪宁留在了中央委员会，很可能仍会是69岁的习近平的重要政治副手。
"Officials seen as possible additions to the next Politburo Standing Committee include Li Qiang, the party chief of Shanghai, who oversaw its bruising Covid lockdown earlier this year. He was essentially Mr. Xi's chief of staff when both worked in Zhejiang Province 15 years ago. Ding Xuexiang, currently a senior aide to Mr. Xi, is also a strong contender for elevation into the next top lineup.",被认为可能增补进下届政治局常委名单的官员包括上海市委书记、在今年早些时候负责实施了严酷的新冠封锁的李强。15年前，他与习近平都在浙江任职，是习近平实质上的幕僚长。现为习近平的高级助手的丁薛祥也是进入下届领导集团的有力竞争者。
"The makeup of the new Central Committee suggested that Mr. Xi was generally happy with the handling of China's diplomacy, military affairs and domestic security, several analysts said.",多位分析人士表示，新一届中央委员会的构成表明，习近平对中国外交、军事和国内安全事务的处理总体上是满意的。
"China's ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, was promoted to full membership in the Central Committee. He had worked closely with Mr. Xi as the foreign ministry's head of protocol soon after Mr. Xi became China's top leader, and now has a rank in the party that leaves him well positioned to play an even larger role in China's foreign policy.",中国驻美大使秦刚晋升为中央委员。在习近平成为中国最高领导人后不久，秦刚曾作为外交部礼宾司司长密切配合习近平的工作，如今他在党内的地位使他能够在中国外交政策上发挥更大的作用。
"Mr. Xi kept on board Zhang Youxia, a military commander who, at age 72, had been widely expected to retire. General Zhang has been at the forefront of modernizing the People's Liberation Army, and has combat experience in China's border conflict with Vietnam from 1979.",习近平还留下了72岁的军方领导人张又侠，外界普遍预计他将退休。主导了解放军现代化的张又侠上将在1979年开始的中越边境冲突中获得了实战经验。
"""By pushing moderates and potential rivals out of the leadership, Xi conveys his overall priorities for sociopolitical stability, national security and policy continuity now and in the years to come,"" said Mr. Li, the Brookings expert.","""通过将温和派和潜在竞争对手赶出领导层，习近平传达出的是，他现在和未来几年的总体优先事项是社会政治稳定、国家安全和政策连续性，""布鲁金斯学会专家李成表示。"
"In his first years as China's leader, Xi Jinping paid for his own steamed dumplings in a cheap diner, casually rolled up his trouser legs to avoid splashes in the rain, and was serenaded with sugary pop tunes. His image-makers cast him as ""Xi Dada,"" the people's firm but genial ""Uncle Xi.""","在担任中国领导人的最初几年里，习近平会去廉价餐馆自己掏钱买包子吃，大大咧咧把裤管卷起以免被雨水溅到，人们用甜腻的流行小曲称颂他。他的形象设计者将他塑造成""习大大""——人民心中的一位坚定而和蔼的""习伯伯""。"
"How vastly different now. A decade on, Mr. Xi looms over the country like a stern Communist monarch, reflecting on China's fallen ancient dynasties and determined to win its lasting ascendancy in a turbulent world.",这跟现在是天差地别。十年后，习近平像一个严厉的共产主义君王，凌驾于这个国家之上，他反思中国古代那些覆灭的王朝，决心在一个动荡的世界里实现江山永固的伟业。
"Chinese officials praise his speeches like hallowed texts, professing loyalty with a fervor that sometimes echoes Mao Zedong's era. Privately mocking Mr. Xi can lead to prison. His public encounters are regimented displays of acclaim.",中国官员像对待神圣的经文一般赞美他的讲话，表忠心的狂热言语有时让人想到毛泽东时代。私下里贬损习近平可能会惹来牢狱之灾。在公开场合与他见面，需要按照事先的编排表达对他的赞扬。
"A Communist Party congress opening Sunday is shaping up to be Mr. Xi's imperial moment, strengthening and extending his rule, while also intensifying the long-term hazards from his singular dominance. At the meeting in Beijing, he seems sure of winning a third term as the party's general secretary, breaking with recent expectations that Chinese leaders would reign for around a decade.",本周日开幕的中共全国代表大会，看起来将成为习近平走上帝位的时刻，让他的统治得到加固和延续，同时也加剧他的一人独大带来的长期风险。在这场于北京举行的会议中，他似乎可以肯定会得到中共中央总书记的第三个任期，这与过去一段时间里的惯例——即中国每十年左右更换一次领导人——是相悖的。
"""The certainty will really only be in the arrangements at the topmost level, that his power is beyond challenge, but beneath that we'll face a great many uncertainties,"" Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said in an interview.","""这确定性实际上只是在最高层安排的确定性，就是他的权力是不可挑战的，但是我们在这种确定性之下我们就会面临大量的不确定性，""身在北京的政治分析人士吴强在采访中说。"
"The evolution of Mr. Xi's public face has paralleled his transformation of China into a proudly authoritarian state, scornful of criticism from Washington, increasingly sure that Western democracy has lost its allure, and impatient for a bigger say in shaping the 21st-century global order.",习近平的公众形象的演变与他将中国转变为一个更自豪的威权国家的过程是相呼应的，这个国家对华盛顿的批评不屑一顾，越来越确信西式民主已经失去了光环，迫不及待地想在21世纪全球秩序的塑造中掌握更多话语权。
"The party congress will be Mr. Xi's stage to demonstrate that he remains undaunted, despite the recent economic malaise, Covid outbreaks and increasing animosity with the United States, which has labeled China a national security threat. He is likely to tell the 2,296 congress delegates that his government has saved many lives through its strict ""zero Covid"" policy; shifted the economy onto a path of cleaner, fairer and more efficient growth; raised China's international standing; and made big strides in military modernization.","党代会将是习近平的舞台，用来证明他仍然无所畏惧，尽管近年面临着经济困局、新冠疫情以及美国越来越明确的敌意，后者已经将中国定性为国家安全威胁。他很可能会对2296位代表说，他的政府通过严厉的""清零""政策挽救了大量生命;让经济转向了一条更清洁、更公平、更高效的增长道路;提升了中国在国际上的地位;在军事现代化上取得重大进展。"
"""He wants to show that he's determined to do big things,"" said Neil Thomas, an analyst of Chinese politics for the Eurasia Group. ""He sees his historical role as breaking the historical cycle of dynastic rise and fall so the Communist Party remains in power pretty much forever.""","""他想证明自己有做大事的决心，""欧亚集团中国政治分析师尼尔·托马斯说。""他认为自己的历史使命是打破王朝兴衰的历史周期，让中国共产党永远掌权。"""
"Mr. Xi, 69, presents himself as the history-steeped guardian of China's destiny. He cites the toppling of China's ancient empires, determined to ensure that it does not again fall prey to political decay, revolt or foreign aggression. He quotes advice to emperors on ensuring obedience, ""like the arm commands the finger.""","现年69岁的习近平将自己塑造成一个深谙历史的中国命运守卫者。他以中国古代帝王的覆灭为鉴，一心要确保这个国家不再成为政治腐化、叛乱或外敌入侵的牺牲品。他引用了古人向皇帝的谏言""如臂使指""来说明该如何确保人民的服从。"
"He has taken to using a grand, ancient-sounding Chinese motto, guo zhi da zhe: roughly meaning ""the nation's great cause."" It sounds like it could have been passed down from a sage; in fact, Mr. Xi or his advisers minted it in 2020.","他使用了一句宏大的、有古文味道的格言""国之大者"":大致意思是""国家的重大目标""。听起来像是世代流传的至理名言，实际上是习近平或他的顾问在2020年创造的。"
"Mr. Xi is already looking well beyond the next five years, trying to build a lasting edifice of power and policies. He is fleshing out his own creed and promoting cohorts of younger proteges, technocrats and military commanders who may advance his influence for decades. Entrenching his central status was of ""decisive significance"" for China's rise, said a gathering of senior officials preparing for the congress.","习近平的目光并不止于未来五年，他试图建立一个持久的权力与政策大厦。他正在令自己的信条进一步丰满，并提拔一批年轻的门生、技术专家和军事指挥官，这些人可能会在几十年内提升他的影响力。准备参加大会的高级官员表示，巩固他的中心地位对中国的崛起具有""决定性意义""。"
"""Xi Jinping wants to show that he isn't just a party leader but also almost a spiritual seer for China a bold, visionary statesman,"" said Feng Chongyi, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney who studies recent Chinese political history.","""习近平是想证明他不只一个政党领袖而几乎也是中国一个精神导师，一个雄才大略(的人)，""悉尼科技大学研究中国近代政治史的副教授冯崇义说。"
"Surrounded by deferential functionaries, Mr. Xi may become more prone to swaggering oversteps. Unanswered questions over how long he will stay in power, and when he will name a successor, could unsettle officials, investors and other governments. Most experts believe he will not assign an heir at this congress, wary of undercutting his authority.",在顺从的职能部门簇拥下，习近平可能会更倾向于公然越权行事。关于他将执政多长时间以及他何时指定继任者的问题尚未得到回答，这可能会使官员、投资者和其他政府感到不安。大多数专家认为，他不会在这次大会上指定继承人，因为他害怕削弱自己的权威。
"If China's growth continues to stumble, Mr. Xi may have less largess for big technological programs and marquee projects like Xiong'an, an unfinished city of neat boulevards and office blocks outside of Beijing whose design exemplifies his ideas of an orderly, advanced society. It will also add to strains on his economic agenda, which has prioritized the state's interests to the frustration of private investors.",如果中国的经济增长继续下滑，习近平可能会减少对大型技术项目和雄安等标志性项目的投入，雄安是北京郊区一座由整齐的林荫道和办公大楼组成的未完工城市，其设计体现了他对有序、先进社会的想法。这也将为他的经济议程增加压力，该议程优先考虑国家利益，给私人投资者带来困扰。
"""We're still not in an era where the economy and society totally obey him,"" Mr. Wu said. ""The strains and tensions between politics and economics in the next five years will be more serious than the previous decade.""","""经济社会还不是完全听从他的一个时代，""吴强说。""未来五年政治经济之间这种矛盾紧张会比过去十年更严重。"""
"One day after Mr. Xi was first appointed party leader in November 2012, dozens of professors, lawyers and retired officials gathered in a Beijing hotel, urging China's new government to take up political liberalization as a cure for corruption and abuses. ""Democracy, rule of law, human rights and constitutional government are the unstoppable global tide,"" their petition said.","2012年11月，习近平首次被任命为党的领导人后的一天，数十名教授、律师和退休官员聚集在北京一家酒店，敦促中国的新政府把政治自由化作为治疗腐败和滥用权力的良方。他们的请愿书上写道:""民主、法治、人权、宪政是不可阻挡的世界潮流。"""
"After decades climbing the administrative ladder in brashly commercial coastal areas, Mr. Xi took power amid widespread expectations that he would be a pragmatist willing to tolerate, if not act on, such calls. Many pointed to the probable influence of his father, an official who served under Deng Xiaoping as the country was embarking on market reforms and opening up in the 1980s.",几十年来，习近平一直在高度商业化的沿海地区官场往上爬，因此人们普遍认为他会是一个务实主义者，即使不采取行动，也愿意容忍这种呼声。许多人指出，他的父亲在20世纪80年代中国开始进行市场改革和开放时，曾在邓小平手下任职，这也可能产生影响。
"Mr. Xi's initial promises of a ""China Dream"" were opaque enough to lift some hopes. But political insiders quickly began to sense Mr. Xi's hard-line direction, especially after scornful comments in late 2012 about former Soviet reformers.","习近平对""中国梦""的最初承诺并不分明，足以唤起一些希望。但政界内部人士很快开始感觉到习近平的强硬方向，特别是在2012年底他对前苏联改革者发表轻蔑的评论之后。"
"""Those retired liberal cadres began to think, 'He's really not going to be one of us',"" said Professor Feng, the Sydney academic, who was in Beijing when Mr. Xi's comments spread.","""那些退休的自由派干部开始觉得，'他的确不会成为我们中的一员'""悉尼学者冯崇义说，习近平上述言论传开时他正在北京。"
"Five months later, Mr. Xi issued an edict condemning human rights and rule of law, which he deemed to be vehicles for Western-backed subversion. Step by step since, he has silenced dissent and erected a pervasive national security apparatus to defend the party and himself.",五个月后，习近平发布了一项谴责人权和法治的法令，他认为这些都是受西方支持的颠覆工具。此后，他一步步压制异议，建立了一个无孔不入的国家安全机构来保卫党和他自己。
"Ten years on, the Beijing magazine that organized the 2012 meeting has been purged. Many older officials who signed the petition have since died; a businessman who put his name to it was imprisoned; other attendees have retreated into silence or embraced Mr. Xi's agenda.",十年过去了，北京那家曾组织2012年会议的杂志已被清洗。许多在请愿书上签名的老干部已去世;一位在请愿书上签名的商人被关进监狱;其他参与者则不再发声，或接受了习近平的议程。
"In Mr. Xi's worldview, the party is the custodian of traditional Chinese hierarchy and discipline, set against the dysfunction of democracies. He argues that the party's centralized power can mobilize China to accomplish feats beyond the grasp of Western countries, like cutting rural poverty, leaping into new technologies, or so it seemed for a while efficiently halting the spread of Covid.",在习近平的世界观中，党是中国传统等级制度和纪律的守护者，这些制度和纪律与民主国家的功能失调形成了对比。他认为，党的中央集权可以动员中国完成西方国家无法实现的壮举，比如减少农村贫困，迅速转向新技术，或者——有一段时间似乎是这样——有效地阻止新冠病毒的传播。
"""The superiority of our political system and system of governance is even more blazingly clear in its response to the Covid pandemic and winning the war on poverty,"" Mr. Xi said in March. ""The contrast between Chinese order and Western chaos has become even sharper.""","""我国政治制度和治理体系在应对新冠肺炎疫情、打赢脱贫攻坚战等实践中进一步彰显显著优越性，'中国之治'与'西方之乱'对比更加鲜明，""习近平在3月说。"
"Several months later, by the time Mr. Xi called together hundreds of officials to hear plans for the congress, the public mood in China had shifted markedly.",几个月后，当习近平召集数百名官员听取大会计划之际，中国的公众情绪已经发生了明显的转变。
"The government's severe measures against incessant outbreaks have fed rising frustration. China's economy has been caught in a painful slowdown, brought on by the pandemic restrictions and by steps to rein in big tech firms and debt-heavy developers. And Mr. Xi's fellow strongman, Vladimir V. Putin, has been mired in the floundering Ukraine invasion, forcing Beijing into diplomatic contortions.",政府对不断暴发的疫情采取的严厉措施，让人民的不满不断加剧。中国的经济已陷入痛苦的放缓，这是由疫情限制、控制大型科技公司和债台高筑的开发商所带来的。而与习近平同为强人领袖的普京一直深陷于入侵乌克兰的困境之中，迫使北京在外交上做出调整。
"Mr. Xi was unbowed. He told the assembled officials that China had to focus on steeling itself for an increasingly turbulent world. It was another instance of how he has turned a potential liability China's mood of embattled vulnerability into a foundation for hard-line policies, and an instrument to marshal obedience.",习近平没有被吓倒。他告诉与会的官员，中国必须专注于为一个日益动荡的世界做好准备。这又一次说明他如何将一个潜在的麻烦——中国陷入困境的脆弱情绪——转化为强硬政策的基础和争取服从的工具。
"""In the midst of struggle, we have been defending national dignity and core interests,"" Mr. Xi told the officials, shown vigorously applauding him.","""我们在斗争中维护国家尊严和核心利益，""习近平对官员们说，后者对他报以热烈掌声。"
"Mr. Xi rarely singles out the United States by name, but his warnings are clear enough. Rifts with the Trump and Biden administrations over technology sales, human rights and Taiwan appear to have hardened his distrust of Western intentions.",习近平很少点名美国，但他的警告足够明确。与特朗普和拜登政府在技术出售、人权和台湾问题上的分歧似乎使他对西方的意图更加不信任。
"President Biden's new national security strategy is likely to intensify Beijing's wariness. In it, Mr. Biden called China ""the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective.""","拜登总统的新国家安全战略可能会加剧北京的戒心。在该战略中，拜登称中国是""唯一一个既有重塑国际秩序的意图，又有越来越多的经济、外交、军事和技术力量来推进这一目标的国家""。"
"Mr. Xi has previously said that ""time and momentum"" are on China's side, and called the United States the ""biggest source of chaos in the present-day world.""","习近平此前曾表示，""时与势""在中国一边，并称美国是""当今世界最大的乱源""。"
"As the congress has neared, senior Chinese officials have garlanded Mr. Xi, the ""core"" leader, in vows of utter loyalty. ""Embrace the core with a sincere heart,"" said one. ""At all times and in all circumstances, trust the core, be loyal to the core, defend the core,"" said another.","大会临近之际，中国高级官员向""核心""领导人习近平表忠心，宣告自己的绝对忠诚。一人写道:""感情上衷心拥戴核心。""另一人写道:""任何时候任何情况下都信赖核心、忠诚核心、维护核心。"""
But Mr. Xi will need more than loyalty oaths to achieve his goals. His ambitions to build China into a technological titan are bringing to the fore a new breed of Chinese technocrats: scientists and engineers who have made their mark on projects like the space program.,但为了实现目标，习近平需要的不仅仅是忠诚誓言。他将中国建设成为科技巨头的雄心，正在将新一代的中国技术官僚推向幕前:在太空计划等项目上取得成功的科学家和工程师。
"""We must demonstrate the clear superiority of our country's socialist system in being able to concentrate forces to achieve big feats,"" Mr. Xi said at a meeting on technological innovation last month.","习近平在上个月召开的一次科技创新会议上说:""我们要发挥我国社会主义制度能够集中力量办大事的显著优势。"""
"Mr. Xi's promotions into the Politburo the council of 25 top officials could include several officials emerging from the aeronautics and other cutting-edge sectors. Some already steer economic powerhouse provinces, including Zhang Qingwei in Hunan, and Yuan Jiajun, the secretary of Zhejiang, who directed China's Shenzhou manned spaceflight program.",政治局由25名高级官员组成，有可能被习近平提拔进入政治局的人包括几名来自航空和其他前沿领域的官员。其中一些人已在掌舵经济强省，包括湖南的张庆伟和指挥中国神舟载人航天计划的浙江省委书记袁家军。
"""Given the challenges of the Chinese economy and a less hospitable external environment, technocrat leaders will likely be leaned on even more,"" said Damien Ma, managing director of MacroPolo, an institute that studies China.","""鉴于中国经济面临的挑战和不太友好的外部环境，可能会更倾向于技术官僚领导人，""研究中国的机构麦克罗波洛智库的执行董事马旸说。"
"None of the rising officials appears positioned to soon emerge as Mr. Xi's heir apparent. There are no formal limits on how long he may rule, and his hold on power may weaken only if China suffers a profound crisis.",这些即将升迁的官员似乎都不会很快成为习近平的接班人。他的统治时间没有正式限制，只有当中国遭受严重危机时，他对权力的控制才会减弱。
"Mr. Wu, the analyst in Beijing, likened Mr. Xi's predominance to ""garbage time"" in a basketball game: when the score is so lopsided that changes in the team in the final stretch make little difference.","北京的分析人士吴强将习近平的主导地位比作篮球比赛中的""垃圾时间"":当比分差距太大时，球队在最后阶段的换人几乎不会产生什么改变。"
"""Other players may leave the court, and others may go on and even score a beautiful three-pointer, and everyone will cheer,"" he said. ""But it won't affect the outcome.""","""一些球员可能会离场，另一些可能会继续比赛，甚至投进漂亮的三分球，大家会欢呼，""他说。""但不会影响结果。"""
"As fire was raging in the mountains surrounding the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, 10 million residents stood in 100-plus-degree heat to get Covid tests. Two cases were detected that day in August.",8月的一天，当大火在中国重庆周围的山区肆虐时，1000万居民在40度高温下接受新冠病毒检测。那天，重庆共发现了两例确诊病例。
"A week earlier in Xiamen, in the country's southeast, pandemic workers swabbed the throats of fishermen before they tested their catch of fish and crab. Cars got swabbed, too, at an auto show last week in Chengdu, in the southwest.",在那一周前，在厦门，防疫人员给渔民进行咽喉拭子检测后，对他们捕获的鱼蟹也做了检测。上周在西南部城市成都举行的车展上，汽车也做了检测。
"When a strong earthquake struck Chengdu on Monday, the first instinct of many residents was not to run for safety but to ask for permission to leave their homes underlockdown. ""Don't come downstairs! @all,"" a property managerwarnedin a group chat. In Luding County, the epicenter of the earthquake, which killed at least 86 people, the local government told residents to make sure they got tested every day.","周一，当成都发生强烈地震时，许多居民的第一反应不是逃命，而是请求允许他们离开被封锁的住所。""大家不要下楼!!@所有人，""一名物业经理在微信群中警告。在震中泸定县，地震造成至少86人遇难，当地政府要求居民每天须做核酸。"
"As much of the world tries to move on from thepandemic, the Chinese Communist Party clings to it, turning itszero-Covidpolicy into a political campaign that mandates the participation of 1.4 billion people.",当世界上大部分地区都在试图走出新冠疫情之际，中国共产党仍然毫不动摇，将清零政策转变为一场强制要求14亿人参与的政治运动。
"In their precarious existence filled with lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing, the Chinese public puts up a show, 24/7, for an audience of one: the country's top leader, Xi Jinping, who is expected to secure a third term at an importantCommunist Party congressnext month.",在充斥着封锁、隔离和大规模检测等不确定性的生活中，中国公众每天24小时不间断地举办着一场表演，这场表演的观众只有一个:中国最高领导人习近平，预计他将在下月举行的一个重要的共产党代表大会上获得第三个任期。
"Some people play their roles with enthusiasm, others with indifference or resentment. No matter what, the Kafkaesque show must go on until Mr. Xi says, ""Stop.""","有些人在扮演他们的角色时充满热情，有些人则表现出冷漠或怨恨。无论如何，卡夫卡式的表演必须持续到习近平喊""停""为止。"
"The zero-Covid campaign is probably the clearest testament to the power of Mr. Xi, who proved that he is as capable of mobilizing the masses asMao Zedong, the founder of the People's Republic of China, who launched the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.",新冠清零运动可能是对习近平的权力最为明确的证明，他证明了自己和毛泽东一样具有发动群众的能力。毛泽东是中华人民共和国的创立者，发动了大跃进和文化大革命。
"Mao didn't care that people starved to death or that the country was thrown into chaos in those two disastrous campaigns. Mr. Xi doesn't seem to care that his campaign has been extremely disruptive even as the coronavirus has become much milder, if more transmittable.",毛泽东不在乎人们被饿死，也不在乎国家在这两场灾难性运动中陷入混乱。习近平似乎也不在乎他的这场运动已极具破坏性，尽管新冠病毒已经变得温和许多(虽然传播性也许更强)。
"His strategy has contained the pandemic. China reports fewer than 2,000 new cases each day of late, most of them asymptomatic. The country has reported 5,226 Covid-related deaths since early 2020 and none since May, according to the National Health Commission.",他的策略控制住了疫情。中国最近每天报告的新增病例不到2000例，其中大多数是无症状感染者。根据国家卫健委的数据，自2020年初以来，中国共报告了5226例与新冠病毒相关的死亡，自5月以来就没有新增死亡病例。
"China's authoritarian approach proved especiallyeffectivein much of 2020 and 2021, when the United States and Europe were struggling with high death and infection rates. Mr. Xi has been using the temporary success as evidence that China's top-down governance model is superior to that of liberal democracies. He refuses to abandon his old playbook of lockdowns, mass testing and quarantines in favor of learning to coexist with the milder variants that emerged this year.",在2020年和2021年的大部分时间里，中国的威权主义方法被证明尤其有效，当时的美国和欧洲都苦于高死亡率和高感染率。习近平一直以当时暂时的成功作为证据，来证明中国自上而下的治理模式优于自由民主国家。他拒绝放弃封锁、大规模检测和隔离的老办法，不愿转而学习与今年出现的较温和的病毒变种共存。
"As of Tuesday, 49 Chinese cities were imposing some sort of lockdown measures, affecting around 292 million people, up from 161 million in the previous week, according to the investment bank Nomura. It's taking a serious economic toll. At the beginning of the year, Nomura expected China's economy to grow 4.3 percent in 2022. After successive rounds of lockdowns, it lowered its forecast to 2.7 percent.",根据投资银行野村证券的数据，截至上周二，中国有49个城市实施了某种形式的封锁，约2.92亿人受到影响，高于前一周的1.61亿人。这造成了严重的经济损失。今年年初，野村证券预计中国2022年经济增长将达到4.3%。在连续几轮封锁之后，它将预测下调至2.7%。
"The Communist Party has defended its policy, saying that relaxing the Covid restrictions could cause widespread infections in a country with limited medical resources and a large population of older people, among whom 15 percent are not fully vaccinated. The partysaidit would crack down on any speech or behavior that distorted, questioned or disapproved of the policy.",中共为它的防疫政策进行了辩护，称在一个医疗资源总量不足、老龄人口多的国家(15%的老年人没有完全接种疫苗)，放松疫情防控势必造成大规模人群感染。中共表示，坚决同一切歪曲、怀疑、否定防疫方针政策的言行作斗争。
Many Chinese buy into the narrative and willingly act as foot soldiers in the party's fight against the virus.,许多中国人相信这个说法，并愿意在党的抗击病毒斗争中充当走卒。
"Last week, passengers on a bus in the northeastern city of Dalian scolded a man for wearing merely a surgical mask, not an N95 respirator mask that the local government required in an announcement a few hours earlier. ""Get off the bus!"" they yelled at the man, according to official Chinesemedia. ""You're wicked."" One of the passengers called the police, who led him off the bus.","上周，在大连的一辆公共汽车上，乘客斥责一名只戴了外科口罩的男子，因为他未按当地政府数小时前发布公告要求佩戴的N95口罩。""下去吧!""据中国官方媒体报道，他们朝这名男子大喊道。""缺德。""一名乘客报了警，警察将他带下车。"
"Dalian reported 40 Covid infection cases, all asymptomatic, that day. The next day the government locked down the city of seven million people and suspended all public transportation.",大连当天报告了40例确诊病例，均为无症状感染者。第二天，政府封锁了这座有700万人口的城市，并暂停了所有公共交通。
"A tech writer shared in a WeChatpostlast weekend that he and his wife had caught Covid in Singapore, and that they, as well as the city-state, were doing just fine far from the horror stories that many Chinese people were led to believe. The pandemic was over for most countries in the world, he declared.",一名科技类作者上周末在微信公众号中写道，他和妻子在新加坡感染了新冠，他们以及这个城市国家的情况都不错——远非许多中国人被引导相信的恐怖故事。他断言，世界上大多数国家的疫情已经结束。
"""You're doing fine,"" a reader in Beijing commented, ""but can you be sure the others will be fine, too? So selfish. Unfollowed. ""","""你没事，""北京的一位读者评论道，""能保证其他人没事吗?这么自私，取关了。"""
"What gives the campaign the most Kafkaesque quality is that no matter how bizarre, absurd or illogical the rules are, most people follow them without question.",这场运动最卡夫卡式的特质在于，无论规则多么离奇、荒谬或不合逻辑，大多数人都会毫不犹豫地遵守。
"When China's national team played in the 2022 Asian Women's Volleyball Cup in the Philippines last month, the players followed instructions from higher-ups to wearmasksand lost their first set against Iran. The team won the match after the players took off the masks.",上个月，中国国家队在菲律宾出战2022年女排亚洲杯比赛时，队员们听从上级指示戴上口罩，首局输给了伊朗队。后来球员摘下口罩，球队赢得了比赛。
"A woman living in a small city in northwestern China told me that she'd had many arguments with her husband and her parents after they told her to stop complaining about Covid restrictions. Everyone was following the rules, they scolded her, why couldn't you?",一名住在中国西北一座小城市的女士告诉我，她和丈夫及她的父母吵过很多次，他们叫她不要再抱怨防疫管控措施了。他们说她，大家都能守规矩，你为什么就不行呢?
"She shared photos and videos of pandemic life in her small town last week. Loudspeakers started blasting at 5 a.m., urging residents to get tested. For hours, the same piercing instructions would blare throughout the city: ""Property owners, please come down to get Covid tests. It will end at 9.""","上周，她分享了小城疫情生活的照片和视频。每天早上五点，大喇叭开始响起，敦促大家做检测。在接下来的几个小时，同样刺耳的声音会在全城响起:""各位业主，请下楼做核酸检测。9点结束。"""
"Her 5-year-old daughter was always eager to get tested, she said, because otherwise she wouldn't be able to go out and play with her friends.",她说，自己五岁的女儿总是盼着接受检测，否则就没法出去跟朋友们玩耍。
"After each Covid test, a person gets a sticker, and most put it on the back of their phones, said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for safety reasons. The sticker is different every day. It could be a cartoonish drawing of a police officer, a volunteer or a famous historical figure.",这名女士表示，在每次核酸检测后，每个人都会得到一张贴纸，大多数人会把它贴在手机背面。出于安全原因，她要求匿名。贴纸每天都不一样，有时是警察、志愿者或著名历史人物的卡通画。
"Residents have to show the stickers to security guards in office buildings, residential compounds, shopping malls and schools. Without it, they can't move around.",居民必须向写字楼、住宅区、商场和学校的保安人员出示贴纸。没有贴纸，他们就无法四处走动。
"Local authorities have become increasingly harsh in punishing those who don't follow the zero-Covid rules. In recent months, many people weredetainedby the police for five to 10 days for failing to get Covid tests. Officers in the northwestern province of Shaanxi detained a 20-year-old man for five days in August because he hadskippedtwo Covid tests and had ridden a bike. His behavior ""posed risks of spreading the virus,"" they said.","对于那些不遵守清零规则的人，地方当局的惩罚变得越来越严厉。近几个月来，许多人因没有接受新冠检测而被警方拘留五至10天。8月，陕西的警察将一名20岁的男子拘留五天，原因是他两次没有参加核酸检测，并在外面骑自行车。他们说，他的行为""存在疫情传播风险""。"
"Pandemic control workers, in their white hazmat suits, have come to embody the absurdity and the brutality of the campaign.",身着白色防护服的防疫人员已经成为这场运动之荒谬和残酷的具体体现。
"Nicknamed Dabai, or Big White, they are omnipresent. They rode onhorsebackto test Tibetan herdsmen. Theywalkedin heavy snow in China's westernmost county to swab the throats of border patrol agents. They even regularlytestedthe staff in China's research stations in Antarctica.","绰号""大白""的防疫人员无所不在。他们骑着马去给藏族牧民做核酸采样。他们冒着大雪走在中国最西部的县城，给护边员做核酸。他们甚至定期对中国南极科考站的工作人员进行检测。"
There's no way to avoid the Big White.,"没人能躲过""大白""。"
"In a widely shared video on Chinese social media, a giant inflated Big White rose over the city ofWuhan, where the coronavirus was first reported.","在中国社交媒体上广为流传的一段视频中，一只巨大的充气""大白""在武汉上空升起，这里是首次报告新冠病毒的地方。"
"""The white terror"" and ""The Big White is watching you"" are among the most-liked comments. So is ""Please test the Yangtze River Bridge,"" which refers to the bridge in the video.","在最多人点赞的评论中包括""白色恐怖""和""大白在看着你""。还有""请检测长江大桥""——指的是视频中的大桥。"
"In his decade of ruling China, Xi Jinping has tried to imbue its people with confidence, telling them that the country is doing very well compared with the chaotic West.",在统治中国的十年里，习近平一直试图激发人民的信心，告诉他们，与混乱的西方相比，中国蒸蒸日上。
"He has told the younger generation that China can finally look at the world as an equal. ""It's no longer as backward,"" he said last year.","他告诉年轻一代，中国终于可以平视世界了。""不像我们当年那么'土'了，""他去年说道。"
"""The East is rising and the West is declining,"" he declared, at a time when the United States and other Western countries seemed mired in high Covid infection rates, racial tensions and other problems.","在美国和其他西方国家似乎陷入新冠病毒的高感染率、种族冲突和其他问题的困境时，他宣称""东升西降""。"
"Mr. Xi has told China's 1.4 billion people to be proud of its culture, its governance system and its future as a great power, all of which adds up to his signature political philosophy, sometimes called the ""confidence doctrine.""","习近平告诉14亿中国人民，要以本国的文化、治理体系和未来的强国地位为豪，这些都是他标志性的政治理念，有时被称为""自信论""。"
"While much of that pride is well placed, it also breeds cockiness. It gives Mr. Xi a justification for unwinding the policies of openness that helped China emerge from international isolation and abject poverty under Mao. It has also given a boost to extreme nationalists who trumpet Chinese superiority, and who are now urging military confrontation with Taiwan after Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit.",虽然这种自豪大部分有道理，但也会滋生自大，让习近平有理由放弃开放政策，这些政策曾帮助中国摆脱了毛泽东时代的国际孤立和赤贫状态。这种自豪也助长了极端民族主义者，他们鼓吹中国至上，在美国众议院议长佩洛西访台后，呼吁与台湾进行军事对峙。
"Their strident rhetoric shows how little they think of American power and how easily they think China would win a great-power competition with the United States. It is making more moderate nationalists feel uncomfortable, raising fears that Beijing could feel compelled to act tough.",咄咄逼人的言辞表明他们对美国的实力是多么不以为然，并且认为中国在与美国的大国竞争中取胜易如反掌。这已让更温和的民族主义者感到不安，引发了人们对中国政府可能会被迫做出强硬姿态的担忧。
"Such posturing and nationalistic sentiment heighten the risk of war, especially as China establishes a new status quo with Taiwan, announcing on Tuesday that it would continue air and sea drills around the island democracy.",这种姿态和民族主义情绪加剧了战争风险，尤其是中国正在台湾问题上建立一种新现状的时候，周二它宣布，继续在这个民主自治岛屿周围进行空中和海上军演。
"And in the context of the U.S.-China rivalry, this tendency toward overconfidence could also prove to be a weakness for Beijing, blinding it to its own challenges. It could be a blessing for the United States, if it can get its act together.",在美中竞争的背景下，过度自信的倾向对北京来说也可能会成为一个弱点，使其对自身面临的挑战视而不见。如果美国能集中精力的话，这对它来说可能是好事。
"The Chinese people, not the government, have every reason to feel proud and confident in their achievements over the past four decades.",中国人民，而不是中国政府，完全有理由对过去四十年取得的成就感到自豪和自信。
"They lifted themselves from poverty and created some of the most successful companies on earth. They made their country a manufacturing colossus and the biggest consumer market for cars, smartphones and many luxury brands. They built new skyscrapers, subways, highways and high-speed railways, some of the best in the world.",他们使自己摆脱了贫困，创建了地球上一些最成功的公司。他们把自己的国家变成了一个制造业巨头，变成了汽车、智能手机和许多奢侈品牌的最大消费市场。他们建造了新的摩天大楼、地铁、高速公路和高铁，其中一些是世界上最好的。
"The United States, on the other hand, has seemed embroiled in its many domestic problems and often too paralyzed to sort through its issues.",另一方面，美国似乎陷入了众多国内问题的泥潭，在这些问题面前常常显得无能为力。
"Before the pandemic, I got used to Chinese people coming back from trips to the United States and telling me how backward, shabby and underwhelming they had found it to be.",早在这次疫情之前，我就已习惯了从美国旅行归来的中国人对我说，他们看到的美国多么落后、破烂不堪和平淡无奇。
"Some of them refused to take the New York subway system, saying it was dirty, smelly and full of service disruptions. They were appalled by the lack of public transportation in Los Angeles and the poor highway conditions in Silicon Valley. They didn't understand why wealthy San Francisco was plagued with homelessness. They were greatly disturbed by gun violence and the failure of laws to control it.",他们中有些人不愿乘坐纽约的地铁，称它又脏又臭，而且运行经常中断。他们对洛杉矶缺乏公共交通和硅谷糟糕的高速公路感到震惊。他们不明白为什么富裕的旧金山会充斥着无家可归者。他们对枪支暴力、不能用法律控制枪支感到非常不安。
"Most of those people weren't nationalists. They were educated elites who grew up in poverty, benefited from China's opening up and had seen the United States as an ideal. The United States awed and disappointed them at the same time.",这些人中的大多数并非民族主义者。他们是在贫困中长大、受过高等教育的精英，受益于中国的开放，曾把美国视为理想。美国既让他们惊叹又让他们失望。
"But for many other Chinese, especially younger ones, the idea of a rising East and a declining West is an accepted fact. News programs and social media are filled with such dogma, and political science classes, at the urging of Mr. Xi, are teaching it.","但对于许多其他中国人来说，尤其是年轻的中国人，""东升西降""已是一个公认的事实。新闻节目和社交媒体上充斥着这样的教条，政治课也在习近平的要求下讲授这个概念。"
"Yan Xuetong, a professor of international studies at Tsinghua University with a nationalistic bent, said at a Beijing conference in January that China's college students need to learn more about the world. They often have a binary view, believing that ""only China is just and innocent while all other countries, especially the Western countries, are 'evil,' and that Westerners are bound to hate China,"" he said. Students ""usually have a very strong sense of superiority and confidence"" in international relations, he said, and often ""treat the other countries with a condescending mind-set.""","今年1月在北京的一个会议上，具有民族主义倾向的清华大学国际关系学教授阎学通说，中国的大学生需要更多地了解世界。他说，大学生""常以中国与外国两分的方法看待世界""，""认为只有中国是正义的和无辜的，其他国家特别是西方国家是'邪恶'的、西方人对中国有着天然仇恨。""学生""具有强烈的优越感和自信心，""他说。""常以'居高临下'的心态看待其他国家。"""
"""They use 'wishful thinking' in international affairs, believing that it's very easy for China to achieve its foreign policy objectives,"" said Professor Yan. He added that they also tend to believe conspiracy theories and other unsubstantiated opinions found online.","他们""以'愿望思维'看待国际事务，认为中国很容易实现对外政策目标，""阎学通说。他还表示，大学生也倾向于相信网上流传的阴谋论和其他未经证实的说法。"
"Many young people criticized him in turn, accusing him of condescension.",许多年轻人反过来批评了他，指责他居高临下。
"Chinese propaganda has always tried to highlight China's achievements and the West's failures. On Dec. 30, 1958, when China was entering the Great Famine that would result in the death of millions by starvation, the front page of the People's Daily reported that the country was succeeding in industrial and agricultural production. In the international news section, stories about socialist countries like Vietnam and North Korea were celebratory, while ones about the capitalist West were all about their economic and political woes.",中国的宣传一直试图突出中国的成就和西方的失败。《人民日报》1958年12月30日的头版报道是，中国的工农业生产正在取得成功，但当时正在面临导致了数百万人死亡的大饥饿。在国际新闻版，关于越南和朝鲜等社会主义国家的报道欢欣鼓舞，关于西方资本主义国家的报道都是它们的经济和政治困境。
"I grew up reading a newspaper column titled, ""Socialism is Good. Capitalism is Bad."" Each week, millions of young readers like myself would consume biased pieces about an American girl going hungry or a North Korean boy living a happy life. We believed them, until China opened up and we realized that our socialist country was impoverished.","我小时候读的报纸有一个""社会主义好、资本主义坏""的专栏。每周，成千上万像我这样的年轻读者读到的都是充满偏见的文章，比如一个美国女孩在挨饿，或一个朝鲜男孩过着幸福的生活。我们对这些文章深信无疑，直到中国打开了国门，我们才意识到我们的社会主义国家其实很穷。"
"That changed to a degree in the 1990s and 2000s, as the Chinese Communist Party allowed some investigative reporting and public online criticism. But under Mr. Xi, everything about China exudes ""positive energy,"" including economic forecasts, while the West, especially the United States, is increasingly portrayed as evil or in decline.","随着中共允许媒体发表一些调查性报道、允许公众在网上发表一些批评意见，人们读到的东西曾在1990年代和2000年代发生了一定程度的变化。但在习近平领导下，中国的一切、包括经济预测都充满了""正能量""，而西方则越来越多地被描述为邪恶或衰落，尤其是美国。"
"The state broadcaster Chinese Central Television, eager to give the party credit for the country's successes, made a documentary called ""Amazing China"" in 2018. In one section about achievements in poverty eradication, the film showed Mr. Xi sitting among farmers, talking about how their income had increased twentyfold in 20 years.",2018年，急于将国家取得的成就归功于中共的中央电视台，制作了一部名为《厉害了，我的国》的纪录片。在影片关于脱贫成就的部分，习近平坐在农民中间，谈他们的收入如何在20年里增长了20倍。
"""Who else could have done this?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Only the Communist Party could have done this. Only our socialist system could have done this. It couldn't have been done in any other places.""","""这个只有谁能做?""习近平反问道。""只有共产党能够做。我们社会主义制度能够做。别的地方是做不成的。"""
But capitalist countries like Japan and South Korea had gone through similar economic transformations decades earlier.,但日本和韩国等资本主义国家几十年前曾经历过类似的经济转变。
"In the past two years, many state news reports and theoretical essays have contrasted China's orderly governance with the ""messy West,"" citing the United States' mishandling of the pandemic, its widespread protests against racism and its many mass shootings. When the United States and a few other Western countries struggled with their Covid responses, state media and many Chinese social media influencers urged them to ""copy China's homework.""","过去两年里，许多官媒新闻报道和理论文章用中国的有序治理与""西方之乱""做对比，给出的例子包括美国在遏制新冠病毒大流行上的不得力、大范围的反对种族主义抗议，以及多起大规模枪击事件。当美国和一些其他西方国家在应对新冠病毒大流行上困难重重时，中国的官媒和许多社交媒体影响者呼吁这些国家""抄中国作业""。"
"Wang Jisi, a professor of international studies at Peking University and a top expert in U.S.-China relations, complained at a peace forum in July that C.C.T.V.'s main news program ran at least two stories about the United States every night, and that both were negative. ""They're either about the U.S. having another mass shooting, another example of racial tensions or its messy handling of the pandemic,"" he said. ""Why can't we talk about what's happening in Africa or Latin America and not talk about bad stuff in the U.S.?""","北京大学国际关系学教授王缉思是研究中美关系的主要专家，他在今年7月的一个和平论坛上抱怨，中央电视台的主要新闻节目中每晚至少有两条关于美国的负面报道。""美国枪击案又出现了、种族冲突又重现了、新冠疫情也弄的不好了，""他说。""我们能不能说说非洲的事情、说说拉丁美洲的事情，不每天说美国那些坏事情呢?"""
"In an interview with an academic journal this year, Mr. Wang tried to correct the idea that the United States is in decline. He argued that while America's international standing had experienced relative decline between 1995 and 2011, its share of global output rose in the decade after 2011. There is not enough evidence to conclude that America's economy is in irreversible decline, he said, though he acknowledged that U.S. soft power had diminished.",王缉思今年接受一家学术期刊采访时试图纠正美国正在衰落的观点。他提出理由说，虽然美国的国际地位在1995年至2011年间出现了相对下降，但美国在全球产出中占的份额在2011年后的10年中有所上升。他表示没有足够的证据表明美国经济正处于不可逆转的衰退中，尽管他承认美国的软实力已经减弱。
"For China, the danger of drinking its own propaganda Kool-Aid is that it stops looking at its own problems while exaggerating America's weaknesses.",对中国来说，喝自己宣传的迷魂汤的危险在于，在夸大美国弱点的同时不再关注自身的问题。
"The Communist Party's aversion to truth and its obsession with control are backfiring. Mr. Xi's zero-Covid policy, which relies on mass testing and lockdowns, is wreaking huge damage on the Chinese economy. But since no criticism is allowed, the country is largely going along with strict restrictions while much of the world is in the process of returning to normal.","中共对真相的厌恶和对控制的痴迷正在产生事与愿违的后果。习近平的""新冠清零""政策靠的是大规模检测和严格封控，已给中国经济造成了巨大损害。但由于不允许批评，中国仍在很大程度上实行严格限制的政策，而世界上大部分地区早已进入恢复正常生活的过程。"
"Despite all its issues, the American democratic system still seems to be working, with its checks and balances that allow for different views to win out and for new strategic approaches to emerge. The 2020 presidential election is an example, with the Democrats returning to power. So is Kansas's vote to preserve protections for abortion rights in its Constitution, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.","尽管存在种种问题，美国的民主制度似乎仍在运行，它的制衡机制允许不同的观点胜出，允许新的战略方法出现。民主党在2020年的总统大选中重新掌权，就是一个例子。最高法院推翻了""罗诉韦德案""后，堪萨斯州人民投票保留了州宪法中保护堕胎权的条款，也是个例子。"
Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act recently to help global semiconductor manufacturers set up operations in the country to better compete with China. And President Biden's administration is better at working with allies than his predecessor's was.,为帮助全球的半导体制造商在美国建工厂，以更好地与中国竞争，美国国会最近通过了《芯片和科学法案》。拜登总统的政府比前任政府更擅长与盟友合作。
"""When people stop queuing up for visas in front of the U.S. consulates,"" said Mr. Wang, the professor, ""then the U.S. is in decline.""","""当美国领事馆前等待签证的队伍不再人头攒动时，才是美国真正衰落之日，""王缉思说。"
